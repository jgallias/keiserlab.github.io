Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006033</href></item></canonical><engagement>5</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006033</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1628c98f9e7:4903d:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522777258471</crawled><fingerprint>a3308d99</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Javier A.

A key focus of the racing industry is to reduce the number of race-day events where horses die suddenly or are euthanased due to catastrophic injury. The objective of this study was therefore to determine risk factors for race-day fatalities in Thoroughbred racehorses, using a cohort of all horses participating in flat racing in Great Britain between 2000 and 2013. Horse-, race- and course-level data were collected and combined with all race-day fatalities, recorded by racecourse veterinarians in a central database. Associations between exposure variables and fatality were assessed using logistic regression analyses for (1) all starts in the dataset and (2) starts made on turf surfaces only. There were 806,764 starts in total, of which 548,571 were on turf surfaces. A total of 610 fatalities were recorded; 377 (61.8%) on turf. In both regression models, increased firmness of the going, increasing racing distance, increasing average horse performance, first year of racing and wearing eye cover for the first time all increased the odds of fatality. Generally, the odds of fatality also increased with increasing horse age whereas increasing number of previous starts reduced fatality odds. In the ‘all starts’ model, horses racing in an auction race were at 1.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–2.01) times the odds of fatality compared with horses not racing in this race type. In the turf starts model, horses racing in Group 1 races were at 3.19 (95% CI 1.71–5.93) times the odds of fatality compared with horses not racing in this race type. Identification of novel risk factors including wearing eye cover and race type will help to inform strategies to further reduce the rate of fatality in flat racing horses, enhancing horse and jockey welfare and safety.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Sarah M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Proprioception deficits are common post-stroke and predict poor functional outcome. It is unknown if the presence of proprioception deficits is negatively associated with the motor and functional ability of the affected upper extremity and daily living at the chronic stage post-stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Aims &lt;p&gt;1) To describe proprioception deficits of individuals with chronic stroke, 2) to correlate the severity of proprioception deficits with the motor and functional ability of the upper extremity, and 3) to compare independence in basic and instrumental activities in daily living (BADL, IADL), upper extremity motor and functional abilities between individuals with and without proprioception deficits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;102 adults aged 29–85 years with chronic stroke participated in this cross sectional study. The upper extremity was assessed for proprioception (Thumb localization Test), motor [Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA)] and functional ability [Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block Test (BBT)], grip strength and daily use [Motor Activity Log (MAL)]. Independence in BADL and IADL was also assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;71 participants had intact proprioception, 31 participants had mild-moderate proprioception deficits. Negative significant (p&amp;lt;.001) correlations were found between the severity of proprioception deficits to the motor ability (FMA) (r = -.41), functional ability (ARAT) (r = -.48), dexterity (BBT) (r = -.43), grip strength (r = -.41) and daily-use (MAL amount and quality) (r = -.55 and r = -.54, respectively) of the affected upper extremity. Significant between-group differences were found for BADL, IADL and upper extremity measures.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Proprioception deficits of individuals with chronic stroke are negatively associated with upper extremity motor and functional abilities and independence in daily living.

Therefore, proprioception should be assessed at the chronic stage post-stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522443600000</published><title>Proprioception deficits in chronic stroke—Upper extremity function and daily living</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23231-7</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23231-7</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/yJe-9adqV6o/s41598-018-23231-7</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Embodiment in a Child-Like Talking Virtual Body Influences Object Size Perception, Self-Identification, and Subsequent Real Speaking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Embodiment in a Child-Like Talking Virtual Body Influences Object Size Perception, Self-Identification, and Subsequent Real Speaking, Published online: 14 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23231-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23231-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Embodiment in a Child-Like Talking Virtual Body Influences Object Size Perception, Self-Identification, and Subsequent Real Speaking&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/yJe-9adqV6o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>Ana Tajadura-Jiménez</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23231-7</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1622396e80d:11817f:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521015515149</crawled><fingerprint>794a923c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Embodiment in a Child-Like Talking Virtual Body Influences Object Size Perception, Self-Identification, and Subsequent Real Speaking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Embodiment in a Child-Like Talking Virtual Body Influences Object Size Perception, Self-Identification, and Subsequent Real Speaking, Published online: 14 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23231-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23231-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Embodiment in a Child-Like Talking Virtual Body Influences Object Size Perception, Self-Identification, and Subsequent Real Speaking&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/yJe-9adqV6o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1521010800000</published><title>Author Correction: Embodiment in a Child-Like Talking Virtual Body Influences Object Size Perception, Self-Identification, and Subsequent Real Speaking</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by He Luo, Zhengzheng Liang, Moning Zhu, Xiaoxuan Hu, Guoqiang Wang&lt;/p&gt;
Wind has a significant effect on the control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), resulting in changes in their ground speed and direction, which has an important influence on the results of integrated optimization of UAV task allocation and path planning. The objective of this integrated optimization problem changes from minimizing flight distance to minimizing flight time. In this study, the Euclidean distance between any two targets is expanded to the Dubins path length, considering the minimum turning radius of fixed-wing UAVs. According to the vector relationship between wind speed, UAV airspeed, and UAV ground speed, a method is proposed to calculate the flight time of UAV between targets. On this basis, a variable-speed Dubins path vehicle routing problem (VS-DP-VRP) model is established with the purpose of minimizing the time required for UAVs to visit all the targets and return to the starting point.

Compensatory growth (CG), an accelerated growth phenomenon which occurs following a period of dietary restriction is utilised worldwide in animal production systems as a management practise to lower feed costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of jejunal epithelial to CG in cattle through transcriptional profiling following a period of dietary restriction as well as subsequent re-alimentation induced CG. Sixty Holstein Friesian bulls were separated into two groups; RES and ADLIB, with 30 animals in each. RES animals were offered a restricted diet for 125 days (Period 1) followed by &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; feeding for 55 days (Period 2). ADLIB animals had &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; access to feed across both periods 1 and 2. At the end of each period, 15 animals from each treatment group were slaughtered, jejunal epithelium collected and RNAseq analysis performed. Animals that were previously diet restricted underwent CG, gaining 1.8 times the rate of their non-restricted counterparts. Twenty-four genes were differentially expressed in RES compared to ADLIB animals at the end of Period 1, with only one gene, &lt;i&gt;GSTA1&lt;/i&gt;, differentially expressed between the two groups at the end of Period 2. When analysed within treatment (RES, Period 2 v Period 1), 31 genes were differentially expressed between diet restricted and animals undergoing CG. Dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation were associated with altered expression of genes involved in digestion and metabolism as well as those involved in cellular division and growth. Compensatory growth was also associated with greater expression of genes involved in cellular protection and detoxification in jejunal epithelium. This study highlights some of the molecular mechanisms regulating the response to dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation induced CG in cattle; however the gene expression results suggest that most of the CG in jejunal epithelium had occurred by day 55 of re-alimentation.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Kate Keogh</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194445</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fb:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>5dbf6264</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kate Keogh, Sinead M.

Meta-research is the study of research itself: its methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives. Given that science is the key driver of human progress, improving the efficiency of scientific investigation and yielding more credible and more useful research results can translate to major benefits. The research enterprise grows very fast. Both new opportunities for knowledge and innovation and new threats to validity and scientific integrity emerge. Old biases abound, and new ones continuously appear as novel disciplines emerge with different standards and challenges. Meta-research uses an interdisciplinary approach to study, promote, and defend robust science.

Our study addresses how environmental variables, such as macronutrients concentrations, snow cover, carbonate chemistry and salinity affect the photophysiology and biomass of Antarctic sea-ice algae. We have measured vertical profiles of inorganic macronutrients (phosphate, nitrite + nitrate and silicic acid) in summer sea ice and photophysiology of ice algal assemblages in the poorly studied Amundsen and Ross Seas sectors of the Southern Ocean. Brine-scaled bacterial abundance, chl &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and macronutrient concentrations were often high in the ice and positively correlated with each other. Analysis of photosystem II rapid light curves showed that microalgal cells in samples with high phosphate and nitrite + nitrate concentrations had reduced maximum relative electron transport rate and photosynthetic efficiency. We also observed strong couplings of PSII parameters to snow depth, ice thickness and brine salinity, which highlights a wide range of photoacclimation in Antarctic pack-ice algae. It is likely that the pack ice was in a post-bloom situation during the late sea-ice season, with low photosynthetic efficiency and a high degree of nutrient accumulation occurring in the ice. In order to predict how key biogeochemical processes are affected by future changes in sea ice cover, such as &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; photosynthesis and nutrient cycling, we need to understand how physicochemical properties of sea ice affect the microbial community. Our results support existing hypothesis about sea-ice algal photophysiology, and provide additional observations on high nutrient concentrations in sea ice that could influence the planktonic communities as the ice is retreating.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Anders Torstensson</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195587</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b5:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>7b493645</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anders Torstensson, Agneta Fransson, Kim Currie, Angela Wulff, Melissa Chierici&lt;/p&gt;

The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in The Netherlands in 2006 and was replaced by PHiD-CV10 in 2011. Data on carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children &amp;lt;5years and adults &gt;65 years (2004–2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases).

The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in The Netherlands in 2006 and was replaced by PHiD-CV10 in 2011. Data on carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children &amp;lt;5years and adults &gt;65 years (2004–2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases). Serotypes 6C, 23B and 11A have high carriage prevalence in children, but show low invasive disease potential. Serotype 8 is the main causative agent for IPD in older adults (11.3%). In conclusion, 10 years after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children in The Netherlands shifts in carriage and disease serotypes are still ongoing. Surveillance of both carriage and IPD is important to assess PCV impact and to predict necessary future vaccination strategies in both children and older adults.</description><published>1522443600000</published><title>Increased carriage of non-vaccine serotypes with low invasive disease potential four years after switching to the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in The Netherlands</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3617.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3617.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3617.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Speakers implicitly learn novel phonotactic patterns by producing strings of syllables.

We performed a genome-wide analysis and identified SLAC/SLAH gene family members in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) and four other species of Rosaceae (Malus domestica, Prunus persica, Fragaria vesca and Prunus mume). A total of 21 SLAC/SLAH genes were identified from the five Rosaceae species. Based on the structural characteristics and a phylogenetic analysis of these genes, the SLAC/SLAH gene family could be classified into three main groups (I, II and III). The evolutionary analysis showed that the SLAC/SLAH gene family was comparatively conserved during the evolution of Rosaceae species. Transcriptome data demonstrated that PbrSLAC/SLAH genes were detected in all parts of the pear. However, PbrSL AC1 showed a higher expression level in leaf, while PbrSLAH2/3 was mainly expressed in roots. In addition, PbrSLAC/SLAH genes were only located on the plasma membrane in transient expression experiments in Arabidopsis protoplasts cells.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In 2009, China officially launched the New Health Care Reform (NHCR). One important purpose of the reform was to reduce financial burden of health care through health insurance expansion and health care provider regulations. This study aimed to provide evidence on the effect of the NHCR reform on catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) by comparing the occurrence and inequality of CHE among households with chronic diseases patients before and after the reform.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study used the subset of data from the 2008 and 2013 National Health Services Survey conducted in Shaanxi Province. Our sample included households with chronic diseases patients and excluded observations with key variables missing. The final sample size was 1942 households in 2008 and 7704 households in 2013. We defined CHE occurrence following the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO). The income-related inequality in CHE was measured by the concentration index. A multi-level logistic regression model was used in the study to explore the influence of the NHCR on CHE occurrence, controlling for important covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2008 to 2013, the occurrence rate of CHE in rural areas declined from 29.15% to 23.62%. However, the CHE rate in urban areas increased from 19.18% to 24.95%. The interaction term between year and rural/urban location was statistically significant, confirming that the influence of the NHCR on the CHE occurrence rates were heterogeneous between rural and urban areas. As for the CHE inequality, the concentration index in rural areas decreased from -0.4572 to -0.5499 with a p-value less than 0.05. This implied that the CHE occurrence inequality was increased after the implementation of the NHCR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study suggested that the implementation of the NHCR might not have been effective in reducing the CHE occurrence for households with chronic disease patients. Although the occurrence of CHE of rural households had decreased, the occurrence of CHE in urban areas was higher than before. In addition, the income inequality of CHE occurrence was greater in 2013 compared to that in 2008 in rural areas. Although the reform resulted in higher insurance coverage and higher government expenditure in health care, the financial burden of health care on households did not necessarily improve.

Drones are being increasingly used in innovative ways to enhance environmental research and conservation. Despite their widespread use for wildlife studies, there are few scientifically justified guidelines that provide minimum distances at which wildlife can be approached to minimize visual and auditory disturbance. These distances are essential to ensure that behavioral and survey data have no observer bias and form the basis of requirements for animal ethics and scientific permit approvals. In the present study, we documented the behaviors of three species of sea turtle (green turtles, &lt;i&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/i&gt;, flatback turtles, &lt;i&gt;Natator depressus&lt;/i&gt;, hawksbill turtles, &lt;i&gt;Eretmochelys imbricata&lt;/i&gt;), saltwater crocodiles (&lt;i&gt;Crocodylus porosus)&lt;/i&gt;, and crested terns (&lt;i&gt;Thalasseus bergii&lt;/i&gt;) in response to a small commercially available (1.4 kg) multirotor drone flown in Northern Territory and Western Australia. Sea turtles in nearshore waters off nesting beaches or in foraging habitats exhibited no evasive behaviors (e.g. rapid diving) in response to the drone at or above 20–30 m altitude, and at or above 10 m altitude for juvenile green and hawksbill turtles foraging on shallow, algae-covered reefs. Adult female flatback sea turtles were not deterred by drones flying forward or stationary at 10 m altitude when crawling up the beach to nest or digging a body pit or egg chamber. In contrast, flyovers elicited a range of behaviors from crocodiles, including minor, lateral head movements, fleeing, or complete submergence when a drone was present below 50 m altitude. Similarly, a colony of crested terns resting on a sand-bank displayed disturbance behaviors (e.g. flight response) when a drone was flown below 60 m altitude. The current study demonstrates a variety of behavioral disturbance thresholds for diverse species and should be considered when establishing operating conditions for drones in behavioral and conservation studies.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Elizabeth Bevan</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194460</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087ea:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><fingerprint>fe047054</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth Bevan, Scott Whiting, Tony Tucker, Michael Guinea, Andrew Raith, Ryan Douglas&lt;/p&gt;

Sphingolipids are a diverse group of lipids with important roles in beta-cell biology regulating insulin folding and controlling apoptosis. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins with the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA. Here we tested the effect of L-serine supplementation on autoimmune diabetes development and blood glucose homeostasis in female NOD mice. We found that continuous supplementation of L-serine reduces diabetes incidence and insulitis score. In addition, L-serine treated mice had an improved glucose tolerance test, reduced HOMA-IR, and reduced blood glucose levels. L-serine led to a small reduction in body weight accompanied by reduced food and water intake. L-serine had no effect on pancreatic sphingolipids as measured by mass spectrometry. The data thus suggests that L-serine could be used as a therapeutic supplement in the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes and to improve blood glucose homeostasis.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Laurits J.

The IL-1 cytokine family includes eleven members, among which Il-36α, β and γ, IL-36Ra and IL-38. The IL-36 cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-38 is also expressed in the skin and was previously proposed to act as an IL-36 antagonist. In this study, we thus examined expression and function of Il-38 in a mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin inflammation. &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA was detected in the epidermis and in primary mouse keratinocytes, but not in dermal fibroblasts. At the peak of IMQ-induced inflammation, skin &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels were reduced, whereas &lt;i&gt;Il-36ra&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression increased. The severity of IMQ-induced skin inflammation, as assessed by recording ear thickness and histological changes, was similar in Il-38 KO and WT littermate control mice, while, in contrast, Il-36ra-deficient mice displayed more severe skin pathology than their WT littermates. Il-38-deficiency had no impact on IMQ-induced expression of proinflammatory mediators in the skin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, on the basal expression of various cytokines or chemokines by cultured primary keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, or on the response of these cells to Il-36β. Finally, after cessation of topical IMQ application, the resolution of skin inflammation was also not altered in Il-38 KO mice. In conclusion, Il-38-deficiency did not impact the development or resolution of IMQ-induced skin inflammation. Our observations further suggest that endogenous Il-38 does not exert Il-36 inhibitory activity in this model, or in cultured skin cells. A potential anti-inflammatory function of Il-38 in mouse skin thus still remains to be demonstrated.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Jennifer Palomo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194667</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f8904:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>4d0ec072</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Palomo, Sabina Troccaz, Dominique Talabot-Ayer, Emiliana Rodriguez, Gaby Palmer&lt;/p&gt;

Such separations, especially the removal of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from methane, are of great technological relevance in the context of the “upgrade” of natural gas, landfill gas, and biogas. While more than 50 zeolite frameworks have been synthesised in aluminophosphate composition or as heteroatom substituted AlPO derivatives, only a few of them have been characterised experimentally with regard to their adsorption and separation behaviour. In order to predict the potential of a variety of AlPO frameworks for applications in CO2/CH4 and CH4/N2 separations, atomistic grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were performed for 53 different structures. Building on previous work, which studied CO2/N2 mixture adsorption in AlPOs (M. Fischer, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2017, 19, 22801–22812), force field parameters for methane adsorption in AlPOs were validated through a comparison to available experimental adsorption data. Afterwards, CO2/CH4 and CH4/N2 mixture isotherms were computed for all 53 frameworks for room temperature and total pressures up to 1000 kPa (10 bar), allowing the prediction of selectivities and working capacities for conditions that are relevant for pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and vacuum swing adsorption (VSA). For CO2/CH4 mixtures, the GIS, SIV, and ATT frameworks were found to have the highest selectivities and CO2 working capacities under VSA conditions, whereas several frameworks, among them AFY, KFI, AEI, and LTA, show higher working capacities under PSA conditions. For CH4/N2 mixtures, all frameworks are moderately selective for methane over nitrogen, with ATV exhibiting a significantly higher selectivity than all other frameworks. While some of the most promising topologies are either not available in pure-AlPO4 composition or collapse upon calcination, others can be synthesised and activated, rendering them interesting candidates for future experimental studies. In addition to predictions of mixture adsorption isotherms, further simulations were performed for four selected systems in order to investigate the microscopic origins of the macroscopic adsorption behaviour, e.g. with regard to the very high CH4/N2 selectivity of ATV and the loading-dependent evolution of the heat of CO2 adsorption and CO2/CH4 selectivity of AEI and GME.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Aluminophosphates with zeolite-like topologies (AlPOs) have received considerable attention as potential adsorbents for use in the separation of methane-containing gas mixtures.

However, mass collection of such sensitive data entails enormous risks if not protected to the highest standards. In this article, we follow the position and argue that post-alignment privacy is not enough and that data should be automatically protected as early as possible in the genomics workflow, ideally immediately after the data is produced. We show that a previous approach for filtering short reads cannot extend to long reads and present a novel filtering approach that classifies raw genomic data (i.e., whose location and content is not yet determined) into privacy-sensitive (i.e., more affected by a successful privacy attack) and non-privacy-sensitive information.

However, mass collection of such sensitive data entails enormous risks if not protected to the highest standards. In this article, we follow the position and argue that post-alignment privacy is not enough and that data should be automatically protected as early as possible in the genomics workflow, ideally immediately after the data is produced. We show that a previous approach for filtering short reads cannot extend to long reads and present a novel filtering approach that classifies raw genomic data (i.e., whose location and content is not yet determined) into privacy-sensitive (i.e., more affected by a successful privacy attack) and non-privacy-sensitive information. Such a classification allows the fine-grained and automated adjustment of protective measures to mitigate the possible consequences of exposure, in particular when relying on public clouds. We present the first filter that can be indistinctly applied to reads of any length, i.e., making it usable with any recent or future sequencing technologies. The filter is accurate, in the sense that it detects all known sensitive nucleotides except those located in highly variable regions (less than 10 nucleotides remain undetected per genome instead of 100,000 in previous works).

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study was aimed at a serial evaluation and comparison of the prognostic values of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores for neurologic outcomes in comatose, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors, treated with targeted temperature management (TTM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analysed a prospective cohort of comatose OHCA patients, with TTM, admitted to an emergency intensive care unit (ICU), between January 2010 and December 2015. SOFA and APACHE II scores were calculated initially, and then at day 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after ICU admission. Primary and secondary outcomes were the 28-day neurologic outcome and the 28-day mortality, respectively. Prognostic value of the SOFA and APACHE II scores was analysed using the receiver operating characteristic curve.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 143 selected patients, 62 survived and 34 had good neurologic outcomes at day 28. There was no significant difference in the SOFA and extracerebral SOFA scores between the good and poor neurologic outcome groups. However, the APACHE II scores were significantly higher in the good outcome group; they displayed good discriminatory power in predicting poor outcomes, unlike the SOFA scores. The APACHE II score at day 3 had the highest prognostic value for predicting poor neurologic outcomes with an area under the cure of 0.793, and with a cut-off value of 20, the APACHE II score predicted poor neurologic outcomes with a sensitivity of 43.75%, a specificity of 94.12%, a positive predictive value of 94.59%, and a negative predictive value of 41.56%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Identifying APACHE II score might assist as one piece of multimodal prognostic approach for the assessment of neurologic outcomes in OHCA survivors treated with TTM.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Jae Chol Yoon</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195628</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d749:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>5d87e8eb</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jae Chol Yoon, Youn-Jung Kim, You-Jin Lee, Seung Mok Ryoo, Chang Hwan Sohn, Dong-Woo Seo, Yoon-Seon Lee, Jae Ho Lee, Kyoung Soo Lim, Won Young Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Despite its public availability, a majority of this data remains hard to query to the research community due to a lack of efficient data representation and indexing solutions. One of the available techniques to represent read data is a condensed form as an assembly graph. Such a representation contains all sequence information but does not store contextual information and metadata. We present two new approaches for a compressed representation of a graph coloring: a lossless compression scheme based on a novel application of wavelet tries as well as a highly accurate lossy compression based on a set of Bloom filters. Both strategies retain a coloring with dynamically changing graph topology. We present construction and merge procedures for both methods and evaluate their performance on a wide range of different datasets. By dropping the requirement of a fully lossless compression and using the topological information of the underlying graph, we can reduce memory requirements by up to three orders of magnitude. Representing individual colors as independently stored modules, our approaches are fully dynamic and can be efficiently parallelized. These properties allow for an easy upscaling to the problem sizes common to the biomedical domain.

Despite its public availability, a majority of this data remains hard to query to the research community due to a lack of efficient data representation and indexing solutions.

Studies conducted during the past few years have confirmed active West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in Serbia. Based on these studies and the epidemiological situation, the Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection launched national WNV surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015. The programmes encompassed the territory of Serbia and were conducted by the veterinary service in collaboration with entomologists and ornithologists. The objective of the programmes was early detection of WNV and timely reporting to the public health service and local authorities to increase both clinical and mosquito control preparedness. The WNV surveillance programmes were based on direct and indirect surveillance of the presence of WNV by the serological testing of initially seronegative sentinel horses and chickens as well as through viral detection in pooled mosquito and wild bird samples. The most intense WNV circulation was observed in all seven districts of Vojvodina Province (northern Serbia) and Belgrade City, where most of the positive samples were detected among sentinel animals, mosquitoes and wild birds. The West Nile virus surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015 showed satisfactory results in their capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for humans and their sensitivity to early detect viral circulation at the enzootic level. Most of the human cases were preceded by the detection of WNV circulation as part of the surveillance programmes. According to the existing data, it can be reasonably assumed that WNV infection, now an endemic infection in Serbia, will continue to present a significant problem for the veterinary service and public health.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Tamaš Petrović</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195439</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd079:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>f4d07f1d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tamaš Petrović, Milanko Šekler, Dušan Petrić, Sava Lazić, Zoran Debeljak, Dejan Vidanović, Aleksandra Ignjatović Ćupina, Gospava Lazić, Diana Lupulović, Mišo Kolarević, Budimir Plavšić&lt;/p&gt;

Analyzing extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an attractive approach to diagnosis of prostate diagnosis. However, existing methods of EVs isolation have low efficiency, purity, and long process time, and therefore have low diagnostic ability. To solve these the problems, a two-phase system is adapted to isolate EVs from a patient’s urine. Urine from 20 prostate cancer (PCA) patients and 10 benign prostate hyperplasia patients was used to quantify the EVs-isolation ability of an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) and to compare the diagnostic ability of ATPS with that of the conventional diagnosis method. An optimized ATPS isolates EVs with ~100% efficiency within ~30 min, with 14 times as high as achieved by ultracentrifugation. Afterward, PCR and ELISA are used to detect EVs derived from PCA cells in urine. The results demonstrate that diagnostic ability based on ATPS is better than other conventional diagnostic methods. ATPS can obtain a high quality and quantity of EVs from patients’ urine. EVs contain cancer-related protein and genes, so these abundant sources enable diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, ATPS is a useful tool to increase the specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Hyunwoo Shin</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194818</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f0f:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>43d40a2f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunwoo Shin, Yong Hyun Park, Yong-Goo Kim, Ji Youl Lee, Jaesung Park&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. are a leading cause of bacterial enteritis worldwide, including countries in Africa, and have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of the high priority antimicrobial resistant pathogens. However, at present there is little knowledge on the prevalence, molecular epidemiology or antimicrobial susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolates in Botswana, both in patients and in the zoonotic context. Some data indicate that ~14% of diarrhoeal disease cases in a paediatric setting can be ascribed to &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp., urging the need for the magnitude of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt;-associated diarrhoea to be established. In this survey, we have characterised the genomic diversity of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. circulating in Botswana isolated from cases of diarrhoeal disease in humans (n = 20) and from those that colonised commercial broiler (n = 35) and free-range (n = 35) chickens. Phylogeny showed that the &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from the different poultry and human sources were highly related, suggesting that zoonotic transmission has likely occurred. We found that for &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from humans, broilers and free-range chickens, 52% was positive for &lt;i&gt;tetO&lt;/i&gt;, 47% for &lt;i&gt;gyrA&lt;/i&gt;-T86I, 72% for &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA-61&lt;/sub&gt;, with 27% carrying all three resistance determinants.

The authors are going over a number of areas where medicinal chemistry could make use of more advanced synthetic techniques, and they’re good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, “&lt;em&gt;From an industry perspective, the most common challenge for any new synthetic method is its level of tolerance to the polar functional groups and nitrogen heteroatoms found in biologically active molecules.&lt;/em&gt;” Yes indeed. That’s what I look at when I see a neat new transformation in the literature – what did it work on? Basic amines OK? Tertiary or secondary? Secondary amides tolerated? Carboxylic acids? Free OH groups? I’m disappointed sometimes when I find that a reaction can’t tolerate these, but I’m glad that the papers involved at least went to the trouble of finding the limits to their chemistry. Far worse than that is a paper that tiptoes around the issues of chemical compatibility, leaving you to find out for yourself – if you’re so inclined, and often one is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area identified is late-stage functionalization, C-H bond activation, etc. Those reactions are always welcome, for sure. Chemical diversity is one of the names of the game that we play, and anything that allows us to get more of it quickly and reliably is good news. Blending with the above, the more complex and functionalized the molecules that can be used as substrates for such chemistry, the better. We’ll take fluorination, hydroxylation, amination, addition of methoxy, trifluoromethyl, what have you. It’s great to be able to predict where the functionalization will happen, of course, but there’s value in things that just sort of go in and mess with structures, too: new molecules! After all, that’s what the liver enzymes do to our drugs; we’re used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also calls for new ways to synthesize and functionalize small heterocyclic rings, new metal-catalyzed coupling reactions (and new C-C bond-forming reactions in general), more biomolecule-compatible reactions, and more. It also goes briefly into machine-assisted synthesis and software-assisted retrosynthesis, but the bulk of the paper is on synthetic methods, and I can only cheer on their suggestions. These are all potential areas for academic-industrial collaboration to generate new chemistry, because everyone benefits from success in these areas (indeed, some of this collaboration goes on already for just these reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I enjoyed this paper very much, but it starts off with a claim that’s worth arguing about: “&lt;em&gt;organic synthesis is still a rate-limiting factor in drug-discovery projects&lt;/em&gt;“. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on where you’re standing. All the synthetic limitations described above are real, and they keep us from being able to make a lot of molecules that we’d otherwise be cranking out. But (and this is a big point) it’s rarely the case that we medicinal chemists identify a tricky new structure that absolutely has to be made. That sounds odd, but it comes down to our predictive powers, which aren’t so great. We don’t generally draw some wild compound up on the hood sash and say “That’s the one, folks: find a way to make it or die trying”. We never know which is the one, so in the absence of knowing, we make the things that we can make in the ways that we can make them, and honestly, much of the time, we can manage to come up with something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, though, things like the ability to make more polar compounds reliably and quickly would probably lead to better and more structurally diverse drug candidates and screening compounds, not to mention better starting points for projects in general. We just don’t know which ones. The main examples of specific compounds I can think of are metabolites or potential metabolites, where the liver has made some new polar compound out of an existing drug candidate, and we need to make the new compound(s) for testing. Those can be tough, and sometimes the only way is to grind out small quantities by exposing the drug to liver tissue itself (!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for times we can’t come up with something, I would like to believe that far more diverse and interesting sets of compounds, millions of them, would allow for real hits to be found against target classes that we currently have trouble attacking. But that remains to be proven, if it ever can be. Chemical space is so large that you can always say “Well, your compound set still wasn’t big enough – the good ones are still out there”, and there’s no way to say that’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the real killers in drug discovery stem from – to put it mildly – our incomplete understanding of biology. It’s Phase II and Phase III failures that hammer us, and those happen because we don’t understand our desirable (and undesirable) mechanisms of action enough, leading to failures in efficacy and safety. Even worse, they come after a big pile of money has been spent. Compared to these problems, generating chemical matter is not as big a concern. We already generate enough chemical matter to send all sorts of stuff into the clinic, where 80 to 90% of it dies for other reasons entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic chemistry is, of course, crucial to making small-molecule drugs, and you’d think that would be enough. But as a chemist, I wish that organic synthesis were more relevant to these deep problems. But in the big picture, it isn’t quite so. Chemical biology, as a field, is an attempt to make that happen, but How to Make will never be able to answer questions of What to Make and Why.&lt;/p&gt;

During the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century the discussion on early human behavioral patterns revolved around the &lt;i&gt;hunting versus scavenging&lt;/i&gt; debate. The correct identification of bone modifications, including percussion, cut and tooth marks, is a key issue within this debate. While many authors have shown that carnivore and human modifications can be easily distinguished, it is true that sometimes percussion marks without associated microstriations and tooth pits overlap morphologically, causing confusion, especially when unmodified hammerstones are used. In order to solve this equifinality problem, many investigations have focused their efforts on other pieces of evidence such as the identification of notches, fragmentation patterns and frequencies, among others. These studies, however, cannot be considered as fully conclusive. Within this paper we address the problem of equifinality when identifying percussion marks produced with unmodified hammerstones and tooth pits created by carnivores using new methodologies based on the 3D reconstruction of marks and their statistical multivariate analysis. For the purpose of this study a total of 128 marks– 39 percussion marks produced with an unmodified quartzite hammerstone, and 89 pits generated by different carnivores–were virtually modelled with the aid of a DAVID structured-light scanner SLS-2 and later analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. Our results show that percussion marks not associated with striae fields and the pits generated by the carnivores studied here can be successfully distinguished.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>José Yravedra</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194324</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2819:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>a2c9073e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by José Yravedra, Julia Aramendi, Miguel Ángel Maté-González, Lloyd Austin Courtenay, Diego González-Aguilera&lt;/p&gt;

Although personality traits can largely affect individual fitness we know little about the evolutionary forces generating and maintaining personality variation. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that personality variation in aggression is sexually selected in the monogamous, bi-parental cichlid &lt;i&gt;Pelvicachromis pulcher&lt;/i&gt;. In this species, breeding pairs form territories and they aggressively defend their territory and offspring against con- and heterospecific intruders. In our mate choice study, we followed up two alternative hypotheses. We either expected females to show a directional preference for a high level and high consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for male parental quality). Alternatively, we expected females to choose males for (dis-)similarity in the level/consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for compatibility). Individual level and consistency of aggression were assessed for males and females using mirror tests. After eavesdropping on aggressive behaviour of two males (differing in level and consistency of aggression) females were then allowed to choose between the two males. Males, but not females, showed personality variation in aggression. Further, females generally preferred consistent over inconsistent males independent of their level of aggression. We did not detect a general preference for the level of male aggression. However, we found an above average preference for consistent high-aggression males; whereas female preference for inconsistent high-aggression did not deviate from random choice. Our results suggest behavioural consistency of aggression in male rainbow kribs is selected for via female mate choice. Further, our study underlines the importance of considering both the level and the consistency of a behavioural trait in studies of animal behaviour.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Ulrike Scherer</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195766</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c6:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>9fb58851</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ulrike Scherer, Mira Kuhnhardt, Wiebke Schuett&lt;/p&gt;

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease, and survival signatures are urgently needed to better monitor treatment. MiRNAs displayed vital regulatory roles on target genes, which was necessary involved in the complex disease. We therefore examined the expression levels of miRNAs and genes to identify robust signatures for survival benefit analyses. First, we reconstructed subpathway graphs by embedding miRNA components that were derived from low-throughput miRNA-gene interactions. Then, we randomly divided the data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into training and testing sets, and further formed 100 subsets based on the training set. Using each subset, we identified survival-related miRNAs and genes, and identified survival subpathways based on the reconstructed subpathway graphs. After statistical analyses of these survival subpathways, the most robust subpathways with the top three ranks were identified, and risk scores were calculated based on these robust subpathways for AML patient prognoses. Among these robust subpathways, three representative subpathways, path: 05200_10 from Pathways in cancer, path: 04110_20 from Cell cycle, and path: 04510_8 from Focal adhesion, were significantly associated with patient survival in the TCGA training and testing sets based on subpathway risk scores. In conclusion, we performed integrated analyses of miRNAs and genes to identify robust prognostic subpathways, and calculated subpathway risk scores to characterize AML patient survival.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Huijuan Chang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194245</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51c3:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>68f593b2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huijuan Chang, Qiuying Gao, Wei Ding, Xueqin Qing&lt;/p&gt;

Two approaches currently under development in &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes are the two-locus engineered underdominance and killer-rescue gene drive systems. Each of these is theoretically capable of increasing in frequency within a population, thus spreading associated desirable genetic traits. Thus they have gained attention for their potential to aid in the fight against various mosquito-vectored diseases. In the case of engineered underdominance, introduced transgenes are theoretically capable of persisting indefinitely (i.e. it is self-sustaining) whilst in the killer-rescue system the rescue component should initially increase in frequency (while the lethal component (killer) is common) before eventually declining (when the killer is rare) and being eliminated (i.e. it is temporally self-limiting). The population genetics of both systems have been explored using discrete generation mathematical models. The effects of various ecological factors on these two systems have also been considered using alternative modelling methodologies. Here we formulate and analyse new mathematical models combining the population dynamics and population genetics of these two classes of gene drive that incorporate ecological factors not previously studied and are simple enough to allow the effects of each to be disentangled. In particular, we focus on the potential effects that may be obtained as a result of differing ecological factors such as strengths of larval competition; numbers of breeding sites; and the relative fitness of transgenic mosquitoes compared with their wild-type counterparts. We also extend our models to consider population dynamics in two demes in order to explore the effects of dispersal between neighbouring populations on the outcome of UD and KR gene drive systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3QzCHPdoiAg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006059</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006059</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16253fa0281:3c81d8:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521827316353</crawled><fingerprint>b57739f6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew P.

It has been suggested that tactile signals are suppressed on a moving limb to free capacities for processing other relevant sensory signals. In line with this notion, we recently showed that tactile suppression is indeed stronger in the presence of reach-relevant somatosensory signals. Here we examined whether this effect also generalizes to the processing of additional visual signals during reaching. Brief vibrotactile stimuli were presented on the participants’ right index finger either during right-hand reaching to a previously illuminated target LED, or during rest. Participants had to indicate whether they detected the vibrotactile stimulus or not. The target LED remained off (&lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt;), or was briefly illuminated (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt;) during reaching, providing additional reach-relevant visual information about the target position. If tactile suppression frees capacities for &lt;i&gt;reach-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual information, suppression should be stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt; condition. In an additional visual-discrimination condition (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt;), the target LED flashed once or twice during reaching and participants had to also report the number of flashes. If tactile suppression occurs to free additional capacities for &lt;i&gt;perception-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual signals, tactile suppression should be even stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; condition. We found that additional visual signals improved reach endpoint accuracy and precision. In all conditions, reaching led to tactile suppression as indicated by higher detection thresholds compared to rest, confirming previous findings. However, tactile suppression was comparable between conditions arguing against the hypothesis that it frees capacities for processing other relevant visual signals.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Hanna Gertz</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57601:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>ba854dbd</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Gertz, Katja Fiehler, Dimitris Voudouris&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;To examine the accuracy of Rapid Diagnosis of &lt;i&gt;Talaromyces marneffei&lt;/i&gt; (RDTM) in order to improve diagnosis and treatment for clinical measures and reduce the mortality due to associated infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we screened PubMed, Ovid (Cochrane library) and Web of Science, Chinese database CNKI and Wanfang for articles published between 1956 and December, 2017. Data were taken from cross-sectional studies as well as from baseline measurements in longitudinal studies with clinical follow-up. Articles were excluded if they did not contain a cohort with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; and a control cohort or a cohort with standard fungus culture. Data were extracted by two authors and checked by three for accuracy.

The total combined sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnosis of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68–0.90) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98–1.00). According to the experimental method, the included studies can be divided into three subgroups, including PCR-based, ELISA-based and others.

Our approach, broadly applicable to any microbial or other ecological network, can drive the discovery of new interactions and new molecular mechanisms, both for therapeutic interventions involving natural communities and for the rational design of synthetic consortia.</description><published>1521615600000</published><title>Machine learning reveals missing edges and putative interaction mechanisms in microbial ecosystem networks [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32904</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32904</link><crawled>1523359810155</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523318400000</published><author><name>andersen@vis.caltech.edu (Brian Lee)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32904</canonicalUrl><engagement>16</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162af52026b:1c292ea:923c4a60</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32904</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>27fe9746</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><engagementRate>1.14</engagementRate><description>Pioneering work with nonhuman primates and recent human studies established intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) as a method of inducing discriminable artificial sensation.

GDSL lipase (GLIP) plays a pivotal role in plant cell growth as a multifunctional hydrolytic enzyme. Herein, a cotton (&lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; L. cv Xuzhou 142) GDSL lipase gene (&lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;) was obtained from developing ovules and fibers. The &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,143 base pairs (bp) and encodes a putative polypeptide of 380 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment indicated that GhGLIP includes four enzyme catalytic amino acid residue sites of Ser (S), Gly (G), Asn (N) and His (H), located in four conserved blocks. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that GhGLIP belongs to the typical class IV lipase family with potential functions in plant secondary metabolism. Subcellular distribution analysis demonstrated that GhGLIP localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm and plasma membrane. &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; was expressed predominantly at 5–15 day post anthesis (dpa) in developing ovules and elongating fibers, measured as mRNA levels and enzyme activity. Ectopic overexpression of &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; in Arabidopsis plants resulted in enhanced seed development, including length and fresh weight. Meanwhile, there was increased soluble sugar and protein storage in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, coupled with the promotion of lipase activity. Moreover, the expression of cotton &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; is induced by ethylene (ETH) treatment &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. A 1,954-bp &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; promoter was isolated and expressed high activity in driving green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression in tobacco leaves. &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting element analysis of the &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; promoter (&lt;i&gt;pGhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;) indicated the presence of an ethylene-responsive element (ERE), and transgenic tobacco leaves with ectopic expression of &lt;i&gt;pGhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP-GUS&lt;/i&gt; showed increased GUS activity after ETH treatment. In summary, these results suggest that GhGLIP is a functional enzyme involved in ovule and fiber development and performs significant roles in seed development.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Rendi Ma</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195556</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d741:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>66975b42</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rendi Ma, Hali Yuan, Jing An, Xiaoyun Hao, Hongbin Li&lt;/p&gt;

Young women (aged 15–24) who exchange sex for money or other support are among the highest risk groups for HIV acquisition, particularly in high prevalence settings. To prepare for introduction and evaluation of the DREAMS programme in Zimbabwe, which provides biomedical and social interventions to reduce adolescent girls’ and young women’s HIV vulnerability, we conducted a rapid needs assessment in 6 towns using a “social mapping” approach. In each site, we talked to adult sex workers and other key informants to identify locations where young women sell sex, followed by direct observation, group discussions and interviews. We collected data on socio-demographic characteristics of young women who sell sex, the structure and organisation of their sexual exchanges, interactions with each other and adult sex workers, and engagement with health services. Over a two-week period, we developed a “social map” for each study site, identifying similarities and differences across contexts and their implications for programming and research. Similarities include the concentration of younger women in street-based venues in town centres, their conflict with older sex workers due to competition for clients and acceptance of lower payments, and reluctance to attend existing services. Key differences were found in the 4 university towns included in our sample, where female students participate in diverse forms of sexual exchange but do not identify themselves as selling sex. In smaller towns where illegal gold panning or trucking routes were found, young women migrated in from surrounding rural areas specifically to sell sex. Young women who sell sex are different from each other, and do not work with or attend the same services as adult sex workers. Our findings are being used to inform appropriate intervention activities targeting these vulnerable young women, and to identify effective strategies for recruiting them into the DREAMS process and impact evaluations.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Tarisai Chiyaka</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194301</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e15:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>9f37edae</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tarisai Chiyaka, Phillis Mushati, Bernadette Hensen, Sungai Chabata, James R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Although evidence suggests that dopaminergic systems are involved in pain processing, the effects of dopaminergic interventions on pain remains questionable. This randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was aimed at exploring the effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on experimental pain evoked by cold stimulation and on spontaneous pain in patients with lumbar radicular (neuropathic) pain.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data was collected from 35 patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy (18 men, mean age 56.2±13 years).

Background &lt;p&gt;Although evidence suggests that dopaminergic systems are involved in pain processing, the effects of dopaminergic interventions on pain remains questionable. This randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was aimed at exploring the effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on experimental pain evoked by cold stimulation and on spontaneous pain in patients with lumbar radicular (neuropathic) pain.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data was collected from 35 patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy (18 men, mean age 56.2±13 years). The following parameters were evaluated before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 minutes subsequent to a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo: cold pain threshold and tolerance in the painful site (ice pack, affected leg) and in a remote non-painful site (12°C water bath, hand), and spontaneous (affected leg) pain intensity (NPS, 0–100).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and twenty minutes following apomorphine (but not placebo) injection, cold pain threshold and tolerance in the hand increased significantly compared to baseline (from a median of 8.0 seconds (IQR = 5.0) to 10 seconds (IQR = 9.0), p = 0.001 and from a median of 19.5 seconds (IQR = 30.2) to 27.0 seconds (IQR = 37.5), p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively).

The waste of commonly used medicines is known to contaminate freshwater ecosystems. Pharmaceuticals can be toxic, mutagenic, or modifying to freshwater organisms even at low concentrations if consider their permanent presence in the environment. Chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer, and in particular alkylating agents, contribute significantly to this form of pollution, the latter introducing cytotoxic and/or mutagenic lesions to the DNA and RNA of organisms which can be disruptive to their cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide (CP) on &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt; clones. We evaluated the life history parameters and protein profiles of this crustacean following exposure to environmentally relevant CP concentration of 10 ng L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Even at this low concentration, the alkylating agent caused modification of the life history parameters and proteome profile of the &lt;i&gt;Daphnia&lt;/i&gt;. These changes were clone-specific and involved growth rate, age at first reproduction, neonate number, and proteins related to cell cycle and redox state regulation. The disturbance caused by pharmaceuticals contaminating freshwater ecosystem is probably weaker and unlikely to be cytotoxic in character due to the high dilution of these substances in the water. However, our results indicate that prolonged exposure of organisms to these toxins may lead to modifications on the organismal and molecular levels with unpredictable significance for the entire ecosystem.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Małgorzata Grzesiuk</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195366</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4618:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>d431fe05</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Grzesiuk, Damian Mielecki, Tomasz Pilżys, Damian Garbicz, Michał Marcinkowski, Elżbieta Grzesiuk&lt;/p&gt;

Devils Hole is the sole natural habitat of the critically endangered Devils Hole pupfish (&lt;i&gt;Cyprinodon diabolis&lt;/i&gt;). To establish a backup population, the Ash Meadows Fish Conservation Facility (AMFCF), a full-scale replica of the uppermost 6.7 m of Devils Hole, was constructed by management agencies in the mid-2010s. Despite rigorous efforts to mimic the bathymetric and physical details of the Devils Hole environment, the biogeochemistry and microbiology of the AMFCF refuge tank remain largely unaddressed. We evaluated water physicochemistry and employed Illumina DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries to evaluate planktonic and benthic bacterial and archaeal community composition within their respective physicochemical contexts in Devils Hole and AMFCF on the same day. Major ion concentrations were consistent between the two systems, but water temperature and dissolved oxygen dynamics differed. Bioavailable nitrogen (primarily nitrate) was 5x lower in AMFCF. Devils Hole and AMFCF nitrogen:phosphorus molar ratios were 107:1 and 22:1, indicative of different nutrient control mechanisms. Both sites are microbiologically diverse, with over 40 prokaryotic phyla represented at each, with 37 shared between them and nearly than half deriving from candidate divisions. The abundance and composition of predicted photosynthetic primary producers (Cyanobacteria) was markedly different between sites: Devils Hole planktonic and sediment communities were dominated by &lt;i&gt;Oscillatoria spp&lt;/i&gt;. (13.2% mean relative abundance), which proved virtually undetectable in AMFCF. Conversely, AMFCF was dominated by a predicted heterotroph from the Verrucomicrobiaceae family (31.7%); which was comparatively rare (&amp;lt;2.4%) in Devils Hole. We propose that the paucity of bioavailable nitrogen in AMFCF, perhaps resulting from physical isolation from allochthonous environmental inputs, is reflected in the microbial assemblage disparity, influences biogeochemical cycling of other dissolved constituents, and may ultimately impact survivorship and recruitment of refuge populations of the Devils Hole pupfish.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Joshua D.

Tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy are a diverse group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders pathologically defined by inclusions containing aberrantly aggregated, post-translationally modified tau. The tau pathology burden correlates with neurodegeneration and dementia observed in these diseases. The microtubule binding domain of tau is essential for its physiological functions in promoting neuronal cytoskeletal stability, however it is also required for tau to assemble into an amyloid structure that comprises pathological inclusions. A series of novel monoclonal antibodies were generated which recognize the second and fourth microtubule-binding repeat domain of tau, thus enabling the identification specifically of 4-repeat tau versus 3-/4-repeat tau, respectively. These antibodies are highly specific for tau and recognize pathological tau inclusions in human tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and in transgenic mouse models of tauopathies. These new antibodies will be useful for identifying and characterizing different tauopathies and as tools to target tau pathology in these diseases.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Cara L.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved therapy for treatment of epilepsy and depression. While also shown to be promising in several preclinical and clinical studies to treat cardiovascular diseases, optimal therapeutic stimulation paradigms are still under investigation. Traditionally, parameters such as frequency, current, and duty cycle are used to adjust the efficacy of VNS therapy. This study explored the effect of novel stochastic VNS (S-VNS) on acute heart rate (HR) dynamics. The effect of S-VNS was evaluated in Sprague Dawley rats by comparing the acute HR and HR variability (HRV) responses to standard, periodic VNS (P-VNS) across different frequencies (FREQs, 10–30 Hz). Our results demonstrate that both S-VNS and P-VNS produced negative chronotropic effects in a FREQ-dependent manner with S-VNS inducing a significantly smaller drop in HR at 10 Hz and 20 Hz compared to P-VNS (p&amp;lt;0.05). S-VNS demonstrated a FREQ-dependent drop in the SD1/SD2 ratio, a measure of HRV, which was absent in P-VNS, suggesting that S-VNS may acutely modulate the nonlinear relationship between short- and long-term HRV. In conclusion, S-VNS is a novel stimulation procedure that may provide different physiological outcomes from standard P-VNS, as indicated by our analysis of HR dynamics. Our study provides a rationale for further detailed investigations into the therapeutic potential of S-VNS as a novel neuromodulation technique.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Steven W.

The present study aimed to explore how state self-control influences the intertemporal decisions made by individuals with high and low trait self-control. State self-control, represented by the degree of depletion, was manipulated by conducting Stroop tasks with different levels of difficulty, and the intertemporal decision task was used as a self-control task. Compared with participants with high trait self-control, the preferences of participants with low trait self-control for immediate rewards were more vulnerable to the difficulty of depletion tasks. Throughout the experimental stages, the heart rate variability (HRV) of participants with high trait self-control was significantly higher than that of participants with low trait self-control, indicating that individuals with high trait self-control may have stronger and more stable self-control abilities.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Yuan Guan</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195333</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f69:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>a0e64413</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Guan, Jiamei He&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the retention and discontinuation reasons of seven biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in a real-world setting of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 1,037 treatment courses with bDMARDs from 2009 to 2016 [female, 81.8%; baseline age, 59.6 y; disease duration 7.8 y; rheumatoid factor positivity 81.5%; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), 4.4; concomitant prednisolone 43.5% and methotrexate 68.6%; Bio-naïve, 57.1%; abatacept (ABT), 21.3%; tocilizumab (TCZ), 20.7%; golimumab (GLM), 16.9%; etanercept (ETN), 13.6%; adalimumab (ADA), 11.1%; infliximab (IFX), 8.5%; certolizumab pegol (CZP), 7.9%] were included in this multi-center, retrospective study. Drug retention and discontinuation reasons at 36 months were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and adjusted by potent confounders using Cox proportional hazards modeling. As a result, 455 treatment courses (43.9%) were stopped, with 217 (20.9%) stopping due to inefficacy, 113 (10.9%) due to non-toxic reasons, 86 (8.3%) due to toxic adverse events, and 39 (3.8%) due to remission. Drug retention rates in the adjusted model were as follows: total retention (ABT, 60.7%; ADA, 32.7%; CZP, 43.3%; ETN, 51.9%; GLM, 45.4%; IFX, 31.1%; and TCZ, 59.2%; P &amp;lt; 0.001); inefficacy (ABT, 81.4%; ADA, 65.7%; CZP, 60.7%; ETN, 71.3%; GLM, 68.5%; IFX, 65.0%; and TCZ, 81.4%; P = 0.015), toxic adverse events (ABT, 89.8%; ADA, 80.5%; CZP, 83.9%; ETN, 89.2%; GLM, 85.5%; IFX, 75.6%; and TCZ, 77.2%; P = 0.50), and remission (ABT, 95.5%; ADA, 88.1%; CZP, 91.1%; ETN, 97.5%; GLM, 94.7%; IFX, 86.4%; and TCZ, 98.4%; P &amp;lt; 0.001).

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) have always represented a public health concern in the military, yet most studies rely on self-reports among non-random samples of military populations. In addition, most of the studies exploring STI rates among the military focus on US service members. This paper assesses the prevalence and correlates of STIs in the French military using biomarkers and compares self-reported versus diagnosed STIs.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data are drawn from the COSEMIL study, a national sexual health survey conducted in the French military in 2014 and 2015. A random sample of 784 men and 141 women aged 18–57 years completed a self-administered questionnaire and provided biological samples for STI testing. We used logistic regression modeling to identify the correlates of STI diagnosis and self-reports.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of diagnosed STIs was 4.7% [3.8–5.9], mostly due to &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt;. This rate was four times higher than the 12 months self-reported rate of 1.1% [0.6–2.3]. Reported STI rates were similar among men and women (1.1% &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 1.8%), but diagnosed STI rates were twice as high among females &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; males (10.4% &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 4.1%, p = 0.007). There were significant differences in the determinants of reported &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; diagnosed STIs. In particular, age and sexual orientation were associated with reported STIs, but not with diagnosed STIs. Conversely, STI counseling and depression were associated with STI diagnosis but not with STI reports.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study underlines the need to use biomarkers in population-based surveys, given the differential and substantial underreporting of STIs. Results also highlight the need for programmatic adaptation to address gender inequalities in STI rates, by developing women’s health services in the French military. Addressing such needs not only benefits women but could also serve as a strategy to reduce overall STI rates as most military women have military partners, increasing the risk of internal transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Sandrine Duron</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195158</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76924:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>2a3d4dc5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sandrine Duron, Henri Panjo, Aline Bohet, Christine Bigaillon, Sébastien Sicard, Nathalie Bajos, Jean-Baptiste Meynard, Audrey Mérens, Caroline Moreau&lt;/p&gt;

That, put simply, is a different crystalline form, and any given substance can have several. Or a lot more than several. I don’t know what the record is for any single compound, but it’s way up into the dozens, and you never know when a new one might show up. You can get these different forms through all sorts of variations in the way the compound is crystallized or precipitated: different solvents, different temperatures, different types of stirring (yes indeed), different concentrations. . .and we haven’t even gotten to hydrates and solvates, where molecules of water or other solvents are incorporated into the crystal structure as it forms. And &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; can have polymorphs in turn, or different ratios of water and solvent, and there’s just no end to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymorphs can behave completely differently from each other. The same substance, completely pure, can come out looking like several unmistakable crystal types (rods, prisms, plates), in different crystalline space groups, with completely different melting points and solubility behavior. Past blog posts on this are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/10/22/phenylalanine_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/08/25/polymorphs_and_salts_india_raises_an_eyebrow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2011/01/12/gassing_your_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/04/01/novartis_loses_the_glivec_patent_fight_in_india&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and as that last one illustrates, this is definitely not something of just theoretical interest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=17333&quot;&gt;The saga&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-HIV drug Ritonavir is the classic example. That altered solubility behavior is of tremendous importance for drug dosing, and in Ritonavir’s case, a more stable (and less desirable!) polymorph appeared and threatened to disrupt the entire supply of the drug, because after a while, it was appearing more and more in the production line. “More stable”, of course, can easily mean “so stable it would rather not dissolve and get into the bloodstream”. Polymorphs themselves can be patented separately over such meaningful differences, as can methods for their production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even very simple compounds can show grindingly complex behavior. Aspirin, for example, exists in two polymorphs (so far) that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.200603373&quot;&gt;so similar&lt;/a&gt; that they can both show up &lt;em&gt;in the same single crystal&lt;/em&gt;, and it takes good X-ray data (and a good X-ray crystallographer) to work out what’s going on. One of those past blog post links is about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/blog/post-42/&quot;&gt;trickiness of phenylalanine&lt;/a&gt;, a substance you’d think had been studied to pieces by now. But as that link shows, D-ribose is in the same category: the crystallographic literature for years was all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about something even more simple than those? I refer to the most simple amino acid of all, glycine. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/anie.201800741&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has some details on its polymorphs, and the ridiculously subtle effects that cause them to form. There are three that form under “normal” conditions from aqueous solution, and while the gamma one is the most thermodynamically stable, the alpha one is kinetically favored. Adding small amounts of simple alcohols to the aqueous solution starts producing mixtures of the alpha and beta forms, though, and eventually, as the alcohol concentration goes up, you only get the beta form. All classic polymorph behavior. But why? Here’s what the authors found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that the alpha-form starts growing in a pyramidal shape, just as it usually does, but then starts incorporating methanol-solvated glycine molecules into its growing lattice. This buries methanol molecules into the crystal as it continues forming, and creates zones of higher polarity because of the different orientation of those solvated glycines (and the slight deformations in the nearest neighbor glycine arrangements as well). The normal arrangement in the crystal is a sort of “canceled-out” glycine dimer, but that gets disrupted into a more polarizable form. That’s the origin of the pyroelectric effect they’re able to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this starts happening, that developing surface of the crystal ends up “poisoned”, as some molecular dynamic simulations suggest, by the methanols incorporated into the lattice. The new surface doesn’t recognize the usual glycine-dimer form so readily, and further growth is inhibited – you see truncated pyramids of the alpha-form that have stopped in their tracks. Meanwhile, the beta-form end up with one surface (a more hydrophilic one) similarly poisoned and inhibited, but another one (a more hydrophobic one) is totally unaffected, so the crystal grows more rapidly along that face and produces long rods of the beta-form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of detail answers some questions and raises others. There are probably all sorts of metastable crystal forms (and crystal surfaces) showing up in complex polymorph situations, and the ability to see and characterize these things will (as in this case) give us a better physical picture of what’s going on. But predicting such behavior is another thing entirely. You’d hope as we start to pile up enough detail that predictive power will start to emerge (hello, machine learning). That’s a reasonable hope, but there’s no reason that things have to work out that way. The whole “Big Data” effort across various sciences is putting that view of the world to the test, and sometimes it’s going to work out and sometimes it isn’t.

We evaluated the feasibility and safety of nictitating membrane fixation to address reduced contact lens stability by the nictitating membrane in a rabbit model. Under general anesthesia, twelve animals received a horizontal mattress suture between the nictitating membrane and the upper eyelid of one eye. To assess the effects of this technique and secondary side effects, contact lens stability test, Schirmer tear test, tear break-up time measurement, eye tissue pathology and morphology were evaluated. Contact lens stability was increased after nictitating membrane fixation. The percentage of contact lens retention in the nictitating membrane fixed rabbit after 4 hours was 90% whereas that in the untreated rabbit was 42.5%. In addition, there were no significant differences in tear quantity and quality between the fixed and untreated eyes. Furthermore, no remarkable pathological lesions were found in gross observation during the 1-month time period or the following pathological examination. In this study, we demonstrated that nictitating membrane fixation increases contact lens stability without specific side effects using a rabbit model. This minimally invasive procedure could be useful when designing animal models for testing new contact lenses and has potential to apply to other biomaterial research on the ocular surface.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>J.

Background/Objectives &lt;p&gt;Abdominal obesity (AO) is associated with elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases; however, this association is less clear for non-obese people. We estimated the association of AO and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and disease in non-obese adult individuals from Chile.&lt;/p&gt; Subjects/Methods &lt;p&gt;5248 adults (15 years of age or older) of both sexes from the Chilean National Health Survey (October 2009 –September 2010, response rate 85%.) were included. Information on myocardial infarction and stroke was self-reported. BMI, waist circumference (WC), arterial pressure, plasma glucose, and cholesterol levels were measured. Predictive accuracy of WC was evaluated by area under curve of receiver operating characteristic analysis and cut off points were established by Youden Index. Relationship between AO and CVRF was analyzed by Chi-squared tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Normal weight/overweight/obesity were present in 34.4%/45.2%/18.1% of men and 33.4%/33.6%/27.5% of women. Predictive accuracy of WC to identify at least one CVRF was 0.70/0.67 and optimal cutoff points for WC in non-obese subjects were 91/83 cm in men/women, respectively. AO was present in 98.2%/99.1% of obese, 70.5%/77.4% of overweight and 12.4%/16.4% of normal weight men/women. AO was associated with increased frequency of CVRF in overweight men (6/8 and stroke) and women (4/8) and higher frequency in normal weight men (8/8 and myocardial infarction/stroke) and women (6/8 and myocardial infarction).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;WC cutoff points calculated for non-obese chilean population discriminate more differences in CVRF in normal weight woman. AO significantly increases the frequency of CVRF and diseases in overweight and especially normal weight individuals. WC can be used as a low cost, feasible and reproducible predictor for CVRF in non-obese individuals in most clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Beatriz Villanueva</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194644</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5eb:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>744df93c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beatriz Villanueva, Antonio Arteaga, Alberto Maiz, Víctor A.

The polyphagous insect-pest, &lt;i&gt;Helicoverpa armigera&lt;/i&gt;, is a serious threat to a number of economically important crops. Chemical application and/or cultivation of &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; transgenic crops are the two strategies available now for insect-pest management. However, environmental pollution and long-term sustainability are major concerns against these two options. RNAi is now considered as a promising technology to complement &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; to tackle insect-pests menace. In this study, we report host-delivered silencing of &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt; gene, encoding the predominant isoform of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;armigera&lt;/i&gt; acetylcholinesterase, by an artificial microRNA, &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1. Arabidopsis pre-miRNA164b was modified by replacing miR164b/miR164b* sequences with &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1/&lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1* sequences. The recombinant &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-preamiRNA1 was put under the control of CaMV 35S promoter and NOS terminator of plant binary vector pBI121, and the resultant vector cassette was used for tobacco transformation. Two transgenic tobacco lines expressing &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1 was used for detached leaf insect feeding bioassays.

The polyphagous insect-pest, &lt;i&gt;Helicoverpa armigera&lt;/i&gt;, is a serious threat to a number of economically important crops. Chemical application and/or cultivation of &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; transgenic crops are the two strategies available now for insect-pest management. However, environmental pollution and long-term sustainability are major concerns against these two options. RNAi is now considered as a promising technology to complement &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; to tackle insect-pests menace. In this study, we report host-delivered silencing of &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt; gene, encoding the predominant isoform of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;armigera&lt;/i&gt; acetylcholinesterase, by an artificial microRNA, &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1. Arabidopsis pre-miRNA164b was modified by replacing miR164b/miR164b* sequences with &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1/&lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1* sequences. The recombinant &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-preamiRNA1 was put under the control of CaMV 35S promoter and NOS terminator of plant binary vector pBI121, and the resultant vector cassette was used for tobacco transformation. Two transgenic tobacco lines expressing &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1 was used for detached leaf insect feeding bioassays. Larval mortality of 25% and adult deformity of 20% were observed in transgenic treated insect group over that control tobacco treated insect group. The reduction in the steady-state level of &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA was 70–80% in the defective adults compared to control. Our results demonstrate promise for host-delivered amiRNA-mediated silencing of &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt; gene for &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;armigera&lt;/i&gt; management.</description><published>1521234000000</published><title>Silencing of &amp;lt;i&gt;HaAce1&amp;lt;/i&gt; gene by host-delivered artificial microRNA disrupts growth and development of &amp;lt;i&gt;Helicoverpa armigera&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019766?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019766?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019766?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1522737999000</published><author><name>Narges Nikoofard</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b47:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><fingerprint>54dbf27c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Dynamic stability of nano-fibers self-assembled from short amphiphilic A6D peptides</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00218</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>419</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00218/20180323/images/medium/jm-2018-00218j_0007.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00218</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/mDy73nswOPg/acs.jmedchem.8b00218</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521777600000</published><author><name>Rui Liu, Patricia A.

Various approaches have been proposed to address the delineation of built-up areas for a wide range of applications. Recently developed approaches are based on the increasing availability of road network data. However, most approaches have employed one or more parameters to divide built-up from non-built-up areas. Very few studies have discussed how to determine appropriate thresholds for such parameters. This study employed an empirical approach for threshold determination, and validated that the approach is applicable for the delineation of built-up areas using road network data. A series of experiments were designed to investigate the most-appropriate thresholds (determined using a similarity measure) for multiple parameters of three existing approaches (street blocks, grid-based, and kernel density) with regard to different administrative regions and cities/towns.

Further, reconstructing transmission networks for fast-evolving viruses like HIV may have the potential to greatly enhance epidemic intervention, but transmission network reconstruction methods have been inadequately studied, largely because it is difficult to obtain &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; sets on which to test them and properly measure their performance. Results: We introduce FAVITES, a robust framework for simulating realistic datasets for epidemics that are caused by fast-evolving pathogens like HIV. FAVITES creates a generative model that produces many items relevant to an epidemic, such as contact networks, transmission networks, phylogenetic trees, and error-prone sequence datasets. FAVITES is designed to be flexible and extensible by dividing the generative model into modules, each of which is expressed as a fixed API that can be implemented using various sub-models. We use FAVITES to simulate HIV datasets resembling the San Diego epidemic and show that the simulated datasets are realistic.

Further, reconstructing transmission networks for fast-evolving viruses like HIV may have the potential to greatly enhance epidemic intervention, but transmission network reconstruction methods have been inadequately studied, largely because it is difficult to obtain &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; sets on which to test them and properly measure their performance. Results: We introduce FAVITES, a robust framework for simulating realistic datasets for epidemics that are caused by fast-evolving pathogens like HIV. FAVITES creates a generative model that produces many items relevant to an epidemic, such as contact networks, transmission networks, phylogenetic trees, and error-prone sequence datasets. FAVITES is designed to be flexible and extensible by dividing the generative model into modules, each of which is expressed as a fixed API that can be implemented using various sub-models. We use FAVITES to simulate HIV datasets resembling the San Diego epidemic and show that the simulated datasets are realistic. We then use the simulated data to make inferences about the epidemic and how it is impacted by increased treatment efforts. We also study two transmission network reconstruction methods and their effectiveness in detecting fast-growing clusters. Availability and implementation: FAVITES is available at https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES, and a Docker image can be found on DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com/r/niemasd/favites).</description><published>1523084400000</published><title>FAVITES: simultaneous simulation of transmission networks, phylogenetic trees, and sequences [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195407</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195407</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195407</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alfredo Pauciullo, Danlami Moses Ogah, Marco Iannaccone, Georg Erhardt, Liliana Di Stasio, Gianfranco Cosenza&lt;/p&gt;
Oxytocin is a neurohypophysial peptide linked to a wide range of biological functions, including milk ejection, temperament and reproduction. Aims of the present study were a) the characterization of the &lt;i&gt;OXT&lt;/i&gt; (Oxytocin-neurophysin I) gene and its regulatory regions in Old and New world camelids; b) the investigation of the genetic diversity and the discovery of markers potentially affecting the gene regulation. On average, the gene extends over 814 bp, ranging between 825 bp in dromedary, 811 bp in Bactrian and 810 bp in llama and alpaca. Such difference in size is due to a duplication event of 21 bp in dromedary. The main regulatory elements, including the composite hormone response elements (CHREs), were identified in the promoter, whereas the presence of mature microRNAs binding sequences in the 3’UTR improves the knowledge on the factors putatively involved in the &lt;i&gt;OXT&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation, although their specific biological effect needs to be still elucidated. The sequencing of genomic DNA allowed the identification of 17 intraspecific polymorphisms and 69 nucleotide differences among the four species. One of these (MF464535:g.622C&gt;G) is responsible, in alpaca, for the loss of a consensus sequence for the transcription factor SP1. Furthermore, the same SNP falls within a CpG island and it creates a new methylation site, thus opening future possibilities of investigation to verify the influence of the novel allelic variant in the &lt;i&gt;OXT&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation. A PCR-RFLP method was setup for the genotyping and the frequency of the allele C was 0.93 in a population of 71 alpacas. The obtained data clarify the structure of &lt;i&gt;OXT&lt;/i&gt; gene in domestic camelids and add knowledge to the genetic variability of a genomic region, which has received little investigation so far. These findings open the opportunity for new investigations, including association studies with productive and reproductive traits.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Alfredo Pauciullo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195407</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7693a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>17b8f840</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfredo Pauciullo, Danlami Moses Ogah, Marco Iannaccone, Georg Erhardt, Liliana Di Stasio, Gianfranco Cosenza&lt;/p&gt;

The spatial architecture of signaling pathways and the interaction with cell size and morphology are complex, but little understood. With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology, it becomes crucial to understand intracellular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We suggest an estimate of average concentration for arbitrary cell shapes depending on the cell volume and cell surface area. The normalized variance, known from image analysis, is suggested as an alternative measure to quantify the deviation from the average concentration. A mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space is presented, providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. Quantification of signaling time scales reveals that signal propagation is faster at the membrane than at the nucleus, while this time difference decreases with the number of signaling components in the cytosol. Our investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades with feedback and asymmetric cell shapes. We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006075</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006075</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162ab8d3c72:d9a76:a077e55f</id><crawled>1523296582770</crawled><fingerprint>55f062a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wolfgang Giese, Gregor Milicic, Andreas Schröder, Edda Klipp&lt;/p&gt;

Household air pollution from burning solid fuels is responsible for an estimated 2.9 million premature deaths worldwide each year and 4.5% of global disability-adjusted life years, while cooking and fuel collection pose a considerable time burden, particularly for women and children. Cleaner burning biomass-fuelled cookstoves have the potential to lower exposure to household air pollution as well as reduce fuelwood demand by increasing the combustion efficiency of cooking fires, which may in turn yield ancillary benefits in other domains. The present paper capitalises on opportunities offered by the Cooking and Pneumonia Study (CAPS), the largest randomised trial of biomass-fuelled cookstoves on health outcomes conducted to date, the design of which allows for the evaluation of additional outcomes at scale. This mixed methods study assesses the impact of cookstoves on primary school absenteeism in Karonga district, northern Malawi, in particular by conferring health and time and resource gains on young people aged 5–18. The analysis combines quantitative data from 6168 primary school students with in-depth interviews and focus group discussions carried out among 48 students in the same catchment area in 2016. Negative binomial regression models find no evidence that the cookstoves affected primary school absenteeism overall [IRR 0.92 (0.71–1.18), p = 0.51]. Qualitative analysis suggests that the cookstoves did not sufficiently improve household health to influence school attendance, while the time and resource burdens associated with cooking activities—although reduced in intervention households—were considered to be compatible with school attendance in both trial arms. More research is needed to assess whether the cookstoves influenced educational outcomes not captured by the attendance measure available, such as timely arrival to school or hours spent on homework.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Christine A.

Urinary type IV collagen (U-Col4) and albumin excretion is evaluated to monitor the development of diabetic kidney disease. However, U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, 1067 participants without diabetes and with urinary albumin-creatinine ratio &amp;lt;300 mg/gCr (normo- or microalbuminuria) who underwent an annual health examination in 2004 were enrolled and observed for 5 years. They were divided according to the amount of U-Col4 or urinary albumin excreted. The decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated. In participants with eGFR ≥80 mL/min, abnormal U-Col4 excretion was indicated as a significant independent risk factor for 10% eGFR change per year, which is one of the prognostic factors for the development of end-stage kidney disease. Moreover, in contrast to urinary albumin excretion, U-Col4 excretion was not related to age or kidney function, suggesting that some individuals with abnormal U-Col4 excretion can have an independent hidden risk for the development of kidney dysfunction. In conclusion, it is important to measure U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes to determine changes in renal features in every individual and help detect future complications such as diabetic kidney disease. If U-Col4 excretion is abnormal, kidney manifestation should be carefully followed up, even if the kidney function and urinalysis findings are normal.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Fumi Kishi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195523</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd081:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>a4d1fbb0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fumi Kishi, Kojiro Nagai, Norimichi Takamatsu, Tatsuya Tominaga, Masanori Tamaki, Eriko Shibata, Taichi Murakami, Seiji Kishi, Hideharu Abe, Yasuhiko Koezuka, Naoto Minagawa, Go Ichien, Toshio Doi&lt;/p&gt;

To elucidate the association between renal hyperfiltration (RHF) and incident proteinuria, the data from 11,559,520 Korean adults who had undergone health screenings ≥ 3 times between 2009 and 2014 and had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and negative dipstick test for proteinuria at baseline, were retrospectively analyzed. GFR was estimated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine, and RHF was defined as GFR &gt;95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile adjusted for sex, age, body size, and diabetes and/or hypertension medication. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of incident proteinuria in the RHF was 1.083 (95% CI, 1.069~1.097) compared to that of the non-RHF with Cox regression model. The association between RHF and incident proteinuria was not only in diabetic but also in non-diabetic subjects. This association was not observed in women (p for interaction &amp;lt;0.001). A reverse J-shaped association was found between the adjusted GFR slope and aHR of incident proteinuria. Both lower and higher GFR were associated with incident proteinuria in men. In conclusion, RHF was associated with incident proteinuria in men.

GFR was estimated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine, and RHF was defined as GFR &gt;95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile adjusted for sex, age, body size, and diabetes and/or hypertension medication. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of incident proteinuria in the RHF was 1.083 (95% CI, 1.069~1.097) compared to that of the non-RHF with Cox regression model. The association between RHF and incident proteinuria was not only in diabetic but also in non-diabetic subjects. This association was not observed in women (p for interaction &amp;lt;0.001). A reverse J-shaped association was found between the adjusted GFR slope and aHR of incident proteinuria. Both lower and higher GFR were associated with incident proteinuria in men. In conclusion, RHF was associated with incident proteinuria in men. Clinical studies are necessary to study whether the alleviation of RHF can prevent incident proteinuria.</description><published>1523653200000</published><title>Association of renal hyperfiltration with incident proteinuria - A nationwide registry study</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195233</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195233</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195233</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Fröhlich, Stefan K.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Different types of bone conduction transducers with different physical and electro-acoustic properties are available for audiometric hearing threshold measurements. The reference equivalent threshold vibratory force levels (RETVFL) specified in ISO 389–3 are based on measurements conducted with the B71 and KH70 transducers but apply to all types of transducers available for bone conduction audiometry.

Vasculature is an interface between the circulation and the hematopoietic tissue providing the means for hundreds of billions of blood cells to enter the circulation every day in a regulated fashion. The precise mechanisms that control the interactions of hematopoietic cells with the vessel wall are largely undefined. Here, we report on the development of an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; 3D human marrow vascular microenvironment (VME) to study hematopoietic trafficking and the release of blood cells, specifically platelets. We show that mature megakaryocytes from aspirated marrow as well as megakaryocytes differentiated in culture from CD34+ cells can be embedded in a collagen matrix containing engineered microvessels to create a thrombopoietic VME. These megakaryocytes continue to mature, penetrate the vessel wall, and release platelets into the vessel lumen. This process can be blocked with the addition of antibodies specific for CXCR4, indicating that CXCR4 is required for megakaryocyte migration, though whether it is sufficient is unclear. The 3D marrow VME system shows considerable potential for mechanistic studies defining the role of marrow vasculature in thrombopoiesis. Through a stepwise addition or removal of individual marrow components, this model provides potential to define key pathways responsible for the release of platelets and other blood cells.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Surya Kotha</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195082</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575ec:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>aabb7852</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Surya Kotha, Sijie Sun, Amie Adams, Brian Hayes, Kiet T.

Transcription as the key step in gene expression is a highly regulated process. The speed of transcription elongation depends on the underlying gene sequence and varies on a gene by gene basis. The reason for this sequence dependence is not known in detail. Recently, our group studied the cross talk between the nascent RNA and the transcribing RNA polymerase by screening the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; genome for RNA sequences with high affinity to RNA Pol by performing genomic SELEX. This approach led to the identification of RNA polymerase-binding APtamers termed “RAPs”. RAPs can have positive and negative effects on gene expression. A subgroup is able to downregulate transcription via the activity of the termination factor Rho. In this study, we used a similar SELEX setup using yeast genomic DNA as source of RNA sequences and highly purified yeast RNA Pol II as bait and obtained almost 1300 yeast-derived RAPs. Yeast RAPs are found throughout the genome within genes and antisense to genes, they are overrepresented in the non-transcribed strand of yeast telomeres and underrepresented in intergenic regions. Genes harbouring a RAP are more likely to show lower mRNA levels. By determining the endogenous expression levels as well as using a reporter system, we show that RAPs located within coding regions can reduce the transcript level downstream of the RAP. Here we demonstrate that RAPs represent a novel type of regulatory RNA signal in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; that act in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and interfere with the elongating transcription machinery to reduce the transcriptional output.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Eva Klopf</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51c7:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>a37b0dbb</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eva Klopf, Murielle Moes, Fabian Amman, Bob Zimmermann, Frederike von Pelchrzim, Christina Wagner, Renée Schroeder&lt;/p&gt;

Here we demonstrate that RAPs represent a novel type of regulatory RNA signal in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; that act in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and interfere with the elongating transcription machinery to reduce the transcriptional output.</description><published>1521838800000</published><title>Nascent RNA signaling to yeast RNA Pol II during transcription elongation</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03135-2</originId><published>1520924400000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03135-2</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03135-2</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ancient flying reptile was the size of a small plane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient flying reptile was the size of a small plane, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03135-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03135-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Bounty of fossils hints that pterosaurs soared until the end of the Cretaceous.</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>8</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162208c364e:5f5608:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1520964482638</crawled><fingerprint>a9c6db9e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ancient flying reptile was the size of a small plane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient flying reptile was the size of a small plane, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03135-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03135-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Bounty of fossils hints that pterosaurs soared until the end of the Cretaceous.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03135-2/d41586-018-03135-2_15529620.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>Ancient flying reptile was the size of a small plane</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193902</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193902</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193902</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hanh Ngo, Roberto Forero, David Mountain, Daniel Fatovich, Wing Nicola Man, Peter Sprivulis, Mohammed Mohsin, Sam Toloo, Antonio Celenza, Gerard Fitzgerald, Sally McCarthy, Ken Hillman, on behalf of the Four-Hour Rule Partnership Grant &lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;In 2009, the Western Australian (WA) Government introduced the Four-Hour Rule (FHR) program. The policy stated that most patients presenting to Emergency Departments (EDs) were to be seen and either admitted, transferred, or discharged within 4 hours. This study utilised de-identified data from five participating hospitals, before and after FHR implementation, to assess the impact of the FHR on several areas of ED functioning.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A state (WA) population-based intervention study design, using longitudinal data obtained from administrative health databases via record linkage methodology, and interrupted time series analysis technique.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;There were 3,214,802 ED presentations, corresponding to 1,203,513 ED patients.After the FHR implementation, access block for patients admitted through ED for all five sites showed a significant reduction of up to 13.2% (Rate Ratio 0.868, 95%CI 0.814, 0.925) per quarter. Rate of ED attendances for most hospitals continued to rise throughout the entire study period and were unaffected by the FHR, except for one hospital. Pattern of change in ED re-attendance rate post-FHR was similar to pre-FHR, but the trend reduced for two hospitals. ED occupancy was reduced by 6.2% per quarter post-FHR for the most ‘crowded’ ED. ED length of stay and ED efficiency improved in four hospitals and deteriorated in one hospital. Time to being seen by ED clinician and Did-Not-Wait rate improved for some hospitals. Admission rates in post-FHR increased, by up to 1% per quarter, for two hospitals where the pre-FHR trend was decreasing.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The FHR had a consistent effect on ‘flow’ measures: significantly reducing ED overcrowding and access block and enhancing ED efficiency. Time-based outcome measures mostly improved with the FHR. There is some evidence of increased ED attendance, but no evidence of increased ED re-attendance. Effects on patient disposition status were mixed. Overall, this reflects the value of investing resources into the ED/hospital system to improve efficiency and patient experience. Further research is required to illuminate the exact mechanisms of the effects of FHR on the ED and hospital functioning across Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Hanh Ngo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193902</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9fb:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>dc855d44</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanh Ngo, Roberto Forero, David Mountain, Daniel Fatovich, Wing Nicola Man, Peter Sprivulis, Mohammed Mohsin, Sam Toloo, Antonio Celenza, Gerard Fitzgerald, Sally McCarthy, Ken Hillman, on behalf of the Four-Hour Rule Partnership Grant &lt;/p&gt;

Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived significance of their work with the citation count as the most commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate scientific research. To better understand the relationship between metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of previously published research. Focusing on a specific issue of the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/i&gt; published in 2003, respondents were asked to select which articles they thought best matched importance and significance given several contexts: highest number of citations, most significant (subjectively defined), most likely to share among chemists, and most likely to share with a broader audience. The answers to the survey can be summed up in several observations. The ability of respondents to predict the citation counts of established research is markedly lower than the ability of those counts to be predicted by the h-index of the corresponding author of each article. This observation is conserved even when only considering responses from chemists whose expertise falls within the subdiscipline that best describes the work performed in an article. Respondents view both cited papers and significant papers differently than papers that should be shared with chemists. We conclude from our results that peer judgements of importance and significance differ from metrics-based measurements, and that chemists should work with bibliometricians to develop metrics that better capture the nuance of opinions on the importance of a given piece of research.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Rachel Borchardt</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194903</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4248:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>42b24064</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rachel Borchardt, Cullen Moran, Stuart Cantrill, Chemjobber, See Arr Oh, Matthew R.

Cancer affects 39.6% of Americans at some point during their lifetime. Solid tumor microenvironments are characterized by a disorganized, leaky vasculature that promotes regions of low oxygenation (hypoxia). Tumor hypoxia is a key predictor of poor treatment outcome for all radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy and surgery procedures, and is a hallmark of metastatic potential. In particular, the radiation therapy dose needed to achieve the same tumor control probability in hypoxic tissue as in normoxic tissue can be up to 3 times higher. Even very small tumors (&amp;lt;2–3 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) comprise 10–30% of hypoxic regions in the form of chronic and/or transient hypoxia fluctuating over the course of seconds to days. We investigate the potential of recently developed lipid-stabilized oxygen microbubbles (OMBs) to improve the therapeutic ratio of RT. OMBs, but not nitrogen microbubbles (NMBs), are shown to significantly increase dissolved oxygen content when added to water in vitro and increase tumor oxygen levels in vivo in a rat fibrosarcoma model. Tumor control is significantly improved with OMB but not NMB intra-tumoral injections immediately prior to RT treatment and effect size is shown to depend on initial tumor volume on RT treatment day, as expected.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Samantha M.

Tumor control is significantly improved with OMB but not NMB intra-tumoral injections immediately prior to RT treatment and effect size is shown to depend on initial tumor volume on RT treatment day, as expected.</description><published>1523307600000</published><title>Oxygen microbubbles improve radiotherapy tumor control in a rat fibrosarcoma model – A preliminary study</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03430-y</originId><published>1521615600000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03430-y</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03430-y</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diamond device paves way for first practical microwave lasers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diamond device paves way for first practical microwave lasers, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03430-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03430-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Physicists create long-sought continuous maser that works at room temperature.</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>43</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1624a2a5410:39b84d1:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521662710800</crawled><fingerprint>be3e88d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diamond device paves way for first practical microwave lasers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diamond device paves way for first practical microwave lasers, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03430-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03430-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Physicists create long-sought continuous maser that works at room temperature.</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Diamond device paves way for first practical microwave lasers</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00114</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>139</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00114/20180327/images/medium/bi-2018-001146_0006.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00114</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/TQk0VqimO_g/acs.biochem.8b00114</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522123200000</published><author><name>Chayanid Ongpipattanakul, Satish K.

Although there are several methods developed to detect DMRs, most of them are focused on detecting relatively large differences in methylation levels and fail to detect moderate, but consistent, methylation changes that might be associated to complex disorders. Results: We present mCSEA, an R package that implements a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method to identify differentially methylated regions from Illumina 450K and EPIC array data. It is especially useful for detecting subtle, but consistent, methylation differences in complex phenotypes. mCSEA also implements functions to integrate gene expression data and to detect genes with significant correlations among methylation and gene expression patterns. Using simulated datasets, we show that mCSEA outperforms other tools in detecting DMRs. In addition, we applied mCSEA to a previously published dataset of sibling pairs discordant for intrauterine hyperglycemia exposure.

Although there are several methods developed to detect DMRs, most of them are focused on detecting relatively large differences in methylation levels and fail to detect moderate, but consistent, methylation changes that might be associated to complex disorders. Results: We present mCSEA, an R package that implements a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method to identify differentially methylated regions from Illumina 450K and EPIC array data. It is especially useful for detecting subtle, but consistent, methylation differences in complex phenotypes. mCSEA also implements functions to integrate gene expression data and to detect genes with significant correlations among methylation and gene expression patterns. Using simulated datasets, we show that mCSEA outperforms other tools in detecting DMRs. In addition, we applied mCSEA to a previously published dataset of sibling pairs discordant for intrauterine hyperglycemia exposure. We found several differentially methylated promoters in genes related to metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes, demonstrating the potential of mCSEA to identify differentially methylated regions not detected by other methods.

The posterior auricular muscle (PAM) reflex to sounds has been used clinically to determine hearing threshold as an alternative to other audiological diagnostic measures such as the auditory brainstem response. We have shown that the PAM response is also sensitive to interaural timing differences in normally hearing adults. PAM responses were evoked by both ipsilateral/ contralateral monaural stimulation and by binaural stimulation. Introducing sound delays ipsilaterally or contralaterally decreased the PAM response amplitude and increased its latency. The PAM response in this study shows a qualitatively similar pattern to that seen by the binaural interaction component (BIC) of the auditory brainstem potential to binaural clicks described in previous studies, in that both: have their shortest latency and maximal amplitudes centred around zero interaural timing differences, have response latencies increase with increasing interaural delays up to 1.2 ms and have response amplitudes decrease with increasing interaural delays of up to 1.2 ms. Our data show that the PAM response may be useful in measuring binaural integration in humans non-invasively for diagnostic or research studies.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>T.

Examining condition-specific patterns of co-expression can provide insights into the underlying cellular processes activated in a particular condition. One challenge in this type of analysis is that the sample sizes in each condition are usually small, making the statistical inference of co-expression patterns highly underpowered. A joint network construction that borrows information from related structures across conditions has the potential to improve the power of the analysis. One possible approach to constructing the co-expression network is to use the Gaussian graphical model. Though several methods are available for joint estimation of multiple graphical models, they do not fully account for the heterogeneity between samples and between co-expression patterns introduced by condition specificity. Here we develop the condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL), a data-driven approach to incorporate condition specificity in the estimation of co-expression networks. We show that this method improves the accuracy with which networks are learned. The application of this method on a rat multi-tissue dataset and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset provides interesting biological insights.

Examining condition-specific patterns of co-expression can provide insights into the underlying cellular processes activated in a particular condition. One challenge in this type of analysis is that the sample sizes in each condition are usually small, making the statistical inference of co-expression patterns highly underpowered. A joint network construction that borrows information from related structures across conditions has the potential to improve the power of the analysis. One possible approach to constructing the co-expression network is to use the Gaussian graphical model. Though several methods are available for joint estimation of multiple graphical models, they do not fully account for the heterogeneity between samples and between co-expression patterns introduced by condition specificity. Here we develop the condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL), a data-driven approach to incorporate condition specificity in the estimation of co-expression networks. We show that this method improves the accuracy with which networks are learned. The application of this method on a rat multi-tissue dataset and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset provides interesting biological insights. In both analyses, we identify numerous modules enriched for Gene Ontology functions and observe that the modules that are upregulated in a particular condition are often involved in condition-specific activities. Interestingly, we observe that the genes strongly associated with survival time in the TCGA dataset are less likely to be network hubs, suggesting that genes associated with cancer progression are likely to govern specific functions, rather than regulating a large number of biological processes. Additionally, we observed that the tumor-specific hub genes tend to have few shared edges with normal tissue, revealing tumor-specific regulatory mechanism.</description><published>1522220400000</published><title>Condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL): an adaptive procedure for inferring condition-specific gene co-expression network [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195290</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195290</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195290</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Celestino Ordóñez, Carlos Cabo, Agustín Menéndez, Antonio Bello&lt;/p&gt;
In cases of natural disasters, epidemics or even in dangerous situations like an act of terrorism, battle fields, a shooting or a mountain accident, finding survivors is a challenge. In these kind of situations it is sometimes critical to know if a person has vital signs or not, without the need to be in contact with the victim, thus avoiding jeopardizing the lives of the rescue workers. In this work, we propose the use of video magnification techniques to detect small movements in human bodies due to breathing that are invisible to the naked eye. Two different video magnification techniques, intensity-based and phase-based, were tested. The utility of these techniques to detect people who are alive but injured in risk situations was verified by simulating a scene with three people involved in an accident. Several factors such as camera stability, distance to the object, light conditions, magnification factor or computing time were analyzed.

Fitting canine cancer incidences through a conventional regression model assumes constant statistical relationships across the study area in estimating the model coefficients. However, it is often more realistic to consider that these relationships may vary over space. Such a condition, known as spatial non-stationarity, implies that the model coefficients need to be estimated locally. In these kinds of local models, the geographic scale, or spatial extent, employed for coefficient estimation may also have a pervasive influence. This is because important variations in the local model coefficients across geographic scales may impact the understanding of local relationships. In this study, we fitted canine cancer incidences across Swiss municipal units through multiple regional models. We computed diagnostic summaries across the different regional models, and contrasted them with the diagnostics of the conventional regression model, using value-by-alpha maps and scalograms. The results of this comparative assessment enabled us to identify variations in the goodness-of-fit and coefficient estimates. We detected spatially non-stationary relationships, in particular, for the variables related to biological risk factors. These variations in the model coefficients were more important at small geographic scales, making a case for the need to model canine cancer incidences locally in contrast to more conventional global approaches. However, we contend that prior to undertaking local modeling efforts, a deeper understanding of the effects of geographic scale is needed to better characterize and identify local model relationships.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Gianluca Boo</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179363c:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>231e0806</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gianluca Boo, Stefan Leyk, Christopher Brunsdon, Ramona Graf, Andreas Pospischil, Sara Irina Fabrikant&lt;/p&gt;

Genomic prediction exploits single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome for predicting genetic merit of selection candidates. In most models for genomic prediction, e.g. BayesA, B, C, R and GBLUP, independence of SNP effects is assumed. However, SNP effects are expected to be locally dependent given the presence of a nearby QTL because SNPs surrounding the QTL do not segregate independently. A consequence of ignoring this dependence is that SNPs with small effects may be overly shrunk, e.g. effects from markers with high minor allele frequencies (MAF) that flank QTL with low MAF. A nested mixture model (BayesN) is developed to account for the dependence of effects of SNPs that are closely linked, where the effects of SNPs in every non-overlapping genomic window &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; follow a point mass at zero for all SNPs or a mixture of some SNPs with nonzero effects and others with zero effects. It can be regarded as a parsimonious alternative to the existing antedependence model, antiBayesB, which allow a nonstationary dependence of SNP effects. Illumina 777K BovineHD genotypes from 948 Angus cattle were used to simulate 5,000 offspring, with 4,000 used for training and 1,000 for validation. Scenarios with 300 common (MAF &gt; 0.05) or rare (MAF &amp;lt; 0.05) QTL randomly selected from segregating SNPs were replicated 8 times. SNPs corresponding to QTL were masked from a 600k panel comprising SNPs with MAF &gt; 0.05 or a 50k evenly spaced subset of these. Compared with BayesB and a modified antiBayesB, BayesN improved the accuracy of prediction up to 2.0% with 50k SNPs and up to 7.0% with 600k SNPs, most improvements occurring in the rare QTL scenario. Computing time was reduced up to 60% with 50k SNPs and up to 75% with 600k SNPs. BayesN is an accurate and computationally efficient method for genomic prediction with whole-genome SNPs, especially for traits with rare QTL.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Jian Zeng</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194683</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087f1:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><fingerprint>2b0a2650</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Zeng, Dorian Garrick, Jack Dekkers, Rohan Fernando&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Cochrane reviewers are strongly encouraged to evaluate the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes by using the GRADE approach and to report these results in a Summary of Findings (SoF) table. We aimed to assess whether outcomes reported in the SoF table of Cochrane reviews could be considered patient-important outcomes (PIOs) and the quality of the available evidence for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a methodological review of Cochrane reviews published between March 2011 and September 2014. For a random sample of Cochrane reviews reporting a SoF table, we extracted all outcomes reported in this table and evaluated whether they could be considered PIOs (i.e., mortality, other clinical events, adverse events, function, pain, quality of life and therapeutic decisions). Then, we collected the quality of evidence for every outcome in these SoF tables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 290 reviews issued by 47 of the 53 Cochrane Review Groups. Every SoF table included a median of 5 outcomes, for a total of 1414 outcomes; 1089 (77%) could be considered PIOs. Almost all reviews (n = 278, 96%) included at least one PIO in their SoF table. The quality of evidence for the outcomes was high for 12% (n = 168), moderate for 28% (n = 402) and low or very low for 45% (n = 640). Less than one quarter of reviews (n = 63) included at least one PIO with high-quality evidence that favoured a benefit of the experimental intervention evaluated in half of them (n = 34 reviews).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Many outcomes reported in the SoF table of recent Cochrane reviews can be considered PIOs. However, the quality of available evidence remains limited for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Youri Yordanov</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195460</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d732:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>941b171e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Youri Yordanov, Agnes Dechartres, Philippe Ravaud&lt;/p&gt;

For a random sample of Cochrane reviews reporting a SoF table, we extracted all outcomes reported in this table and evaluated whether they could be considered PIOs (i.e., mortality, other clinical events, adverse events, function, pain, quality of life and therapeutic decisions). Then, we collected the quality of evidence for every outcome in these SoF tables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 290 reviews issued by 47 of the 53 Cochrane Review Groups. Every SoF table included a median of 5 outcomes, for a total of 1414 outcomes; 1089 (77%) could be considered PIOs. Almost all reviews (n = 278, 96%) included at least one PIO in their SoF table. The quality of evidence for the outcomes was high for 12% (n = 168), moderate for 28% (n = 402) and low or very low for 45% (n = 640). Less than one quarter of reviews (n = 63) included at least one PIO with high-quality evidence that favoured a benefit of the experimental intervention evaluated in half of them (n = 34 reviews).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Many outcomes reported in the SoF table of recent Cochrane reviews can be considered PIOs. However, the quality of available evidence remains limited for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522962000000</published><title>Patient-important outcomes in systematic reviews: Poor quality of evidence</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3305.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3305.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3305.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>By systematically manipulating head position relative to the body and eye position relative to the head, previous studies have shown that vestibular tuning curves of neurons in the ventral intraparietal (VIP) area remain invariant when expressed in body-/world-centered coordinates.

The processes regulating peripheral naive T-cell numbers and clonal diversity remain poorly understood. Conceptually, homeostatic mechanisms must fall into the broad categories of neutral (simple random birth–death models), competition (regulation of cell numbers through quorum-sensing, perhaps via limiting shared resources), adaptation (involving cell-intrinsic changes in homeostatic fitness, defined as net growth rate over time), or selection (involving the loss or outgrowth of cell populations deriving from intercellular variation in fitness). There may also be stably maintained heterogeneity within the naive T-cell pool. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we confront very general models of these processes with an array of experimental data, both new and published. While reduced competition for homeostatic stimuli may impact cell survival or proliferation in neonates or under moderate to severe lymphopenia, we show that the only mechanism capable of explaining multiple, independent experimental studies of naive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell homeostasis in mice from young adulthood into old age is one of adaptation, in which cells act independently and accrue a survival or proliferative advantage continuously with their post-thymic age. However, aged naive T cells may also be functionally impaired, and so the accumulation of older cells via ‘conditioning through experience’ may contribute to reduced immune responsiveness in the elderly.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_sQDfPObu6Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003949</href></item></canonical><engagement>141</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003949</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162b5d1647d:50b536:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523468821629</crawled><fingerprint>49ad6524</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagementRate>7.83</engagementRate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sanket Rane, Thea Hogan, Benedict Seddon, Andrew J.

We sought to identify biomarkers which delineated individual hypertrophic responses to resistance training. Untrained, college-aged males engaged in full-body resistance training (3 d/wk) for 12 weeks. Body composition via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL) thickness via ultrasound, blood, VL muscle biopsies, and three-repetition maximum (3-RM) squat strength were obtained prior to (PRE) and following (POST) 12 weeks of training. K-means cluster analysis based on VL thickness changes identified LOW [n = 17; change (mean±SD) = +0.11±0.14 cm], modest (MOD; n = 29, +0.40±0.06 cm), and high (HI; n = 21, +0.69±0.14 cm) responders. Biomarkers related to histology, ribosome biogenesis, proteolysis, inflammation, and androgen signaling were analyzed between clusters. There were main effects of time (POST&gt;PRE, p&amp;lt;0.05) but no cluster×time interactions for increases in DXA lean body mass, type I and II muscle fiber cross sectional area and myonuclear number, satellite cell number, and macronutrients consumed. Interestingly, PRE VL thickness was ~12% greater in LOW versus HI (p = 0.021), despite POST values being ~12% greater in HI versus LOW (p = 0.006). However there was only a weak correlation between PRE VL thickness scores and change in VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.114, p = 0.005). Forced post hoc analysis indicated that muscle total RNA levels (i.e., ribosome density) did not significantly increase in the LOW cluster (351±70 ng/mg to 380±62, p = 0.253), but increased in the MOD (369±115 to 429±92, p = 0.009) and HI clusters (356±77 to 470±134, p&amp;lt;0.001; POST HI&gt;POST LOW, p = 0.013). Nonetheless, there was only a weak association between change in muscle total RNA and VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.079, p = 0.026). IL-1β mRNA levels decreased in the MOD and HI clusters following training (p&amp;lt;0.05), although associations between this marker and VL thickness changes were not significant (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0002, p = 0.919). In conclusion, individuals with lower pre-training VL thickness values and greater increases muscle total RNA levels following 12 weeks of resistance training experienced greater VL muscle growth, although these biomarkers individually explained only ~8–11% of the variance in hypertrophy.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Christopher B.

Network analysis of large metagenomic datasets generated by current sequencing technologies can reveal significant co-occurrence patterns between microbial species of a biological community. These patterns can be analyzed in terms of pairwise combinations between all species comprising a community.

This was followed by an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; evaluation of the predicted microbe-microbe co-occurrences, where we chose species pairs &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium adolescentis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Roseburia inulinivorans&lt;/i&gt; as model organisms for our study.

Worldwide, 500,000 cases of head and neck cancer (HNC) are reported each year and the primary treatment for HNC is radiotherapy. Although the goal of radiotherapy is to target the tumor, secondary exposure occurs in surrounding normal tissues, such as the salivary glands. As a result, despite successful treatment of the cancer, patients are left with long-term side effects due to direct damage to the salivary glands. The effect is chronic and currently there is no treatment. Stem cells are an attractive therapeutic option for treatment of radiation-induced glandular dysfunction because of the potential to regenerate damaged cell populations and restore salivary gland function. However, limited knowledge about the endogenous stem cell population post irradiation hinders the development for stem cell-based therapies. In this study, an ex vivo sphere formation cell culture system was utilized to assess the self-renewal capacity of cells derived from parotid salivary glands at a chronic time point following radiation. Salivary glands from irradiated mice generate significantly fewer salispheres, but can be stimulated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to generate an equivalent number of salispheres as unirradiated salivary glands. Interestingly, the number and size of salispheres formed is dependent on the concentration of FBS supplemented into the media. Salispheres derived from irradiated glands and cultured in FBS media were found to contain cells that proliferate and express progenitor and acinar cell markers such as Keratin 5, Keratin 14, Aquaporin 5, and NKCC1. Utilization of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) injections following radiation treatment restores salivary gland function and improves salisphere generation. These findings indicate that stimulation of these cellular populations may provide a promising avenue for the development of cell-based therapies for radiation-induced salivary gland damage.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Vicky T.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Individuals with metabolic syndrome have increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to test the hypothesis that a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CR-fitness), counteracts accumulation of visceral fat, decreases inflammation and lowers risk factors of the metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;The study sample included 1,293 Danes (age 49–52 years) who from 2009 to 2011 participated in the Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank, including a questionnaire, physical tests, and blood samples. Multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and plasma levels of cytokines and high sensitive C-reactive protein as outcomes and measures of abdominal obesity were added to test if they explained the potential association. Similarly, multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and factors of the metabolic syndrome as outcomes and the potential explanation by inflammatory biomarkers were tested. All models were adjusted for the effect of age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, socio-economic status, and acute inflammatory events within the preceding two weeks.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;CR-fitness was inversely associated with high sensitive C-reactive protein, Interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-18, and directly associated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but not associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma or IL-1β. Abdominal obesity could partly explain the significant associations. Moreover, CR-fitness was inversely associated with an overall metabolic syndrome score, as well as triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin A&lt;sub&gt;1c&lt;/sub&gt;, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and directly associated with high-density lipoprotein. Single inflammatory biomarkers and a combined inflammatory score partly explained these associations.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Data suggest that CR-fitness has anti-inflammatory effects that are partly explained by a reduction in abdominal obesity and a decrease in the metabolic syndrome risk profile.

After implementing a tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co magnetic-resonance image guided system, ViewRay&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, we compared the associated early radiological lung density changes to those associated with a linear accelerator (LINAC). Eight patients treated with the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system were matched 1:1 with patients treated with LINAC. Prescription doses were 52 Gy or 60 Gy in four fractions, and lung dose-volumetric parameters were calculated from each planning system. The first two follow-up computed tomography (CT) were co-registered with the planning CT through deformable registration software, and lung density was measured by isodose levels. Tumor size was matched between the two groups, but the planning target volume of LINAC was larger than that of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036). With regard to clinically relevant dose-volumetric parameters in the lungs, the ipsilateral lung mean dose, &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10Gy&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;20Gy&lt;/sub&gt; were significantly poorer in tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co plans compared to LINAC plans (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, 0.036, and 0.017, respectively). Increased lung density was not observed in the first follow-up scan compared to the planning scan. A significant change of lung density was shown in the second follow-up scan and there was no meaningful difference between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for all dose regions. In addition, no patient developed clinical radiation pneumonitis until the second follow-up scan. Therefore, there was no significant difference in the early radiological lung damage between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for lung SABR despite of the inferior plan quality of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system compared to that of LINAC.

Commercial hunting for the international trade in animal hides in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century decimated many populations of aquatic wildlife in Amazonia. However, impacts varied significantly between different species and regions, depending upon hunting intensity, accessibility of habitat, and the inherent resilience of various species and their habitats. We investigated the differential responses of two Amazonian Mustelid species, the neotropical otter and giant otter, to commercial hunting pressure along the upper Rio Negro in Brazil, and examined historical factors that influenced spatial and temporal variation in commercial exploitation. We analyzed previously unanalyzed data from historical records of hide shipments to track changes in hide sales and prices for the two species in the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. We also gathered oral histories from older Baniwa people who had witnessed or participated in commercial otter hunting. These complimentary data sources reveal how intrinsic biological and social characteristics of the two otter species interacted with market forces and regional history. Whereas giant otter populations were driven to local or regional extinction during the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century by commercial hunting, neotropical otters persisted. In recent decades, giant otter populations have returned to some parts of the upper Rio Negro, a development which local people welcome as part of a generalized recovery of the ecosystems in their territory as a result of the banning of animal pelt exports and indigenous land demarcation. This paper expands the scope of the field historical ecology and reflects on the role of local knowledge in biodiversity conservation.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Natalia C.

The substitution of fish resources as ingredients for aquafeeds by those based on vegetable sources is needed to ensure aquaculture sustainability in the future. It is known that Senegalese sole (&lt;i&gt;Solea senegalensis&lt;/i&gt;) accepts high dietary content of plant ingredients without altering growth or flesh quality parameters. However, scarce information is available regarding the long-term impact of vegetable diets (combining the inclusion of both vegetable protein and oils) on the stress response and immunity of this fish species. This study aims to evaluate the concomitant effect of the extended use of vegetable protein-based diets with fish oil (FO) replacement (0, 50 or 100%) by vegetable oils (VO), on the response to acute (10 min) or prolonged (4 days) stress, induced by thermal shock. Plasma levels of cortisol, glucose and lactate as well as hepatic levels of glucose, glycogen and lactate were evaluated as primary and secondary responses to stress, 6 and 18 months after feeding the experimental diets (6 and 18 MAF). The brain monoaminergic activity in telencephalon and hypothalamus, and non-specific immune parameters were also evaluated. As expected, thermal shock induced an increase in values of plasma parameters related to stress, which was more evident in acute than in prolonged stress. Stress also affected lactate levels in the liver and the values of the alternative complement pathway-ACH50 in the plasma. Dietary substitution of FO induced an effect &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on some parameters such as decreased hepatic glucose and glycogen levels and peroxidase activity in plasma as well enhanced serotonergic activity in brain of non-stressed fish. The results obtained in some parameters indicate that there is an interaction between the use of vegetable diets with the physiological response to thermal stress, as is the case of the hepatic lactate, serotonergic neurotransmission in brain, and the activity of ACH50 in plasma. These results suggest that the inclusion of VO in plant protein based diets point to a slightly inhibited stress response, more evident for an acute than a prolonged stress.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Marta Conde-Sieira</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194353</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123920:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>2d6b30d0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marta Conde-Sieira, Manuel Gesto, Sónia Batista, Fátima Linares, José L.

These results suggest that the inclusion of VO in plant protein based diets point to a slightly inhibited stress response, more evident for an acute than a prolonged stress.</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Influence of vegetable diets on physiological and immune responses to thermal stress in Senegalese sole (&amp;lt;i&gt;Solea senegalensis&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23501-4</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23501-4</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/8PP12V8dQjo/s41598-018-23501-4</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Material Synthesis and Device Aspects of Monolayer Tungsten Diselenide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Material Synthesis and Device Aspects of Monolayer Tungsten Diselenide, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23501-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23501-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Material Synthesis and Device Aspects of Monolayer Tungsten Diselenide&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/8PP12V8dQjo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>550</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23501-4/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23501_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Zihan Yao</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23501-4</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16266d0d910:5f99c84:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522143385872</crawled><fingerprint>9471a3ec</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Material Synthesis and Device Aspects of Monolayer Tungsten Diselenide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Material Synthesis and Device Aspects of Monolayer Tungsten Diselenide, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23501-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23501-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Material Synthesis and Device Aspects of Monolayer Tungsten Diselenide&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/8PP12V8dQjo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1522134000000</published><title>Material Synthesis and Device Aspects of Monolayer Tungsten Diselenide</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019874?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019874?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019874?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1522988433000</published><author><name>Hideaki Takahashi</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b66:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><fingerprint>69c4f554</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>A simple and effective solution to the constrained QM/MM simulations</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195804</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195804</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195804</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by El-Desouky Ammar, David G.

Genetic variability in insect vectors is valuable to study vector competence determinants and to select non-vector populations that may help reduce the spread of vector-borne pathogens. We collected and tested vector competency of 15 isofemale lines of Asian citrus psyllid, &lt;i&gt;Diaphorina citri&lt;/i&gt;, vector of ‘&lt;i&gt;Candidatus&lt;/i&gt; Liberibacter asiaticus’ (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las is associated with huanglongbing (citrus greening), the most serious citrus disease worldwide. &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults were collected from orange jasmine (&lt;i&gt;Murraya paniculata&lt;/i&gt;) hedges in Florida, and individual pairs (females and males) were caged on healthy &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants for egg laying. The progeny from each pair that tested &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-negative by qPCR were maintained on &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants and considered an isofemale line. Six acquisition tests on &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults that were reared as nymphs on &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-infected citrus, from various generations of each line, were conducted to assess their acquisition rates (percentage of qPCR-positive adults). Three lines with mean acquisition rates of 28 to 32%, were classified as ‘good’ acquirers and three other lines were classified as ‘poor’ acquirers, with only 5 to 8% acquisition rates. All lines were further tested for their ability to inoculate &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by confining &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-exposed psyllids for one week onto healthy citrus leaves (6–10 adults/leaf/week), and testing the leaves for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by qPCR. Mean inoculation rates were 19 to 28% for the three good acquirer lines and 0 to 3% for the three poor acquirer lines. Statistical analyses indicated positive correlations between &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las acquisition and inoculation rates, as well as between &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las titer in the psyllids and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las acquisition or inoculation rates. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of one of the good and one of the poor acquirer lines revealed differences between them in color morphs and hemocyanin expression, but not the composition of bacterial endosymbionts.

European plum (&lt;i&gt;Prunus domestica&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an ancient domesticated species cultivated in temperate areas worldwide whose genetic structure has been scarcely analyzed to date. In this study, a broad representation of Spanish European plum germplasm collected in Northeastern Spain and a representative set of reference cultivars were compared using nuclear and chloroplast markers. The number of alleles per locus detected with the SSR markers ranged from 8 to 39, with an average of 23.4 alleles, and 8 haplotypes were identified. Bayesian model-based clustering, minimum spanning networks, and the analysis of molecular variance showed the existence of a hierarchical structure. At the first level, two genetic groups were found, one containing ‘Reine Claude’ type reference cultivars altogether with ca. 25% of local genotypes, and a second one much more diverse. This latter group split in two groups, one containing most (ca. 70%) local genotypes and some old Spanish and French reference cultivars, whereas the other included 24 reference cultivars and only six local genotypes. A third partition level allowed a significant finer delineation into five groups. As a whole, the genetic structure of European plum from Northeastern Spain was shown to be complex and conditioned by a geographical proximity factor. This study not only contributes to genetic conservation and breeding for this species at the national level, but also supports the relevance of undertaking similar tasks of collection and characterization in other unexplored areas. Moreover, this kind of research could lead to future coordinated actions for the examination of the whole European plum diversity, to define conservation strategies, and could be used to better understand the genetic control of traits of horticultural interest through association mapping.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Jorge Urrestarazu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195591</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529a:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>ec946bba</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jorge Urrestarazu, Pilar Errea, Carlos Miranda, Luis G.

N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have anti-inflammatory effects and were considered useful for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently, several studies suggested that n-3 PUFAs attenuated arthritis in animal model and human, however the mechanism is still unclear. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly produced by T helper 17 (Th17) cells which cause tissue inflammation and bone erosion leading to joint destruction. In contrast, regulatory T (Treg) cells down-regulate various immune responses by suppression of naïve T cells. The imbalance between Th17 cells and Tregs cell is important for the pathogenesis of RA. Here, we investigated whether n-3 PUFAs attenuate arthritis in collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model. We used fat-1 transgenic mice expressing the Caenorhabditis elegans fat-1 gene encoding an n-3 fatty acid desaturase that converts n-6 to n-3 fatty acids, leading to abundant n-3 fatty acids without the need of a dietary n-3 supply. Clinical arthritis score was significantly attenuated in fat-1 mice compared to wild type (WT) mice on day 7 (1.6±1.8, p = 0.012) and day 9 (1.5±1.6, p = 0.003). Ankle thickness also decreased significantly in fat-1 mice compared to WT mice (1.82±0.11, p = 0.008). The pathologic finding showed that inflammatory cell infiltration and bone destruction were reduced in fat-1 mice compared to WT. The expression levels of IL-17 and related cytokines including IL-6 and IL-23 decreased in the spleen and ankle joint tissue of fat-1 mice compared to WT mice. Furthermore, Treg cells were expanded in the spleen of fat-1 mice and Treg cell differentiation was significantly higher in fat-1 mice than in wild type (p = 0.038). These data suggest that n-3 PUFAs could attenuate arthritis through increasing the expression of FoxP3 and the differentiation of Treg, while reducing IL-17 production. Therefore, dietary supplementation of n-3 PUFAs could have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of RA.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Ji Young Kim</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194331</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e17:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>4b19ee00</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Young Kim, Kyu Lim, Kyung Hee Kim, Jin Hyun Kim, Jin Sun Choi, Seung-Cheol Shim&lt;/p&gt;

Several studies suggest that low birthweight resulting from restricted intrauterine growth can leave a metabolic footprint which may persist into adulthood. To investigate this, we performed metabolomic profiling on 5036 female twins, aged 18–80, with weight at birth information available from the TwinsUK cohort and performed independent replication in two additional cohorts. Out of 422 compounds tested, 25 metabolites associated with birthweight in these twins, replicated in 1951 men and women from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS, aged 66) and in 2391 men and women from the North Finland Birth 1986 cohort (NFBC, aged 16). We found distinct heterogeneity between sexes and, after adjusting for multiple tests and heterogeneity, two metabolites were reproducible overall (propionylcarnitine and 3-4-hydroxyphenyllactate). Testing women only, we found other metabolites associated with lower birthweight from the meta-analysis of the three cohorts (2-hydroxy-butyric acid and γ-glutamylleucine). Higher levels of all these metabolites can be linked to insulin resistance, oxidative stress or a dysfunction of energy metabolism, suggesting that low birthweight in both twins and singletons are having an impact on these pathways in adulthood.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Sarah Jane Metrustry</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194316</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:412391d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>eb11472a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah Jane Metrustry, Ville Karhunen, Mark H.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine during short-term treatment in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a comprehensive literature review of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials databases for randomized controlled trials(RCTs) comparing duloxetine or duloxetine plus other antipsychotics with placebo for the treatment of GAD in adults. Outcome measures were (1) efficacy, assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS) anxiety subscale score, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety(HAM-A) psychic and somatic anxiety factor scores, and response and remission rates based on total scores of HAM-A; (2) tolerability, assessed by discontinuation rate due to adverse events, the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events(TEAEs) and serious adverse events(SAEs). Review Manager 5.3 and Stata Version 12.0 software were used for all statistical analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis included 8 RCTs. Mean changes in the HADS anxiety subscale score [mean difference(MD) = 2.32, 95% confidence interval(CI) 1.77–2.88, P&amp;lt;0.00001] and HAM-A psychic anxiety factor score were significantly greater in patients with GAD that received duloxetine compared to those that received placebo (MD = 2.15, 95%CI 1.61–2.68, P&amp;lt;0.00001). However, there was no difference in mean change in the HAM-A somatic anxiety factor score (MD = 1.13, 95%CI 0.67–1.58, P&amp;lt;0.00001).

Given the frequency with which MAP kinase signaling is dysregulated in cancer, much effort has been focused on inhibiting RAS signaling for therapeutic benefit. KSR1, a pseudokinase that interacts with RAF, is a potential target; it was originally cloned in screens for suppressors of constitutively active RAS, and its deletion prevents RAS-mediated transformation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In this work, we used a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer to assess whether KSR1 deletion would influence tumor development in the setting of oncogenic RAS. We found that &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice on this background had a modest but significant improvement in all-cause morbidity compared to &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; cohorts. &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, however, still developed tumors, and precursor pancreatic intraepithelial neoplastic (PanIN) lesions were detected within a similar timeframe compared to &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice. No significant differences in pERK expression or in proliferation were noted. RNA sequencing also did not reveal any unique genetic signature in &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; tumors. Further studies will be needed to determine whether and in what settings KSR inhibition may be clinically useful.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Elizabeth A.

Understanding the relationships between &lt;i&gt;Coffea arabica&lt;/i&gt; L. and the native tree community of secondary forests regrowing after the abandonment of coffee plantations is important because, as a non-native species in the Neotropics, coffee can outcompete native species, reducing diversity and forests ecosystem services. We aimed to answer three questions: 1) Does coffee regeneration in secondary forests differ between shaded and unshaded abandoned plantations?; 2) How is coffee basal area related to structural attributes, species diversity and composition of the native community?; and 3) Do the relationships between coffee and native community differ between tree and sapling components? We sampled the tree and sapling components in a seasonal tropical dry forest that were previously used as shaded and unshaded coffee plantations. Coffee was the most important species in the sapling component of shaded systems, but was almost absent in unshaded ones. Coffee basal area was negatively related with the native density and absolute species richness of the sapling component; and was negatively related with tree density, and positively related with the percentage of pioneer individuals of the native tree component. Our results indicate that coffee persists in secondary forest communities even after more than 70 years of shaded-coffee plantations were abandoned, potentially reducing density and diversity of native species. Despite limitations, which hinder more general conclusions on coffee invasiveness in Brazilian secondary tropical forests, our results indicate that coffee is a strong competitor in the studied secondary forests and provide important insights for future research on this topic.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Diego Raymundo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194032</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9ff:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>2e91d1b1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Raymundo, Jamir Prado-Junior, Norberto Emídio de Oliveira-Neto, Lucas Dezidério Santana, Vagner Santiago do Vale, Tamiel Baiocchi Jacobson, Paulo Eugênio Alves Macedo de Oliveira, Fabrício Alvim Carvalho&lt;/p&gt;

Transgenic rat models of Alzheimer’s disease were used to examine differences in memory and brain histology. Double transgenic female rats (APP+PS1) over-expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) and single transgenic rats (APP21) over-expressing human APP were compared with wild type Fischer rats (WT). The Barnes maze assessed learning and memory and showed that both APP21 and APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors than the WT rats during the acquisition phase, signifying slower learning. Additionally, the APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors following a retention interval, indicating impaired memory compared to both the APP21 and WT rats. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody against amyloid-β (Aβ) showed extensive and mostly diffuse Aβ plaques in the hippocampus and dense plaques that contained tau in the cortex of the brains of the APP+PS1 rats. Furthermore, the APP+PS1 rats also showed vascular changes, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy with extensive Aβ deposits in cortical and leptomeningeal blood vessel walls and venous collagenosis. In addition to the Aβ accumulation observed in arterial, venous, and capillary walls, APP+PS1 rats also displayed enlarged blood vessels and perivascular space. Overall, the brain histopathology and behavioral assessment showed that the APP+PS1 rats demonstrated behavioral characteristics and vascular changes similar to those commonly observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Diana Klakotskaia</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195469</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd8e:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>82314836</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Klakotskaia, Cansu Agca, Rachel A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Unstable conditions of the craniocervical junction such as atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) or atlanto-axial instability (AAI) are severe injuries with a high risk of tetraplegia or death. Immobilization by a cervical collar to protect the patient from secondary damage is a standard procedure in trauma patients. If the application of a cervical collar to a patient with an unstable craniocervical condition may cause segmental motion and secondary injury to the spinal cord is unknown.The aim of the current study is (i) to analyze compression on the dural sac and (ii) to determine relative motion of the cervical spine during the procedure of applying a cervical collar in case of ligamentous unstable craniocervical junction.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Ligamentous AOD as well as AOD combined with ligamentous AAI was simulated in two newly developed cadaveric trauma models. Compression of the dural sac and segmental angulation in the upper cervical spine were measured on video fluoroscopy after myelography during the application of a cervical collar. Furthermore, overall three-dimensional motion of the cervical spine was measured by a motion tracking system.In six cadavers each, the two new trauma models on AOD and AOD combined with AAI could be implemented. Mean dural sac compression was significantly increased to -1.1 mm (-1.3 to -0.7 mm) in case of AOD and -1.2 mm (-1.6 to -0.6 mm) in the combined model of AOD and AAI. Furthermore, there is a significant increased angulation at the C0/C1 level in the AOD model. Immense three-dimensional movement up to 22.9° of cervical spine flexion was documented during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The current study pointed out that applying a cervical collar in general will cause immense three-dimensional movement. In case of unstable craniocervical junction, this leads to a dural sac compression and thus to possible damage to the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Shiyao Liao</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd06f:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>4ad99bdb</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiyao Liao, Niko R.

In case of unstable craniocervical junction, this leads to a dural sac compression and thus to possible damage to the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523048400000</published><title>Motion and dural sac compression in the upper cervical spine during the application of a cervical collar in case of unstable craniocervical junction—A study in two new cadaveric trauma models</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25169?af=R</originId><published>1522118410699</published><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25169?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25169?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626553c1cb:6ce04:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522118410699</crawled><fingerprint>5d8685ad</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/MyBJiMhSYAE/s41467-018-03558-5</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;, Published online: 22 March 2018;

Background &lt;p&gt;Paraquat (PQ) poisoning can cause multiple organ failure, in which the lung is the primary target organ. There is currently no treatment for PQ poisoning. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which differentiate into multiple cell types, have generated much enthusiasm regarding their use for the treatment of several diseases. The aim of this study was to systematically review and analyze published preclinical studies describing MSC administration for the treatment of PQ poisoning in animal models to provide a basis for cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The electronic databases PubMed and CBMdisc were searched in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The MSC treatment characteristics of animal models of PQ poisoning were summarized. After quality assessment was performed, the effects of MSC transplantation were evaluated based on the survival rate, lung wet/dry weight, fibrosis scores, oxidative stress response, and inflammatory response. Publication bias was assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eleven controlled preclinical studies involving MSC transplantation in animal models of PQ poisoning were included in this review. MSC therapy improved the survival rate and reduced the lung wet/dry weight and histopathological fibrosis changes in most studies. MSCs decreased serum or plasma malondialdehyde levels in the acute phase after 7 and 14 d and increased serum or plasma superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels at the same time points. IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels in blood or lung tissues were decreased to different degrees by MSCs. Lung hydroxyproline was decreased by MSCs after 14 d. No obvious evidence of publication bias was found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;MSCs showed anti-fibrosis therapeutic effects in animal models of lung injury caused by PQ poisoning, which may be related to reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine levels. Our review indicates a potential therapeutic role for MSC therapy to treat PQ poisoning and serves to augment the rationale for clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Fang He</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194748</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b0:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>3cf41838</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fang He, Aiting Zhou, Shou Feng, Yuxiang Li, Tao Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Publication bias was assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eleven controlled preclinical studies involving MSC transplantation in animal models of PQ poisoning were included in this review. MSC therapy improved the survival rate and reduced the lung wet/dry weight and histopathological fibrosis changes in most studies. MSCs decreased serum or plasma malondialdehyde levels in the acute phase after 7 and 14 d and increased serum or plasma superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels at the same time points. IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels in blood or lung tissues were decreased to different degrees by MSCs. Lung hydroxyproline was decreased by MSCs after 14 d. No obvious evidence of publication bias was found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;MSCs showed anti-fibrosis therapeutic effects in animal models of lung injury caused by PQ poisoning, which may be related to reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine levels. Our review indicates a potential therapeutic role for MSC therapy to treat PQ poisoning and serves to augment the rationale for clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for paraquat poisoning: A systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-m?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-m?rss=1</link><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522345097000</published><author><name>Ash, C.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1480.13.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c75:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-m?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>28129e04</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Medicine, Diseases</item></keywords><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Iron&apos;s grip on malaria</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194659</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194659</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194659</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dick van Oevelen, Christina E.

The cold-water coral &lt;i&gt;Lophelia pertusa&lt;/i&gt; is an ecosystem engineer that builds reef structures on the seafloor. The interaction of the reef topography with hydrodynamics is known to enhance the supply of suspended food sources to the reef communities. However, the reef framework is also a substrate for other organisms that may compete for the very same suspended food sources. Here, we used the passive suspension feeder &lt;i&gt;Lophelia pertusa&lt;/i&gt; and the active suspension feeding sponge &lt;i&gt;Hymedesmia coriacea&lt;/i&gt; as model organisms to study niche overlap using isotopically-enriched algae and bacteria as suspended food sources. The coral and the sponge were fed with a combination of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-enriched bacteria/&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-enriched algae or &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-enriched bacteria/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-enriched algae, which was subsequently traced into bulk tissue, coral skeleton and dissolved inorganic carbon (i.e. respiration). Both the coral and the sponge assimilated and respired the suspended bacteria and algae, indicating niche overlap between these species. The assimilation rates of C and N into bulk tissue of specimens incubated separately were not significantly different from assimilation rates during incubations with co-occurring corals and sponges. Hence, no evidence for exploitative resource competition was found, but this is likely due to the saturating experimental food concentration that was used. We do not rule out that exploitative competition occurs in nature during periods of low food concentrations. Food assimilation and respiration rates of the sponge were almost an order of magnitude higher than those of the cold-water coral. We hypothesize that the active suspension feeding mode of the sponge explains the observed differences in resource uptake as opposed to the passive suspension feeding mode of the cold-water coral. These feeding mode differences may set constraints on suitable habitats for cold-water corals and sponges in their natural habitats.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Dick van Oevelen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194659</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5ee:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>88bebd50</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dick van Oevelen, Christina E.

TDP-43 is an ubiquitous and highly conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in several cellular processes including pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, mRNA stability and transport. Notwithstanding the evidence of TDP-43 involvement in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative disorders (i.e. ALS and FTLD), the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Given the high degree of functional similarity between the human and fly orthologs of TDP-43, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; is a simple and useful model to study the pathophysiological role of this protein &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. It has been demonstrated that the depletion of the TDP-43 fly ortholog (tbph) induces deficient locomotive behaviors and reduces life span and anatomical defects at the neuromuscular junction. In this study, using the known binding specificity of TDP-43/tbph for (UG) repeated sequences, we performed a bioinformatic screening for fly genes with at least 6 (TG) repeats in a row within the 3&apos;-UTR regions in order to identify the genes that might be regulated by this factor. Among these genes, we were able to identify RhoGAPp190 as a potential target of the tbph-mediated neurodegeneration. RhoGAPp190 is a negative regulator of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; RhoA, a GTPase protein implicated in the fine modulation of critical cellular processes including axon branch stability and motor axon defasciculation at muscle level and cognitive processes. We were able to demonstrate that the RhoGAPp190 expression is upregulated in a tbph-null fly model, providing evidence that this deregulation is associated to tbph silencing. Our results introduce RhoGAPp190 as a novel potential mediator in the complex scenario of events resulting from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tbph loss-of-function.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Simona Langellotti</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793632:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>886166b2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Simona Langellotti, Giulia Romano, Fabian Feiguin, Francisco Ernesto Baralle, Maurizio Romano&lt;/p&gt;

There is a suspected but unproven association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mental health. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and subjective stress, depressive disorders, health-related quality of life (QoL) and suicide. We selected 124,205 adults from the Korean Community Health Survey in 2013 who were at least 19 years old and who had lived in their current domiciles for &gt; five years. Based on the computer-assisted personal interviews to measure subjective stress in daily life, EuroQoL-5 dimensions, depression diagnosis by a doctor, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts, we evaluated the risk of mental disorders using multiple logistic regression analysis according to the quartiles of air pollutants, such as particulate matter &amp;lt;10μm (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide, using yearly average concentration between August 2012 and July 2013. The prevalence of high stress, poor QoL, depressiveness, diagnosis of depression, and suicide ideation was positively associated with high concentrations of PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO after adjusting for confounding factors. Men were at increased risk of stress, poor QoL, and depressiveness from air pollution exposure than were women. The risk of higher stress or poor QoL in subjects &amp;lt; age 65 increased with air pollution more than did that in subjects ≥ age 65. Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution may be an independent risk factor for mental health disorders ranging from subjective stress to suicide ideation.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Jinyoung Shin</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195607</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529c:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>ee5a65b4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinyoung Shin, Jin Young Park, Jaekyung Choi&lt;/p&gt;

Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution may be an independent risk factor for mental health disorders ranging from subjective stress to suicide ideation.</description><published>1523307600000</published><title>Long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and mental health status: A nationwide population-based cross-sectional study</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23786-5</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23786-5</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/hgSq8JGHrxk/s41598-018-23786-5</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supervised Learning Classifiers for Electrical Impedance-based Bladder State Detection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supervised Learning Classifiers for Electrical Impedance-based Bladder State Detection, Published online: 29 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23786-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23786-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Supervised Learning Classifiers for Electrical Impedance-based Bladder State Detection&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/hgSq8JGHrxk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>243</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23786-5/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23786_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Eoghan Dunne</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23786-5</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162710fdea9:7193cb3:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522315288233</crawled><fingerprint>cf5b8e2c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supervised Learning Classifiers for Electrical Impedance-based Bladder State Detection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supervised Learning Classifiers for Electrical Impedance-based Bladder State Detection, Published online: 29 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23786-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23786-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Supervised Learning Classifiers for Electrical Impedance-based Bladder State Detection&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/hgSq8JGHrxk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1522306800000</published><title>Supervised Learning Classifiers for Electrical Impedance-based Bladder State Detection</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23661-3</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23661-3</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/PDX6mSh_Ij0/s41598-018-23661-3</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bilateral geochemical asymmetry in the Karoo large igneous province&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bilateral geochemical asymmetry in the Karoo large igneous province, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23661-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23661-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Bilateral geochemical asymmetry in the Karoo large igneous province&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/PDX6mSh_Ij0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>403</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23661-3/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23661_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Arto V.

Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensing protein that regulates the function of a large number of proteins, thus playing a crucial part in many cell signaling pathways. CaM has the ability to bind more than 300 different target peptides in a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner, mainly through the exposure of hydrophobic residues. How CaM can bind a large number of targets while retaining some selectivity is a fascinating open question. Here, we explore the mechanism of CaM selective promiscuity for selected target proteins. Analyzing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free CaM via spectral clustering has allowed us to identify distinct conformational states, characterized by interhelical angles, secondary structure determinants and the solvent exposure of specific residues. We searched for indicators of conformational selection by mapping solvent exposure of residues in these conformational states to contacts in structures of CaM/target peptide complexes. We thereby identified CaM states involved in various binding classes arranged along a depth binding gradient. Binding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modifies the accessible hydrophobic surface of the two lobes and allows for deeper binding. Apo CaM indeed shows shallow binding involving predominantly polar and charged residues. Furthermore, binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM appears selective and involves specific conformational states that can facilitate deep binding to target proteins, while binding to the N-terminal lobe appears to happen through a more flexible mechanism. Thus the long-ranged electrostatic interactions of the charged residues of the N-terminal lobe of CaM may initiate binding, while the short-ranged interactions of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM may account for selectivity. This work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nnr4XNya7Zs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006072</href></item></canonical><engagement>1</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006072</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1628c98f9e7:49040:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522777258471</crawled><fingerprint>2a2f00b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Annie M.

This work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nnr4XNya7Zs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1522787045837</recrawled><published>1522789200000</published><title>Effect of Ca&amp;lt;sup&gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&gt; on the promiscuous target-protein binding of calmodulin</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3410.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3410.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3410.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Ongoing climate warming has been demonstrated to impact the cryosphere in the Indian Himalayas, with substantial consequences for the risk of disasters, human well-being, and terrestrial ecosystems.

Background &lt;p&gt;In parturients with increased physiologically intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and a short stature, a greater cephalad spread of spinal anesthesia is often observed after a fixed amount of plain bupivacaine is administered. Therefore, we designed this prospective study to test whether IAP and vertebral column length (VCL) were predictors of spinal spread in parturients undergoing a cesarean section.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 113 parturients, all undergoing elective cesarean sections with single-shot spinal anesthesia, were enrolled. The L3-L4 interspace was entered, and 2 mL of 0.5% plain bupivacaine was injected into the subarachnoid space. Upon loss of temperature sensation at the T4 level, IAP was measured through a bladder catheter while the patient was in the supine position with a 10°left lateral tilt. Parturient demographic variables, including age, height, weight, IAP, and VCL were recorded. Linear regressions and multiple regressions were performed to analyze the relationships between parturient variables and the spread of spinal anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 109 parturients were included in the analysis. Linear regression analysis showed a significant univariate correlation of height, weight, body mass index (BMI), IAP, and VCL with cephalad spread (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt; 0.004). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that IAP and VCL were the key determinants of spinal spread (both &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), where as exclusion of age, weight, and height did not change the result (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt; 0.209).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our data indicated that IAP and VCL were significant predictors of intrathecal spread of plain bupivacaine, and there was a positive association between IAP and abdominal girth in term parturients.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Ting-ting Ni</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195137</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5a:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>e2e14759</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ting-ting Ni, Ying Zhou, An-cui Yong, Lu Wang, Qing-he Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an incurable and rare hereditary syndrome. In recent times, treatment with glucocorticoid analogues has been shown to improve the neurological symptoms that characterize this condition, but the molecular mechanism of action of these analogues remains unknown. Hence, the aim of this study was to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of action of glucocorticoid analogues in the treatment of A-T by investigating the role of Dexamethasone (Dexa) in A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines. We used 2DE and tandem MS to identify proteins that were influenced by the drug in A-T cells but not in healthy cells. Thirty-four proteins were defined out of a total of 746±63. Transcriptome analysis was performed by microarray and showed the differential expression of 599 A-T and 362 wild type (WT) genes and a healthy un-matching between protein abundance and the corresponding gene expression variation. The proteomic and transcriptomic profiles allowed the network pathway analysis to pinpoint the biological and molecular functions affected by Dexamethasone in Dexa-treated cells. The present integrated study provides evidence of the molecular mechanism of action of Dexamethasone in an A-T cellular model but also the broader effects of the drug in other tested cell lines.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Michele Menotta</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195388</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76938:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>622b1adb</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michele Menotta, Sara Orazi, Anna Maria Gioacchini, Chiara Spapperi, Anastasia Ricci, Luciana Chessa, Mauro Magnani&lt;/p&gt;

Chile pepper (&lt;i&gt;Capsicum annuum&lt;/i&gt;) is an important high valued crop worldwide, and when grown on a large scale has problems with weeds. One important herbicide used is glyphosate. Glyphosate inactivates the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (&lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt;), a key enzyme in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids. A transgenic approach towards making glyphosate resistant plants, entails introducing copies of a gene encoding for glyphosate-resistant EPSPS enzyme into the plant. The main objective of our work was to use an intragenic approach to confer resistance to glyphosate in chile which would require using only chile genes for transformation including the selectable marker. Tobacco was used as the transgenic system to identify different gene constructs that would allow for the development of the intragenic system for chile, since chile transformation is inefficient. An &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene was isolated from chile and mutagenized to introduce substitutions that are known to make the encoded enzyme resistant to glyphosate. The promoter for &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene was isolated from chile and the mutagenized chile &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; cDNA was engineered behind both the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter and the &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; promoter. The leaves from the transformants were checked for resistance to glyphosate using a cut leaf assay. In tobacco, though both gene constructs exhibited some degree of resistance to glyphosate, the construct with the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter was more effective and as such chile was transformed with this gene construct. The chile transformants showed resistance to low concentrations of glyphosate. Furthermore, preliminary studies showed that the mutated &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene driven by the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter could be used as a selectable marker for transformation. We have shown that an intragenic approach can be used to confer glyphosate-resistance in chile. However, we need a stronger chile promoter and a mutated chile gene that encodes for a more glyphosate resistant EPSPS protein.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Jose Luis Ortega</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194666</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc712a:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>1b2d4174</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jose Luis Ortega, Wathsala Rajapakse, Suman Bagga, Kimberly Apodaca, Yvonne Lucero, Champa Sengupta-Gopalan&lt;/p&gt;

The Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), &lt;i&gt;Ceratitis capitata&lt;/i&gt; (Wiedemann), is a key pest of fruit crops in many tropical, subtropical and mild temperate areas worldwide. The economic importance of this fruit fly is increasing due to its invasion of new geographical areas. Efficient control and eradication efforts require adequate information regarding &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; adults in relation to environmental and physiological cues. This would allow effective characterisation of the population spatio-temporal dynamic of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; population at both the orchard level and the area-wide landscape.
The aim of this study was to analyse population patterns of adult medflies caught using two trapping systems in a peach orchard located in central Italy. They were differentiated by adult sex (males or females) and mating status of females (unmated or mated females) to determine the spatio-temporal dynamic and evaluate the effect of cultivar and chemical treatments on trap catches. Female mating status was assessed by spermathecal dissection and a blind test was carried out to evaluate the reliability of the technique. Geostatistical methods, variogram and kriging, were used to produce distributional maps. Results showed a strong correlation between the distribution of males and unmated females, whereas males versus mated females and unmated females versus mated females showed a lower correlation. Both cultivar and chemical treatments had significant effects on trap catches, showing associations with sex and female mating status. Medfly adults showed aggregated distributions in the experimental field, but hot spots locations varied. The spatial pattern of unmated females reflected that of males, whereas mated females were largely distributed around ripening or ripe fruit. The results give relevant insights into pest management. Mated females may be distributed differently to unmated females and the identification of male hot spots through monitoring would allow localisation of virgin female populations. Based on our results, a more precise IPM strategy, coupled with effective sanitation practices, could represent a more effective approach to medfly control.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Andrea Sciarretta</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195097</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575ee:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>9bff587c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Sciarretta, Maria Rosaria Tabilio, Elena Lampazzi, Claudio Ceccaroli, Marco Colacci, Pasquale Trematerra&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To establish reference values for hand grip strength (HGS) in a healthy Korean population and to identify the dependent anthropometric variables that affect HGS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Based on the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2014 to 2015, we analyzed the HGS data of 7,969 South Koreans. Individuals with specific chronic diseases and who reported poor subjective health status were excluded to ensure a healthy population sample. Means with standard deviations (SDs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each 5-year interval starting from 10 years of age. To determine the relationship between HGS and anthropometric variables, we performed correlation analyses between HGS and height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Additionally, based on these findings, the cut-off value for low HGS was presented by deriving -2SD values of healthy young adults as recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean age and BMI of men and women were 38.3 and 38.2 years and 23.8 and 22.4 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Mean HGS of the dominant hand in men and women was 39.5 and 24.2 kg, respectively. The peak in HGS was at 35–39 years of age, after which HGS decreased in both sexes. HGS was significantly correlated with height, weight, and BMI. The cut-off values for weak HGS were &amp;lt; 28.9 and &amp;lt; 16.8 kg in men and women, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results provide useful reference values to assess HGS in patients who undergo hand surgery or who have various diseases that affect HGS.

I can state as a fact that the first time I heard a joking reference to his attitude towards traditional synthetic organic chemistry was in the summer of 1983, so it’s not like he’s been keeping his thoughts bottled up. But this is certainly a good summary of them, and here’s the key question that’s being asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The ability to put together molecules – bit‐by‐bit, simple or complex – is one of chemistry’s great accomplishments, and a source of amazement to those in many other fields of science. More than one physicist has told me that s/he cannot believe that it is possible to manipulate bonds between individual atoms with the skill that organic chemists do. When I look at a complex structure assembled in a beautifully organized campaign, I also am amazed. That said, all fields of science morph with time. The phrase “organic synthesis” has come to mean “synthesis of structurally complex natural products”, or, perhaps, “synthesis of complicated molecules with pharmaceutical activity.” Nature, and relevance to healthcare, define the targets, and provide the utilitarian justification for the effort. Is there (or should there be) more to it than that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsidiary questions are whether organic synthesis of that sort is worth the effort that’s being put into it and whether it trains students to do useful things and whether other types of work could do a better job of that. In order to address these, Whitesides notes, we have to make sure that we’re talking about the same things. He defines “organic synthesis” (small letters) as any sort of putting-together-of-organic molecules, and “Organic Synthesis” (with the capitals) as the sort of complex and often natural-product-based synthesis practiced by R. B. Woodward, his contemporaries, and his intellectual heirs. The latter is what many people mean by those two words, to be sure, and Whitesides has some questions about just what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the field a science that generates new concepts and new theory? Is it instead more of an art form, driven at least partly by aesthetic choices (that can be appreciated by skilled observers) rather than utility &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;? Or is it something of a craft, achieving its results (in the end) through skilled empirical tinkering? These questions, especially in the way that they’re phrased, are likely to cause intense annoyance in some practitioners. But I think that the annoyance is a sign that these categories are uncomfortably plausible and recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the field partakes of all of these characteristics, but on what proportions? I think that the science/craft distinction is actually one question, and that these are on the same scale with opposite signs: the more solid the theoretical framework, the less Edisonian tinkering. My opinion is toward the Edisonian end. Organic synthesis is not bereft of theories and organizing concepts, but they do not operate strongly enough (that is, in a detailed enough fashion) to allow us to predict (for example) reaction conditions. That’s why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. The same goes for predicting new reactions, which is why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/11/24/reaction_discovery_reviewed&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. No one sat down a few decades ago and said “Y’know, my knowledge of organometallic chemistry allows me to predict that palladium, in particular, will show oxidative addition/reductive elimination behavior that will be spectacularly useful in carbon-carbon bond formation. And while I’m making bold predictions, you might try aryl boronic acids for that reaction first, even though hardly any such things have even been described”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for art, I would very much like to have a dollar for every total-synthesis person who has talked about the field in terms of its artistic qualities. We have Woodward to thank for this – the man was a &lt;em&gt;tremendous&lt;/em&gt; scientist, but his influence has &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/07/22/woodwards-prose-style&quot;&gt;not always been&lt;/a&gt; for the good. I don’t think nearly as many people went into spasms about elegance and beauty in reference to total synthesis before him, and what’s more annoying is that those are valid concepts to apply even if Woodward sometimes came across like an Aubrey Beardsley aesthete about them. My own view is that we should let the artistic qualities of organic synthesis, which exist, speak for themselves. Because if they can’t, no amount of &lt;em&gt;raffiniert&lt;/em&gt; gushing about them will substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitesides isn’t through. That three-parter is just his first of three questions! The second one is a two-parter: is organic synthesis best thought of as an enabling technology to do things (such as make drugs, etc.) or as a framework that lets us ask questions about the nature of molecules and their behavior? That is, are the uses to which we put this field, and the justifications we give for it, best described as practical ones or intellectual ones? We tend to haul out the former first and start talking in better-living-through-(organic)-chemistry style, and that’s understandable. Compounds made through organic synthesis, and available through no other practical means, are crucial underpinnings of the modern world. If we’re not proud of that, what are we to be proud of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that second justification, while it sounds like more aesthetic hand-waving to the lay public (and to funding agencies), has some staying power. Ask the physicists, or even the mathematicians. Asking fundamental questions, and having the right framework in which to be able to ask them, can pay off hugely even from the practical end, intellectual satisfaction aside. There’s a lot of number theory that was just another ornament of mathematics until it became vital for modern cryptography and secure communications (G. H. Hardy would have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2IK9D0o&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;horrified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Relativity was a fantastic intellectual feat by Einstein, but relativistic corrections are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html&quot;&gt;needed&lt;/a&gt; to make the GPS system work correctly, among many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third question is, what should we teach chemistry students about the field? That is, what are the most important things for them to know? There’s a massive pile of empirical knowledge, famously dreaded by sophomores, but it’s taught (or should be!) according to general organizing principles – although those are the very ones that are not quite adequate enough to explain everything that’s going on. At what level should we teach this subject? You can say “Here are reactions that depend on alpha-carbonyl anions, and here’s why they happen”, you can say “Time to learn the difference between the Dieckmann and Claisen condensations”, or “Here are the kinds of products these reactions form and what they’re used for”, or “Here are some tips on how to run these things at the bench”, and on and on. What should be in the syllabus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own take on this is that there should definitely be a bias towards the general principles, which is what the better organic chemistry professors already do. Teaching the subject as a pile of reactions is a crime. I may be too loose about this stuff, but I would rather a student, if it came down to it, mess up a bit on the detailed mechanism of the Mitsunobu reaction if they understand that its driving force is the thermodynamic sink of triphenylphosphine oxide formation. The difference between the Dieckmann and the Claisen condensations is that the former is intramolecular and the latter is intermolecular, but I think it’s a waste of brain space to give them different names and memorize them as such. I would much rather that a student, in this case, immediately recognize the mechanism of an alpha-carbonyl anion attacking an ester carbonyl (no matter what the name associated with that process is) and recognize the influence of the leaving group of the ester, the stability vs. reactivity characteristics of the nucleophile, the likelihood of the various ring sizes being formed in the intramolecular reaction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nowhere near exhausted the Annoying Questions of George Whitesides, but this post is long enough as it is!

Early diagnosis is critical for individuals with Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) in clinical practice because its progress is irreversible. In the existing literature, support vector machine (SVM) has always been applied to distinguish between AD and healthy controls (HC) based on neuroimaging data. But previous studies have only used a single SVM to classify AD and HC, and the accuracy is not very high and generally less than 90%. The method of random support vector machine cluster was proposed to classify AD and HC in this paper. From the Alzheimer&apos;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the subjects including 25 AD individuals and 35 HC individuals were obtained. The classification accuracy could reach to 94.44% in the results. Furthermore, the method could also be used for feature selection and the accuracy could be maintained at the level of 94.44%. In addition, we could also find out abnormal brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and cingulate cortex). It is worth noting that the proposed random support vector machine cluster could be a new insight to help the diagnosis of AD.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Xia-an Bi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194479</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51ca:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>5f2d5fed</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xia-an Bi, Qing Shu, Qi Sun, Qian Xu&lt;/p&gt;

But previous studies have only used a single SVM to classify AD and HC, and the accuracy is not very high and generally less than 90%. The method of random support vector machine cluster was proposed to classify AD and HC in this paper. From the Alzheimer&apos;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the subjects including 25 AD individuals and 35 HC individuals were obtained. The classification accuracy could reach to 94.44% in the results. Furthermore, the method could also be used for feature selection and the accuracy could be maintained at the level of 94.44%. In addition, we could also find out abnormal brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and cingulate cortex). It is worth noting that the proposed random support vector machine cluster could be a new insight to help the diagnosis of AD.</description><published>1521838800000</published><title>Random support vector machine cluster analysis of resting-state fMRI in Alzheimer&apos;s disease</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00042</originId><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00042</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00042</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522728000000</published><author><name>Abhishek Parija, Yun-Hyuk Choi, Zhuotong Liu, Justin L.

In health sector, trust is considered important because it indirectly influences the quality of health care through patient satisfaction, adherence and the continuity of its relationship with health care professionals and the promotion of accurate and timely diagnoses. One of the important requirements of TRSs in the health sector is rating secrecy, which mandates that the identification information about the service consumer should be kept secret to prevent any privacy violation. Anonymity and trust are two imperative objectives, and no significant explicit efforts have been made to achieve both of them at the same time. In this paper, we present a framework for solving the problem of reconciling trust with anonymity in the health sector. Our solution comprises Anonymous &lt;i&gt;Reputation Management&lt;/i&gt; (ARM) protocol and &lt;i&gt;Context-aware Trustworthiness Assessment&lt;/i&gt; (CTA) protocol. ARM protocol ensures that only those service consumers who received a service from a specific service provider provide a recommendation score anonymously with in the specified time limit. The CTA protocol computes the reputation of a user as a service provider and as a recommender. To determine the correctness of the proposed ARM protocol, formal modelling and verification are performed using High Level Petri Nets (HLPN) and Z3 Solver. Our simulation results verify the accuracy of the proposed context-aware trust assessment scheme.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Farhana Jabeen</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7132:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>4913f262</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Farhana Jabeen, Zara Hamid, Wadood Abdul, Sanaa Ghouzali, Abid Khan, Saif Ur Rehman Malik, Mansoor Shaukat Khan, Sarfraz Nawaz&lt;/p&gt;

Phycobilisomes (PBS) are accessory light harvesting protein complexes formed mainly by phycobiliproteins (PBPs). The PBPs absorb light that is efficiently transferred to Photosystems due to chromophores covalently bound to specific cysteine residues. Besides phycobiliproteins (PE), the PBS contains linker proteins responsible for assembly and stabilization of the whole complex and the tuning of energy transfer steps between chromophores. The linker (γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;) from &lt;i&gt;Gracilaria chilensis&lt;/i&gt;, is a chromophorylated rod linker associated to (αβ)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; hexamers of R-phycoerythrin (R-PE). Its role in the energy transfer process is not clear yet. Structural studies as well as the composition and location of the chromophores are essential to understand their involvement in the energy transfer process in PBS. To achieve this, the coding gene of γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was analyzed by informatics tools, to obtain preliminary information which leaded the next experiments. The protein was purified from R-phycoerythrin, and the sequence confirmed by mass spectrometry. The coding sequence analysis revealed a protein of 318 aminoacid residues containing a chloroplastidial transit peptide (cTP) of 39 aminoacids at the N-terminus. The conservation of cysteines revealed possible chromophorylation sites. Using α and β R-PE subunits as spectroscopic probes in denaturation assays, we deduced a double bonded phycourobilin (PUB) on γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; subunit that were confirmed between Cys62 and Cys73 (DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;62/73&lt;/sup&gt;) by mass spectrometry. The cysteines involved in the double link are located in a helical region, in a conformation that reminds the position of the DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;50/61&lt;/sup&gt; in the β subunit of R-PE. The position of single linked PUB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt; and a single linked PEB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; were also confirmed.

We investigated the numbers of planktonic and biofilm cells and the expression levels of genes encoding efflux pumps and biofilm-related proteins in 10 clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; (MDRA) as well as in its standard strain ATCC 19606 in the presence of colistin (CST), polymyxin B (PMB), minomycin (MIN), and tigecycline (TGC) at their respective sub-MICs. The number of planktonic and biofilm cells of ATCC 19606 decreased in the presence of all aforementioned antibiotics in a dose-dependent manner. Cell number also decreased in two representative MDRA strains, R2 and R3, in the presence of MIN and TGC in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the number of biofilm cells in these two strains increased in the presence of CST, while they increased significantly in the presence of PMB in R2 only. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the number of biofilm cells was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding efflux pumps (&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;) and autoinducer synthase (&lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt;) in strain R2 and &lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeJ&lt;/i&gt;, poly-acetyl-glucosamine-porin (&lt;i&gt;pgaA&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt; in strain R3 in the presence of CST. It was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding &lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; in strain R2 and an outer membrane protein A (&lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt;) and biofilm-associated protein (&lt;i&gt;bap)&lt;/i&gt; in strain R3 in the presence of PMB. These results provide valuable insights into the biofilm formation potency of clinical isolates of MDRA that depends on efflux pumps and biofilm-related genes and its regulation by antibiotics.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Yoshinori Sato</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194556</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88ff:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>5756cd68</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoshinori Sato, Yuka Unno, Tsuneyuki Ubagai, Yasuo Ono&lt;/p&gt;

Living animal cells are strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of their environment. To model physiological conditions ultrasoft cell culture substrates, in some instances with elasticity (Young&apos;s modulus) of only 1 kPa, are mandatory. Due to their long shelf life PDMS-based elastomers are a popular choice. However, uncertainty about additives in commercial formulations and difficulties to reach very soft materials limit their use. Here, we produced silicone elastomers from few, chemically defined and commercially available substances. Elastomers exhibited elasticities in the range from 1 kPa to 55 kPa. In detail, a high molecular weight (155 kg/mol), vinyl-terminated linear silicone was crosslinked with a multifunctional (f = 51) crosslinker (a copolymer of dimethyl siloxane and hydrosilane) by a platinum catalyst. The following different strategies towards ultrasoft materials were explored: sparse crosslinking, swelling with inert silicone polymers, and, finally, deliberate introduction of dangling ends into the network (inhibition). Rheological experiments with very low frequencies led to precise viscoelastic characterizations. All strategies enabled tuning of stiffness with the lowest stiffness of ~1 kPa reached by inhibition.

Open-cut coal mining in Queensland results in the formation of extensive saline overburden spoil-piles with steep slopes at the angle of repose (approximately 75% or 37&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;). These spoil-piles are generally found in multiple rows, several kilometers in length and heights of up to 50 or 60 m above the original landscape. They are highly dispersive and erodible. Legislation demands that these spoil piles be rehabilitated to minimize on-site and off-site discharges of sediment and salt into the surrounding environment. To achieve this, the steep slopes must be reduced, stabilized against erosion, covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. Key design criteria (slope gradient, slope length and vegetation cover) are required for the construction of post-mining landscapes that will result in acceptable erosion rates.
A novel user-friendly hillslope computer model MINErosion 3.4 was developed that can accurately predict potential erosion rates from field scale hillslopes using parameters measured with a 3m laboratory tilting flume-rainfall simulator or using routinely measured soil physical and chemical properties. This model links MINErosion 2 with a novel consolidation and above ground vegetation cover factors, to the RUSLE and MUSLE equations to predict the mean annual and storm event erosion rates. The RUSLE-based prediction of the mean annual erosion rates allow minesites to derive the key design criteria of slope length, slope gradient and vegetation cover that would lead to acceptable erosion rates. The MUSLE-based prediction of storm event erosion rates will be useful as input into risk analysis of potential damage from erosion.
MINErosion 3.4 was validated against erosion measured on 20 m field erosion plots established on post-mining landscapes at the Oakey Creek and Curragh coalmines, as well as on 120 and 70 m erosion plots on postmining landscapes at Kidston Gold Mine.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Hwat Bing So</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194230</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2817:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>929e6cd3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hwat Bing So, Ashraf M.

How do we rapidly process incoming streams of information in working memory, a cognitive mechanism central to human behavior? Dominant views of working memory focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but human hippocampal recordings provide a neurophysiological signature distinct from the PFC. Are these regions independent, or do they interact in the service of working memory? We addressed this core issue in behavior by recording directly from frontotemporal sites in humans performing a visuospatial working memory task that operationalizes the types of identity and spatiotemporal information we encounter every day. Theta band oscillations drove bidirectional interactions between the PFC and medial temporal lobe (MTL; including the hippocampus). MTL theta oscillations directed the PFC preferentially during the processing of spatiotemporal information, while PFC theta oscillations directed the MTL for all types of information being processed in working memory. These findings reveal an MTL theta mechanism for processing space and time and a domain-general PFC theta mechanism, providing evidence that rapid, dynamic MTL–PFC interactions underlie working memory for everyday experiences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5Z-HrtFgn-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004274</href></item></canonical><engagement>7</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004274</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16277feec6e:11ab9b:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522431618158</crawled><fingerprint>5d873c0a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth L.

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have remarkable properties: they represent the most abundant cycling cell population in the adult normal brain and they manage to achieve a uniform and constant density throughout the adult brain. This equilibrium is obtained by the interplay of four processes: division, differentiation or death, migration and active self-repulsion. They are also strongly suspected to be at the origin of gliomas, when their equilibrium is disrupted. In this article, we present a model of the dynamics of OPCs, first in a normal tissue. This model is based on a cellular automaton and its rules are mimicking the ones that regulate the dynamics of real OPCs. The model is able to reproduce the homeostasis of the cell population, with the maintenance of a constant and uniform cell density and the healing of a lesion. We show that there exists a fair quantitative agreement between the simulated and experimental parameters, such as the cell velocity, the time taken to close a lesion, and the duration of the cell cycle. We present three possible scenarios of disruption of the equilibrium: the appearance of an over-proliferating cell, of a deadless/non-differentiating cell, or of a cell that lost any contact-inhibition. We show that the appearance of an over-proliferating cell is sufficient to trigger the growth of a tumor that has low-grade glioma features: an invasive behaviour, a linear radial growth of the tumor with a corresponding growth velocity of less than 2 mm per year, as well a cell density at the center which exceeds the one in normal tissue by a factor of less than two. The loss of contact inhibition leads to a more high-grade-like glioma. The results of our model contribute to the body of evidence that identify OPCs as possible cells of origin of gliomas.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4yhFdqGpIbo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005977</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005977</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1626db49d71:41fee1:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1522258976113</crawled><fingerprint>cce1b876</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aloys Dufour, Emilie Gontran, Christophe Deroulers, Pascale Varlet, Johan Pallud, Basile Grammaticos, Mathilde Badoual&lt;/p&gt;

Based on extensive Langevin Dynamics simulations we investigate the structural properties of a two-dimensional ensemble of magnetic rods with a peapod-like morphology, i.e, rods consisting of aligned single dipolar beads. Self-assembled configurations are studied for different directions of the dipole with respect to the rod axis. We found that with increasing misalignment of the dipole from the rod axis, the smaller the packing fraction at which the percolation transition is found. For the same density, the system exhibits different aggregation states for different misalignment. We also study the stability of the percolated structures with respect to temperature, which is found to be affected by the microstructure of the assembly of rods.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Jorge L.

The microtubule associated protein tau plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that tau also plays a role in disorders of neuronal connectivity, including epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. Animal studies have shown that the MAPT gene, which codes for the tau protein, undergoes complex pre-mRNA alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms during brain development. Human data, particularly on temporal and regional variation in tau splicing during development are however lacking. In this study, we present the first detailed examination of the temporal and regional sequence of MAPT alternative splicing in the developing human brain. We used a novel computational analysis of large transcriptomic datasets (total n = 502 patients), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting to examine tau expression and splicing in post-mortem human fetal, pediatric and adult brains. We found that MAPT exons 2 and 10 undergo abrupt shifts in expression during the perinatal period that are unique in the canonical human microtubule-associated protein family, while exon 3 showed small but significant temporal variation. Tau isoform expression may be a marker of neuronal maturation, temporally correlated with the onset of axonal growth. Immature brain regions such as the ganglionic eminence and rhombic lip had very low tau expression, but within more mature regions, there was little variation in tau expression or splicing.

The microtubule associated protein tau plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that tau also plays a role in disorders of neuronal connectivity, including epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. Animal studies have shown that the MAPT gene, which codes for the tau protein, undergoes complex pre-mRNA alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms during brain development. Human data, particularly on temporal and regional variation in tau splicing during development are however lacking. In this study, we present the first detailed examination of the temporal and regional sequence of MAPT alternative splicing in the developing human brain. We used a novel computational analysis of large transcriptomic datasets (total n = 502 patients), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting to examine tau expression and splicing in post-mortem human fetal, pediatric and adult brains. We found that MAPT exons 2 and 10 undergo abrupt shifts in expression during the perinatal period that are unique in the canonical human microtubule-associated protein family, while exon 3 showed small but significant temporal variation. Tau isoform expression may be a marker of neuronal maturation, temporally correlated with the onset of axonal growth. Immature brain regions such as the ganglionic eminence and rhombic lip had very low tau expression, but within more mature regions, there was little variation in tau expression or splicing. We thus demonstrate an abrupt, evolutionarily conserved shift in tau isoform expression during the human perinatal period that may be due to tau expression in maturing neurons. Alternative splicing of the &lt;i&gt;MAPT&lt;/i&gt; pre-mRNA may play a vital role in normal brain development across multiple species and provides a basis for future investigations into the developmental and pathological functions of the tau protein.</description><published>1523394000000</published><title>High-resolution temporal and regional mapping of &amp;lt;i&gt;MAPT&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression and splicing in human brain development</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256354v2?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256354v2?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256354v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Mapping-based approaches have become limited in their application to very large sets of references since computing an FM-index for very large databases (e.g. &gt; 10 GB) has become a bottleneck.

Investigation of human diet during the Neolithic has often been limited to a few archaeological cultures or single sites. In order to provide insight into the development of human food consumption and husbandry strategies, our study explores bone collagen carbon and nitrogen isotope data from 466 human and 105 faunal individuals from 26 sites in central Germany. It is the most extensive data set to date from an enclosed geographic microregion, covering 4,000 years of agricultural history from the Early Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. The animal data show that a variety of pastures and dietary resources were explored, but that these changed remarkably little over time. In the human &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N however we found a significant increase with time across the different archaeological cultures. This trend could be observed in all time periods and archaeological cultures (Bell Beaker phenomenon excluded), even on continuously populated sites. Since there was no such trend in faunal isotope values, we were able largely to exclude manuring as the cause of this effect. Based on the rich interdisciplinary data from this region and archaeological period we can argue that meat consumption increased with the increasing duration of farming subsistence.

DNA methylation is mediated by a conserved family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). The human genome encodes three active Dnmts (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b), the tRNA methyltransferase Dnmt2, and the regulatory protein Dnmt3L. Despite their high degree of conservation among different species, genes encoding Dnmts have been duplicated and/or lost in multiple lineages throughout evolution, indicating that the DNA methylation machinery has some potential to undergo evolutionary change. However, little is known about the extent to which this machinery, or the methylome, varies among vertebrates. Here, we study the molecular evolution of Dnmt1, the enzyme responsible for maintenance of DNA methylation patterns after replication, in 79 vertebrate species. Our analyses show that all studied species exhibit a single copy of the &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; gene, with the exception of tilapia and marsupials (tammar wallaby, koala, Tasmanian devil and opossum), each of which displays two apparently functional &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; duplicated before the radiation of major marsupial groups (i.e., at least ~75 million years ago), thus giving rise to two &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies in marsupials (copy 1 and copy 2). In the opossum lineage, copy 2 was lost, and copy 1 recently duplicated again, generating three &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies: two putatively functional genes (copy 1a and 1b) and one pseudogene (copy 1ψ). Both marsupial copies (&lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies 1 and 2) are under purifying selection, and copy 2 exhibits elevated rates of evolution and signatures of positive selection, suggesting a scenario of neofunctionalization. This gene duplication might have resulted in modifications in marsupial methylomes and their dynamics.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>David Alvarez-Ponce</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195162</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f45fe:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>22f41d4c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Alvarez-Ponce, María Torres-Sánchez, Felix Feyertag, Asmita Kulkarni, Taylen Nappi&lt;/p&gt;

However, the collection of extended family trees is tedious and usually relies on resources with limited geographical scope and complex data usage restrictions. We collected 86 million profiles from publicly available online data shared by genealogy enthusiasts. After extensive cleaning and validation, we obtained population-scale family trees, including a single pedigree of 13 million individuals. We leveraged the data to partition the genetic architecture of human longevity and to provide insights into the geographical dispersion of families.

Experimental philosophy (x-phi) is a young field of research in the intersection of philosophy and psychology. It aims to make progress on philosophical questions by using experimental methods traditionally associated with the psychological and behavioral sciences, such as null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Motivated by recent discussions about a methodological crisis in the behavioral sciences, questions have been raised about the methodological standards of x-phi. Here, we focus on one aspect of this question, namely the &lt;i&gt;rate of inconsistencies in statistical reporting&lt;/i&gt;. Previous research has examined the extent to which published articles in psychology and other behavioral sciences present statistical inconsistencies in reporting the results of NHST. In this study, we used the R package statcheck to detect statistical inconsistencies in x-phi, and compared rates of inconsistencies in psychology and philosophy. We found that rates of inconsistencies in x-phi are lower than in the psychological and behavioral sciences. From the point of view of statistical reporting consistency, x-phi seems to do no worse, and perhaps even better, than psychological science.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Matteo Colombo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194360</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7129:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>ccf2ae76</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Matteo Colombo, Georgi Duev, Michèle B.

Fungal communities in agricultural soils are assumed to be affected by soil and crop management. Our intention was to investigate the impact of different tillage and fertilization practices on fungal communities in a long-term crop rotation field trial established in 1992 in Central Germany. Two winter wheat fields in replicated strip-tillage design, comprising conventional &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. conservation tillage, intensive &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. extensive fertilization and different pre-crops (maize &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. rapeseed) were analyzed by a metabarcoding approach applying Illumina paired-end sequencing of amplicons generated by two recently developed primer pairs targeting the two fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2). Analysis of 5.1 million high-quality sequence reads uncovered a diverse fungal community in the two fields, composed of 296 fungal genera including 3,398 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at the 97% sequence similarity threshold. Both primer pairs detected the same fungal phyla (&lt;i&gt;Basidio&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Asco&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Zygo&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Glomero&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Chytridiomycota&lt;/i&gt;), but in different relative abundances. OTU richness was higher in the ITS1 dataset, while ITS2 data were more diverse and of higher evenness. Effects of farming practice on fungal community structures were revealed. Almost two-thirds of the fungal genera were represented in all different soil treatments, whereas the remaining genera clearly responded to farming practice. Principal Component Analysis revealed four distinct clusters according to tillage practice and pre-crop. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) substantiated the results and proved significant influences of tillage and pre-crop, while fertilization had the smallest and non-significant effect. In-depth analysis of putative phytopathogenic and plant beneficial fungal groups indicated distinct responses; for example &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; was significantly enriched in the intensively fertilized conservation tillage variants with the pre-crop maize, while &lt;i&gt;Phoma&lt;/i&gt; displayed significant association with conventional tillage and pre-crop rapeseed.

Studies with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically involve generation of gene expression profiles that can be further analyzed, many times involving differential gene expression (DGE). This process enables comparison across samples of two or more factor levels. A recurring issue with DGE analyses is the complicated nature of the comparisons to be made, in which a variety of factor combinations, pairwise comparisons, and main or blocked main effects need to be tested. Results: Here we present a tool called IRIS-DGE, which is a server-based DGE analysis tool developed using Shiny. It provides a straightforward, user-friendly platform for performing comprehensive DGE analysis, and crucial analyses that help design hypotheses and to determine key genomic features.

Studies with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically involve generation of gene expression profiles that can be further analyzed, many times involving differential gene expression (DGE). This process enables comparison across samples of two or more factor levels. A recurring issue with DGE analyses is the complicated nature of the comparisons to be made, in which a variety of factor combinations, pairwise comparisons, and main or blocked main effects need to be tested. Results: Here we present a tool called IRIS-DGE, which is a server-based DGE analysis tool developed using Shiny. It provides a straightforward, user-friendly platform for performing comprehensive DGE analysis, and crucial analyses that help design hypotheses and to determine key genomic features. IRIS-DGE integrates the three most commonly used R-based DGE tools to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and includes numerous methods for performing preliminary analysis on user-provided gene expression information. Additionally, this tool integrates a variety of visualizations, in a highly interactive manner, for improved interpretation of preliminary and DGE analyses.

Numerous peripheral tissues possess self-sustaining daily biologic rhythms that are regulated at the molecular level by clock genes such as &lt;i&gt;PER1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PER2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLOCK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and BMAL1&lt;/i&gt;. Physiological function of nasal mucosa exhibits rhythmic variability to a day-night environmental cycle. Nevertheless, little is known of the expression and distribution pattern of clock genes in nasal mucosa. The present study investigates the expression level and distribution pattern of &lt;i&gt;PER1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PER2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLOCK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and BMAL1&lt;/i&gt; genes in nasal mucosa of healthy controls, allergic rhinitis patients, and normal rats. In human and rat nasal mucosa, the levels of these genes are asymmetrically expressed in nasal mucosa derived from right and left cavities in normal controls, allergic patients, and rat. In human nasal mucosa, the expression levels of these genes were higher in the decongested side than the congested mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, these clock genes are expressed in a rhythmic circadian manner under the regular light/dark cycles. The expression levels of MUC5AC, a key mucin genes produced in superficial epithelium, are higher in decongested side than that congested side in human nasal mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, MUC5AC levels showed a circadian rhythm which was associated with different expression levels in nasal mucosa derived from the right and left nasal cavities. Taken together with these results, the present study shows that the clock genes such as &lt;i&gt;PER1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PER2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLOCK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and BMAL1&lt;/i&gt; are present in human and rat nasal mucosa, and suggest that these clock genes may control the pathophysiological function of nasal mucosa as circadian oscillators and affect the maintenance of the nasal cycle.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Ha Kyun Kim</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194018</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d52:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>1d892074</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ha Kyun Kim, Hyun Jung Kim, Jae Hyung Kim, Tae Hoon Kim, Sang Hag Lee&lt;/p&gt;

The main objective of this work was to quantify and update the U.S. Midwest agricultural state of Iowa’s contribution of nitrate-nitrogen to the Mississippi River stream network against the backdrop of the ongoing problem of Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. To achieve this objective, we used stream nitrate and discharge data collected from 1999 until 2016 at 23 Iowa stream sites near watershed outlets, along with publicly-available data for sites downstream of Iowa on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Our analysis shows that Iowa contributes between 11 and 52% of the long-term nitrate load to the Mississippi-Atchafalaya Basin, 20 to 63% to the Upper Mississippi River Basin, and 20 to 89% to the Missouri River Basin, with averages of 29, 45 and 55% respectively. Since 1999, nitrate loads in the Iowa-inclusive basins have increased and these increases do not appear to be driven by changes in discharge and cropping intensity unique to Iowa. The 5-year running annual average of Iowa nitrate loading has been above the 2003 level for ten consecutive years, implying that Gulf hypoxic areal goals, also based on a 5-year running annual average, will be very difficult to achieve if nitrate retention cannot be improved in Iowa. An opportunity exists for land managers, policy makers and conservationists to manifest a positive effect on water quality by targeting and implementing nitrate reducing-practices in areas like Iowa while avoiding areas that are less likely to affect Gulf of Mexico hypoxia.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Christopher S.

Patient-nominated supporters can potentially improve the continuum of HIV care. We retrospectively determined factors associated with having a patient-nominated supporter among people living with HIV (PLWH), and its association with retention in care and viral suppression. We analysed registries of adults evaluated by social workers (n = 1345) at a referral hospital in Peru between 2011–2014. Nondisclosure of HIV status was associated with lacking supporters (aPR: 5.41, 95% CI: 3.83–7.64). Retention in care was 76.4% and 34.2% after one and two years of enrolment, respectively. PLWH with supporters were more likely to be retained in care after two years (aRR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02–1.81), but not after one year (aRR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.98–1.23) compared to PLWH without supporters. Having supporters who were parents or friends was associated with an increased probability of being retained in care after one and two years of enrolment. Viral suppression after one year of enrolment was 58.7%. Having a supporter was not associated with viral suppression (aRR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.99–1.41), but PLWH with supporters were more likely to have viral load measurements (p = 0.005). Patient-nominated supporters appear beneficial for engagement in HIV care; these benefits may be related to the nature of their relationship with PLWH.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Mateo Prochazka</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195389</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575ff:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>9c6e7c3d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mateo Prochazka, Larissa Otero, Kelika A.

Patient-nominated supporters appear beneficial for engagement in HIV care; these benefits may be related to the nature of their relationship with PLWH.</description><published>1522875600000</published><title>Patient-nominated supporters as facilitators for engagement in HIV care in a referral hospital in Peru: A retrospective cohort study</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1225-a?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1225-a?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1225-a?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521135592000</published><author><name>Braje, T.

Spinal motoneurones (Mns) constitute the final output for the execution of motor tasks. In addition to innervating muscles, Mns project excitatory collateral connections to Renshaw cells (RCs) and other Mns, but the latter have received little attention. We show that Mns receive strong synaptic input from other Mns throughout development and into maturity, with fast-type Mns systematically receiving greater recurrent excitation than slow-type Mns. Optical recordings show that activation of Mns in one spinal segment can propagate to adjacent segments even in the presence of intact recurrent inhibition. While it is known that transmission at the neuromuscular junction is purely cholinergic and RCs are excited through both acetylcholine and glutamate receptors, here we show that neurotransmission between Mns is purely glutamatergic, indicating that synaptic transmission systems are differentiated at different postsynaptic targets of Mns.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8cEYlJIEZjs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003586</href></item></canonical><engagement>1</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003586</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162259eed6a:49391e:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521049595242</crawled><fingerprint>63442c6d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gardave S.

We discuss a novel type of surface soliton—aberrated surface soliton—appearance in a nonlinear one dimensional photonic crystal and a possibility of this surface soliton formation in two dimensional photonic crystal. An aberrated surface soliton possesses a nonlinear distribution of the wavefront. We show that, in one dimensional photonic crystal, the surface soliton is formed at the photonic crystal boundary with the ambient medium. Essentially, that it occupies several layers at the photonic crystal boundary and penetrates into the ambient medium at a distance also equal to several layers, so that one can infer about light energy localization at the lateral surface of the photonic crystal. In the one dimensional case, the surface soliton is formed from an earlier formed soliton that falls along the photonic crystal layers at an angle which differs slightly from the normal to the photonic crystal face. In the two dimensional case, the soliton can appear if an incident Gaussian beam falls on the photonic crystal face. The influence of laser radiation parameters, optical properties of photonic crystal layers and ambient medium on the one dimensional surface soliton formation is investigated. We also discuss the influence of two dimensional photonic crystal configuration on light energy localization near the photonic crystal surface. It is important that aberrated surface solitons can be created at relatively low laser pulse intensity and for close values of alternating layers dielectric permittivity which allows their experimental observation.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Vyacheslav A.

Based on two real datasets about human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we identified 7 DV-only microRNAs (hsa-miR-1826, hsa-miR-191, hsa-miR-194-star, hsa-miR-222, hsa-miR-502-3p, hsa-miR-93, and hsa-miR-99b) using the proposed method, one (hsa-miR-1826) of which has not yet been reported to relate to HCC in the literature.</description><published>1523170800000</published><title>Detecting Differential Variable microRNAs via Model-Based Clustering [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03267-5</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03267-5</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03267-5</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When antibiotics turn toxic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When antibiotics turn toxic, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03267-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03267-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Commonly prescribed drugs called fluoroquinolones cause rare, disabling side effects.

Climate change has been identified as the primary threat to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems in this century, although there is still much uncertainty about its effects and the degree of vulnerability for different ecosystems to this threat. Here we propose a new methodological approach capable of measuring and mapping the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems at large scales based on their climatic niche. To do this, we used high spatial resolution remote sensing data and ecological niche modeling techniques to calculate and spatialize the resilience of three stable states of ecosystems in South America: forest, savanna, and grassland. Also, we evaluated the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate stress, the likelihood of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions, and their respective adaptive capacities in the face of climate change. Our results indicate that forests, the most productive and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on the earth, are more vulnerable to climate change than savannas or grasslands. Forests showed less resistance to climate stress and a higher chance of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions. If this scenario occurs, the forest ecosystems would have less chance of adaptation compared to savannas or grasslands because of their narrow climate niche. Therefore, we can conclude that a possible consolidation of non-analogous climatic conditions would lead to a loss of resilience in the forest ecosystem, significantly increasing the chance of a critical transition event to another stable state with a lower density of vegetation cover (e.g., savanna or grassland).</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Luciano J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Diagnosing HIV and/or TB is not sufficient; linkage to care and treatment is conditional to reduce the burden of disease. This study aimed to determine factors associated with linkage to HIV care and TB treatment at community-based services in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized routinely collected data from clients who utilized stand-alone (fixed site not attached to a health facility) and mobile HIV testing services in eight communities in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan district, between January 2008 and June 2012. Clients were included in the analysis if they were ≥12 years and had a known HIV status. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were used to assess the association between determinants (sex, age, HIV testing service and co-infection status) and self-reported linkage to HIV care and/or TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Linkage to HIV care was 3 738/5 929 (63.1%). Linkage to HIV care was associated with the type of HIV testing service.

Background &lt;p&gt;Diagnosing HIV and/or TB is not sufficient; linkage to care and treatment is conditional to reduce the burden of disease. This study aimed to determine factors associated with linkage to HIV care and TB treatment at community-based services in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized routinely collected data from clients who utilized stand-alone (fixed site not attached to a health facility) and mobile HIV testing services in eight communities in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan district, between January 2008 and June 2012. Clients were included in the analysis if they were ≥12 years and had a known HIV status. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were used to assess the association between determinants (sex, age, HIV testing service and co-infection status) and self-reported linkage to HIV care and/or TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Linkage to HIV care was 3 738/5 929 (63.1%). Linkage to HIV care was associated with the type of HIV testing service. Clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services had a significantly reduced odds of linking to HIV care (aOR 0.7 (CI 95%: 0.6–0.8), p&amp;lt;0.001. Linkage to TB treatment was 210/275 (76.4%).

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) often experience abnormal facial growth. Three-dimensional (3D) assessment of dentofacial growth deviation has become more common with advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies. However, no standardized guidelines exist for interpretation of 3D imaging in patients with JIA. The aim of this study was to propose and validate morphometric measures for the 3D radiographic assessment of dentofacial growth deviation in patients with JIA to enhance: 1) Description of dentofacial growth deviation; 2) Treatment planning; 3) Longitudinal follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in a standardized sequential-phased approach involving: 1) Preliminary decision-making; 2) Item generation; 3) Test of content-validity; 4) Test of reliability; 5) Test of construct validity; 6) Establishment of final recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one morphometric measures were evaluated. Based on results of reliability and validity-testing including subjects with JIA (n = 70) and non-JIA controls (n = 19), seven measures received a “high recommendation” score. Those measures were associated with posterior mandibular height, occlusal cant, mandibular asymmetry, mandibular inclination, and anterior/posterior lower face height. Nine other measures were “moderately recommended” and five received a “somewhat recommendation” score.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Seven morphometric measures were considered very useful in the 3D assessment of growth deviation in patients with TMJ disease associated with JIA.

It is generally believed that the unencapsulated sensory nerve terminals of modality specific C- and Aδ-neurons lack structural specialization. Here we determined the morphology of functionally defined polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors in the guinea pig corneal epithelium. Polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors were identified by extracellular recording at the surface of the corneal epithelium. After marking the recording sites, corneas were processed to reveal immunoreactivity for the transient receptor potential channels TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1) or TPRM8 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8). Polymodal receptor nerve terminals (n = 6) were TRPV1-immunoreactive and derived from an axon that ascended from the sub-basal plexus to the squamous cell layer where it branched into fibers that ran parallel to the corneal surface and terminated with small bulbar endings (ramifying endings). Cold thermoreceptor nerve terminals were TRPM8-immunoreactive (n = 6) and originated from an axon that branched as it ascended through the wing cell and squamous cell layers and terminated with large bulbar endings (complex endings). These findings indicate that modality specific corneal sensory neurons with unencapsulated nerve endings have distinct nerve terminal morphologies that are likely to relate to their function.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Abdulhakeem S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Dietary diversity scores (DDS) are considered as metrics for monitoring the implementation of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, but they need to be rigorously evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine two DDS, the Food Groups Index (FGI), and the Minimum Dietary Diversity-Women (MDD-W), alongside two dietary quality scores, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010) and the Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS), with risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs).&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The analysis included 21,312 (GDM) and 19,917 (HDPs) singleton births reported in the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort (1991–2001), among women without major chronic disease or GDM/HDPs. Scores were derived using prepregnancy diet collected by a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable models were utilized to calculate relative risks (RR) and confidence intervals (95%CIs).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Incident GDM (n = 916) and HDPs (n = 1,421) were reported. The MDD-W and FGI were not associated with risk of GDM or HDPs, but the AHEI-2010 and PDQS were associated with a lower risk of GDM and marginally lower risk of HDP. The RR’s of GDM comparing the highest vs. lowest quintiles were 1.00 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.27; p-trend = 0.82) for MDD-W, 0.96 (95%CI: 0.76, 1.22; p-trend = 0.88) for FGI, 0.63 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.81; p-trend &amp;lt;0.0001) for the AHEI-2010 and 0.68 (95%CI: 0.54, 0.86; p-trend = 0.003) for the PDQS. Similarly, the RR’s of HDPs were 0.92 (95%CI: 0.75, 1.12, p-trend = 0.94) for MDD-W, 0.97 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.17; p-trend = 0.83) for FGI, 0.84 (95%CI: 0.70, 1.02; p-trend = 0.07) for AHEI-2010 and 0.89 (95%CI: 0.74, 1.09; p-trend = 0.07) for PDQS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MDD-W and FGI did not predict the risk of GDM and HDPs.

Background &lt;p&gt;Dietary diversity scores (DDS) are considered as metrics for monitoring the implementation of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, but they need to be rigorously evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine two DDS, the Food Groups Index (FGI), and the Minimum Dietary Diversity-Women (MDD-W), alongside two dietary quality scores, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010) and the Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS), with risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs).&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The analysis included 21,312 (GDM) and 19,917 (HDPs) singleton births reported in the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort (1991–2001), among women without major chronic disease or GDM/HDPs. Scores were derived using prepregnancy diet collected by a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable models were utilized to calculate relative risks (RR) and confidence intervals (95%CIs).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Incident GDM (n = 916) and HDPs (n = 1,421) were reported. The MDD-W and FGI were not associated with risk of GDM or HDPs, but the AHEI-2010 and PDQS were associated with a lower risk of GDM and marginally lower risk of HDP. The RR’s of GDM comparing the highest vs. lowest quintiles were 1.00 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.27; p-trend = 0.82) for MDD-W, 0.96 (95%CI: 0.76, 1.22; p-trend = 0.88) for FGI, 0.63 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.81; p-trend &amp;lt;0.0001) for the AHEI-2010 and 0.68 (95%CI: 0.54, 0.86; p-trend = 0.003) for the PDQS. Similarly, the RR’s of HDPs were 0.92 (95%CI: 0.75, 1.12, p-trend = 0.94) for MDD-W, 0.97 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.17; p-trend = 0.83) for FGI, 0.84 (95%CI: 0.70, 1.02; p-trend = 0.07) for AHEI-2010 and 0.89 (95%CI: 0.74, 1.09; p-trend = 0.07) for PDQS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MDD-W and FGI did not predict the risk of GDM and HDPs. These DDS should not be widely used as metrics for achieving dietary goals in their present form. The Prime Diet Quality Score warrants further testing as a promising measure of a sustainable and healthy diet on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522789200000</published><title>Evaluating pre-pregnancy dietary diversity vs. dietary quality scores as predictors of gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/163-a?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/163-a?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/163-a?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523554635000</published><author><name>Zaringhalam, M., Vijayaraghavan, R., Simonis, J., Ramirez, K., Zelikova, J., on behalf of 500 Women Scientists</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/163.1.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>93</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fece9e:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><fingerprint>35e481c9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagementRate>6.64</engagementRate><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Journal editors should not divide scientists</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286906v1?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286906v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286906v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Gene regulatory effects of microRNAs at a posttranscriptional level has been established over the last decade.

Background &lt;p&gt;Middle ear disease (otitis media) is endemic among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia and represents an important cause of hearing loss. The disease is the result of a mix of biological, environmental and host risk factors that interact in complex, non-linear ways along a dynamic continuum. As such, it is generally recognised that a holistic, systems approach is required to reverse the high rates of otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The objective of this paper is to examine the alignment between efforts designed to address otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Queensland, Australia and core concepts of systems thinking. This paper’s overall purpose is to identify which combination of activities, and at which level, hold the potential to facilitate systems changes to better support ear health among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We began with a review of documents identified in consultation with stakeholders and an online search. In addition, key informants were invited to participate in an online survey and a face-to-face or phone interview. Qualitative interviews using a semi-structured interview guide were used to explore survey responses in more depth. We also undertook interviews at the community level to elicit a diverse range of views. Ideas, statements or activities reported in the documents and interviews as being performed under the Intervention Level Framework were identified using qualitative thematic and content analysis. A quantitative descriptive analysis was also undertaken, whereby data was extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and coded under the relevant strategic directions and performance indicators of the Framework. Subsequently, we coded activities against the five-level intervention framework developed by Malhi and colleagues, that is: 1) paradigm; 2) goals; 3) system structure; 4) feedback and delays; and 5) structural elements.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, twenty documents were reviewed. We examined surveys and interviews with six key informants. Twenty-four individual and 3 group interviews were conducted across central and community level informants. One hundred and four items were coded from the 20 documents and 156 items from interview data. For both data sets, the majority of activities were coded at the structural elements level. The results suggested three key areas where further work is needed to drive sustained improvements: 1) build the governance structures needed for paradigm shift to achieve a multi-sectoral approach; 2) develop shared system level goals; 3) develop system-wide feedback processes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sustained progress in improving ear health within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children requires a holistic, system-wide approach. To advance such work, governance structures for multi-sectoral collaboration including the development of joint goals and monitoring and feedback are required. Intervening at these higher leverage points could have a profound effect on persistent public health issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Jo Durham</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194275</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087e1:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><fingerprint>ea9b2d45</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jo Durham, Lisa Schubert, Lisa Vaughan, Cameron D.

Background &lt;p&gt;Different outcomes among patients hospitalized for bleeding after starting anticoagulation could influence choice of anticoagulant. We compared length of hospitalization, proportion of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length of stay, and 30- and 90-day mortality for adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An US commercial database of 38 million members from 1 November 2010 to 31 March 2014 was used to examine adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin (2,446), dabigatran (442), or rivaroxaban (256). Outcomes included difference in mean total length of hospitalization, proportion of ICU admissions, mean length of ICU stay, and all-cause 30- and 90-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Warfarin users were older and had more comorbidities. Multivariable regression modeling with propensity score weighting showed warfarin users were hospitalized 2.0 days longer (95% CI 1.8–2.3; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than dabigatran users and 2.6 days longer (95% CI 2.4–2.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. Dabigatran users were hospitalized 0.6 days longer (95% CI 0.2–1.0; p = 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in the proportion of ICU admissions. Among ICU admissions, warfarin users stayed 3.0 days (95% CI 1.9–3.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) longer than dabigatran users and 2.4 days longer (95% CI 0.9–3.7; p = 0.003) than rivaroxaban users. There was no difference in ICU stay between dabigatran and rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rivaroxaban and dabigatran were associated with shorter hospitalizations; however, there were no differences in 30- and 90-day mortality.

Avian Colibacillosis is among the major causes of economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide, with a more vivid impact on developing countries. The involvement of several bacteria has made it challenging to develop effective vaccines for this disease, particularly because it is notoriously difficult to make a vaccine that contains all the contributing pathogenic bacteria. Here, we report the design and fabrication of a bacterial ghost (BG) of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O78:K80, which is among the major bacterial serotypes responsible for this disease. The generated ghost is then exploited as a homologous vaccine against Avian Colibacillosis. We demonstrate that hole formation in the cell wall of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O78:K80 can happen properly in optical densities as high as 0.8 compared to the 0.3–0.4 standard for bacteria like &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10. This is especially advantageous for mass production of this ghost which is a vital factor in development of any BG-based vaccine. Compared to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10, we faced a great challenge in transforming the wild type bacteria with the E-lysis plasmid which was probably due to higher thickness of the cell wall in O78:K80. This, however, was addressed by treating the cell wall with a different combination of ions.The vaccine was administered to Ross 308 broiler chickens via injection as well as through their respiratory system at a dose of 1010 BGs, repeated 3 times at weekly intervals. Chickens were then challenged with the wild type O78:K80 at a dose of 1011 bacteria together with Infectious Bronchitis H120 vaccine (as immunosuppressant) one week after the last immunization. Air sac lesions were significantly reduced in BG vaccinated groups in comparison with the control group. The levels of IFN&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;, IgA and IgY were measured in the serum of immunized chickens as an indication of immune response and were compared with those of the chickens vaccinated with killed bacteria. The results show that O78:K80 BG can be used as an efficient homologous vaccine against Colibacillosis disease in poultry. We expect our findings can serve as the starting point for designing more sophisticated vaccines that contain all three major pathogenic bacteria involved in avian Colibacillosis.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Hakimeh Ebrahimi-Nik</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194888</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34bf:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>a6baea31</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hakimeh Ebrahimi-Nik, Mohammad Reza Bassami, Mehrdad Mohri, Mehrnaz Rad, Mazhar I.

However, because linkage equilibrium implicates a broad region surrounding each identified locus, the causal genes often remain unknown. This problem is especially pronounced in non-human, non-model species where functional annotations are sparse and there is frequently little information available for prioritizing candidate genes. Results: To address this issue, we developed a computational approach called Camoco (Co-Analysis of Molecular Components) that systematically integrates loci identified by GWAS with gene co-expression networks to prioritize putative causal genes. We applied Camoco to prioritize candidate genes from a large-scale GWAS examining the accumulation of 17 different elements in maize seeds. Camoco identified statistically significant subnetworks for the majority of traits examined, producing a prioritized list of high-confidence causal genes for several agronomically important maize traits. Two candidate genes identified by our approach were validated through analysis of mutant phenotypes. Strikingly, we observed a strong dependence in the performance of our approach on the type of co-expression network used: expression variation across genetically diverse individuals in a relevant tissue context (in our case, maize roots) outperformed other alternatives. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that co-expression networks can provide a powerful basis for prioritizing candidate causal genes from GWAS loci, but suggests that the success of such strategies can highly depend on the gene expression data context. Both the Camoco software and the lessons on integrating GWAS data with co-expression networks generalize to species beyond maize.

Results: To address this issue, we developed a computational approach called Camoco (Co-Analysis of Molecular Components) that systematically integrates loci identified by GWAS with gene co-expression networks to prioritize putative causal genes. We applied Camoco to prioritize candidate genes from a large-scale GWAS examining the accumulation of 17 different elements in maize seeds. Camoco identified statistically significant subnetworks for the majority of traits examined, producing a prioritized list of high-confidence causal genes for several agronomically important maize traits. Two candidate genes identified by our approach were validated through analysis of mutant phenotypes. Strikingly, we observed a strong dependence in the performance of our approach on the type of co-expression network used: expression variation across genetically diverse individuals in a relevant tissue context (in our case, maize roots) outperformed other alternatives. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that co-expression networks can provide a powerful basis for prioritizing candidate causal genes from GWAS loci, but suggests that the success of such strategies can highly depend on the gene expression data context. Both the Camoco software and the lessons on integrating GWAS data with co-expression networks generalize to species beyond maize.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing architectures with many interconnections of simple neural-inspired computing elements, and have been applied to biomedical fields such as imaging analysis and diagnosis. We have developed a new ANN framework called Cox-nnet to predict patient prognosis from high throughput transcriptomics data. In 10 TCGA RNA-Seq data sets, Cox-nnet achieves the same or better predictive accuracy compared to other methods, including Cox-proportional hazards regression (with LASSO, ridge, and mimimax concave penalty), Random Forests Survival and CoxBoost. Cox-nnet also reveals richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels. The outputs from the hidden layer node provide an alternative approach for survival-sensitive dimension reduction. In summary, we have developed a new method for accurate and efficient prognosis prediction on high throughput data, with functional biological insights.

The abortifacient Mifepristone (RU486) has proven to be a safe, effective, acceptable option for millions of women seeking abortion during the first and second trimester of pregnancy although its precise mechanism of action is not well understood. The main objective of this study was to investigate the impact of low dose Mifepristone administration on placental Galectin-9 (Gal-9) expression, as well as its effect on the cell surface expression of Gal-9, TIM-3 and CD107a molecules by different T and NK cell subsets. A model of Mifepristone-induced immunological changes was established in syngeneic pregnant BALB/c mice. RU486-induced alteration in placental Gal-9 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. For immunophenotypic analysis, mid-pregnancy decidual lymphocytes and peripheral mononuclear cells were obtained from Mifepristone treated and control mice at the 14.5 day of gestation. TIM-3 and Gal-9 expression by peripheral and decidual immune cells were examined by flow cytometry. Our results revealed a dramatically decreased intracellular Gal-9 expression in the spongiotrophoblast layer of the haemochorial placenta in Mifepristone treated pregnant mice. Although low dose RU486 treatment did not cause considerable change in the phenotypic distribution of decidual and peripheral immune cells, it altered the Gal-9 and TIM-3 expression by different NK and T cell subsets. In addition, the treatment significantly decreased the CD107a expression by decidual TIM-3+ NK cells, but increased its expression by decidual NKT cell compared to the peripheral counterparts. These findings suggest that low dose Mifepristone administration might induce immune alterations in both progesterone dependent and independent way.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Adrienn Lajko</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194870</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34bc:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>93f543f6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adrienn Lajko, Matyas Meggyes, Beata Polgar, Laszlo Szereday&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Common colds are the most frequently encountered disease worldwide and the most frequent reason for self-care. According to the cross-sectional European Common Colds study (COCO), patients use as many as 12 items on average for self-care. Little is known about the influence of discomfort and knowledge on self-care for common colds.&lt;/p&gt; Main objective &lt;p&gt;To understand the influence of patients’ discomfort during a cold and their knowledge about the self-limited disease course on the use of self-care measures.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This COCO analysis included 2,204 patients from 22 European primary care sites in 12 countries. Each site surveyed 120 consecutive adults with a 27-item questionnaire asking about patients’ self-care, subjective discomfort during a cold (discomfort: yes/no), and knowledge about the self-limited course (yes/no). Country-specific medians of the number of self-care items served as a cut-off to define high and low self-care use. Four groups were stratified based on discomfort (yes/no) and knowledge (yes/no).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Participants’ mean age was 46.5 years, 61.7% were female; 36.3% lacked knowledge; 70.6% reported discomfort. The group &lt;i&gt;has discomfort/no knowledge&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the highest mean item use (13.3), followed by &lt;i&gt;has discomfort/has knowledge&lt;/i&gt; (11.9), &lt;i&gt;no discomfort/no knowledge&lt;/i&gt; (11.1), and &lt;i&gt;no discomfort/has knowledge&lt;/i&gt; (8.8). High use was associated with discomfort (OR 1.8; CI 1.5–2.2), female gender (OR 1.7; 1.4–2.0), chronic pain/arthritis (OR 1.6; 1.2–2.1), more years of education (OR 1.3; 1.1–1.6), age &amp;lt;48 years (OR 1.3; 1.0–1.5), and lack of knowledge (OR 1.2; 1.0–1.4).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Counseling on common colds should address patients’ discomfort and soothing measures in addition to providing information on the natural disease course.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Anika Thielmann</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793625:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>a75a52e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anika Thielmann, Biljana Gerasimovska-Kitanovska, Tuomas H.

Amnion is a membrane surrounding the embryo/fetus which determine growth factors and interleukins with angiogenic, immunogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of conditioned culture medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion (hAM CCM) on migration and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial primary cells (HUVECs), freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs), and Jurkat leukemia cell line. Amnion membrane was freshly isolated from healthy placenta and its fragments cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to produce hAM CCM. Members of the IGFBP protein family made up one third of all assayed proteins present in the hAM medium. The hAM CCM did not affect the proliferation rate of HUVECs or MNCs, but we observed more intensive migration of those cells, and lower expression of CD31 surface antigen on HUVECs as compared to control cultures. In contrast, Jurkat cells did not respond to hAM CCM treatment by proliferation or mobility change. The conditioned medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion is easy to obtain and is a convenient source of various growth and other factors that may be useful in practical medicine.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Zofia Grzywocz</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195035</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1c:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>93b0fe42</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zofia Grzywocz, Grazyna Hoser, Stanislawa Sabalinska, Piotr Ladyzynski, Jaroslaw Czubak, Malgorzata Dworczynska, Romuald Debski, Ewa Pius-Sadowska, Boguslaw Machalinski, Jerzy Kawiak&lt;/p&gt;

Although significant attention has been devoted to analyzing stigma associated with epilepsy, there is still a significant lack of valid and reliable instruments. We aimed to validate the 23-item Czech version of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE; originally developed in Brazil), which has been used to evaluate epilepsy-related stigma in the general population. Verification of the SSE questionnaire was carried out in a group of 207 students aged 15–18 years of whom none had epilepsy. These students completed the SSE twice in a period of 3–6 months as part of standard test-retest evaluation practice. The instrument exhibits good psychometric properties including internal consistency higher than in the original version (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.856 here compared with 0.81 reported in Brazil) and acceptable test-retest reliability. Using exploratory factor analysis (not provided for the original version), four factors were identified and corresponding subscales were described and interpreted. Two items did not fit into the structure and were eliminated. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to propose and verify the hierarchical 4-factor structure of the Czech version of SSE confirming the existence of a common factor corresponding to stigma. The results showed that the Czech version of SSE has good psychometric properties and can be used in further research and clinical practice.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Dana Brabcová</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195225</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde2b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>a2b21182</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dana Brabcová, Jiří Kohout, Daniel Potužák, Barbora Beňová, Pavel Kršek&lt;/p&gt;

In this study, individuals estimated interval times of several minutes (from 2 to 32 minutes) during their everyday lives using a cell phone they kept with them. Their emotional state, the difficulty of the activity performed during this interval, and the attention that it required were also assessed, together with their subjective experience of the passage of time. The results showed that the mean time estimates and their variability increased linearly with increasing interval duration, indicating that the fundamental scalar property of time found for short durations also applies to very long durations of several minutes. In addition, the emotional state and difficulty of the activity were significant predictors of the judgment of long durations. However, the awareness of the passage of time appeared to play a crucial role in the judgment of very long duration in humans. A theory on the emergence of the awareness of the passage of time and how it affects the judgment of interval durations lasting several minutes is therefore discussed.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Sylvie Droit-Volet</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195397</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6e:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>a61dd276</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sylvie Droit-Volet, Sophie Monceau, Mickaël Berthon, Panos Trahanias, Michail Maniadakis&lt;/p&gt;

Metrics to quantify child growth vary across studies of the developmental origins of health and disease.

It is an absolute requirement that every time you write about graphene that you mention that the breakthrough in its isolation came from the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0218/230218-graphene-sticky-tape&quot;&gt;adhesive tape&lt;/a&gt;, a low-tech insight at Manchester that led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/&quot;&gt;Nobel&lt;/a&gt; and kicked off a massive field of research. The latest is that earlier this month, a group at MIT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02773-w&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that if you bring two graphene sheets together, parallel but at a slightly different rotational angle (about 1.1 degrees), that the system becomes a superconductor at low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was already unexpected, but the behavior of the material (electron density versus temperature) suggests some real similarities to the copper-oxide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity&quot;&gt;high-temperature superconductors&lt;/a&gt;, and no one saw that coming, either. (Note that “high temperature”, in this field, still means “can be reached in liquid nitrogen as opposed to liquid helium”). Despite a really impressive amount of theoretical and experimental work on the cuprate materials, the full details of their superconductivity are still a matter of debate. It seems to come down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair&quot;&gt;Cooper pairs&lt;/a&gt; (as with the classic low-temperature superconductors, but the mechanism of the electron pairing is different and in ways that still start arguments. This new graphene systems might be able to shed some light on the various proposals, and you can be certain that a great deal of late-night coffee has been consumed in recent weeks to come up with appropriate experiments along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical value of such an understanding could well be huge (and there is, of course, another near-certain Nobel in physics waiting for whoever puts the field on a firmer basis). To give another recent MIT-related example, new superconductor engineering is at the heart of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-newly-formed-company-launch-novel-approach-fusion-power-0309&quot;&gt;recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; the university made about fusion power. The belief is that large-bore magnets of such materials, which now appear feasible, could allow a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak&quot;&gt;tokamak&lt;/a&gt;-design fusion reactor that is far more compact than any previous attempts. Wrestling with the magnets is one of the biggest problems in designing such machines, because you need extremely strong, extremely homogeneous fields. The high-temperature superconductors were recognized early on as having great possibilities in this area, but the first fusion reactor that used only these materials only became operational in 2014 (a spherical tokamak design at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Tokamak Energy&lt;/a&gt; in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphene-layer materials are still operating at very low temperatures – but considering their electron density, it’s actually a lot higher than it should be. No one is going to be make fusion reactors with twisted-graphite magnets any time soon, but twisted graphite might possibly be the platform that leads us to the magnets that fusion reactors will use.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>I wanted to mention something on the border between chemistry and physics that might well turn out to be important.

Decades of research have demonstrated the crucial importance of viruses in freshwater ecosystems. However, few studies have focused on the seasonal dynamics and potential hosts of RNA viruses. We surveyed microbial-sized (i.e. 5–0.2 μm) mixed community plankton transcriptomes for RNA viral genomes and investigated their distribution between microbial and macrobial plankton over a seasonal cycle across three temperate lakes by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). A total of 30 contigs bearing similarity to RNA viral genomes were recovered from a global assembly of 30 plankton RNA libraries. Of these, only 13 were found in &gt;2 libraries and recruited &gt;100 reads (of 9.13 x 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; total reads), representing several picornaviruses, two tobamoviruses and a reovirus. We quantified the abundance of four picornaviruses and the reovirus monthly from August 2014 to May 2015. Patterns of viral abundance in the &gt;5 μm size fraction and representation in microbial-sized community RNA libraries over time suggest that one picornavirus genotype (TS24835) and the reovirus (TS148892) may infect small (&amp;lt;5 μm) eukaryotic microorganisms, while two other picornaviruses (TS24641 and TS4340) may infect larger (&gt;5 μm) eukaryotic microorganisms or metazoa. Our data also suggest that picornavirus TS152062 may originate from an allochthonous host. All five viral genotypes were present in at least one size fraction across all 3 lakes during the year, suggesting that RNA viruses may easily disperse between adjacent aquatic habitats. Our data therefore demonstrate that RNA viruses are widespread in temperate lacustrine ecosystems, and may provide evidence of viral infection in larger eukaryotes (including metazoa) inhabiting the lakes.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Ian Hewson</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194419</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a61a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>3caa9793</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ian Hewson, Kalia S.

Virus-mediated expression of defined transcription factor (TF) genes can effectively induce cellular reprogramming. However, sustained expression of the TFs often hinders pluripotent stem cell (PSC) differentiation into specific cell types, as each TF exerts its effect on PSCs for a defined period of time during differentiation. Here, we applied a bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS)-based protein delivery tool to directly translocate TFs in the form of protein into human PSCs. This transient protein delivery technique showed high delivery efficiency for hPSCs, and it avoids potential genetic alterations caused by the introduction of transgenes. In an established cardiomyocyte &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; differentiation procedure, five transcriptional factors, namely GATA4, MEF2C, TBX5, ESRRG and MESP1 (abbreviated as GMTEM), were translocated at various time points. By detecting the expression of cardiac marker genes (&lt;i&gt;Nkx2&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cTnT&lt;/i&gt;), we found that GMTEM proteins delivered on mesoderm stage of the cardiomyocytes lineage differentiation significantly enhanced both the human ESC and iPSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes, while earlier or later delivery diminished the enhancing effect. Furthermore, all of the five factors were required to enhance the cardiac differentiation.

The fornicata (fornicates) is a eukaryotic group known to consist of free-living and parasitic organisms. Genome datasets of two model fornicate parasites &lt;i&gt;Giardia intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Spironucleus salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are well annotated, so far.

However, an ancestral genomic structure and gene contents, from which genomes of the fornicate parasites have evolved, remains to be clarified. In order to understand genome evolution in fornicates, here, we present the draft genome sequence of a free-living fornicate, &lt;i&gt;Kipferlia bialata&lt;/i&gt;, the divergence of which is earlier than those of the fornicate parasites, and compare it to the genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt;.

However, available circadian gene expression atlases of a few organs are largely from nocturnal vertebrates. We report the diurnal transcriptome of 64 tissues, including 22 brain regions, sampled every 2 hours over 24 hours, from the primate &lt;i&gt;Papio anubis&lt;/i&gt; (baboon). Genomic transcription was highly rhythmic, with up to 81.7% of protein-coding genes showing daily rhythms in expression. In addition to tissue-specific gene expression, the rhythmic transcriptome imparts another layer of functional specialization. Most ubiquitously expressed genes that participate in essential cellular functions exhibit rhythmic expression in a tissue-specific manner. The peak phases of rhythmic gene expression clustered around dawn and dusk, with a &amp;quot;quiescent period&amp;quot; during early night.

However, available circadian gene expression atlases of a few organs are largely from nocturnal vertebrates. We report the diurnal transcriptome of 64 tissues, including 22 brain regions, sampled every 2 hours over 24 hours, from the primate &lt;i&gt;Papio anubis&lt;/i&gt; (baboon). Genomic transcription was highly rhythmic, with up to 81.7% of protein-coding genes showing daily rhythms in expression. In addition to tissue-specific gene expression, the rhythmic transcriptome imparts another layer of functional specialization. Most ubiquitously expressed genes that participate in essential cellular functions exhibit rhythmic expression in a tissue-specific manner. The peak phases of rhythmic gene expression clustered around dawn and dusk, with a &amp;quot;quiescent period&amp;quot; during early night.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterised by pancreatic beta cell destruction and absolute insulin deficiency. The strongest predictor of diabetes complications is glycaemic control and achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0% is the primary management target. However, standard treatment appears to be lacking and adjunctive strategies require consideration. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effect of low-carbohydrate diets on type 1 diabetes management. Four databases were searched from inception until 28 March 2017: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; and EMBASE. All primary studies containing a methods section (excluding cross-sectional) were included. Reports had to quantitatively measure the effect(s) of a dietary intervention or observed intake over at least two weeks where carbohydrate is below 45% total energy in adults and/or children with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was HbA1c and secondary outcomes were severe hypoglycaemia, total daily insulin, BMI, quality of life and mean daily glucose. Seventy-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and nine were included (two randomised controlled trials, four pre-post interventions, two case-series, one case-report). Eight studies reported a mean change in HbA1c with a low-carbohydrate diet. Of these, four reported a non-significant change (P ≥ 0.05) and three reported statistically significant reductions (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia, five reported total insulin, three reported BMI, and one reported blood glucose. Due to the significant heterogeneity of included studies, an overall effect could not be determined. This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Jessica L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Carriers of mutations in hereditary cancer predisposition genes represent a small but clinically important subgroup of oncology patients. The identification of causal germline mutations determines follow-up management, treatment options and genetic counselling in patients’ families. Targeted next-generation sequencing-based analyses using cancer-specific panels in high-risk individuals have been rapidly adopted by diagnostic laboratories. While the use of diagnosis-specific panels is straightforward in typical cases, individuals with unusual phenotypes from families with overlapping criteria require multiple panel testing. Moreover, narrow gene panels are limited by our currently incomplete knowledge about possible genetic dispositions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We have designed a multi-gene panel called CZECANCA (CZEch CAncer paNel for Clinical Application) for a sequencing analysis of 219 cancer-susceptibility and candidate predisposition genes associated with frequent hereditary cancers.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The bioanalytical and bioinformatics pipeline was validated on a set of internal and commercially available DNA controls showing high coverage uniformity, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

is involved in a number of biological processes in our bodies. Metabolism of
L-arginine by the enzyme arginase has been found to be associated with cancer
cell proliferation. Arginase inhibition has been proposed as a potential therapeutic
means to inhibit this process. N-hydroxy-nor-L-Arg (nor-NOHA) and N (omega)-hydroxy-L-arginine
(NOHA) has shown promise in inhibiting cancer progression through arginase
inhibition. In this study, nor-NOHA and NOHA-associated genes and proteins were
analyzed with several Bioinformatics and Systems Biology tools to identify the associated
pathways and the key players involved so that a more comprehensive view of the
molecular mechanisms including the regulatory mechanisms can be achieved and more
potential targets for treatment of cancer can be discovered. Based on the
analyses carried out, 3 significant
modules have been identified from the PPI network. Five pathways/processes have
been found to be significantly associated with nor-NOHA and NOHA associated
genes. Out of the 1996 proteins in the PPI network, 4 have
been identified as hub proteins- SOD, SOD1, AMD1, and NOS2. These 4 proteins have been implicated
in cancer by other studies. Thus, this study provided further validation into
the claim of these 4 proteins being potential targets for cancer treatment.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>L-arginine

Background &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, the incidence and mortality rates of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been steadily increasing in young women but not in men. Environmental variables that contribute to cardiovascular events in women remain ill-defined.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;A total of 2199 consecutive patients presenting with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 25.8% women, mean age 62.6±12.4 years) were admitted at the Montreal Heart Institute between June 2010 and December 2014. Snow fall exceeding 2cm/day was identified as a positive predictor for STEMI admission rates in the overall population (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07–1.48, p = 0.005), with a significant effect being seen in men (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06–1.53, p = 0.01) but not in women (p = NS). An age-specific analysis revealed a significant increase in hospital admission rates for STEMI in younger women ≤55 years, (n = 104) during days with higher outside temperature (p = 0.004 vs men ≤55 years) and longer daylight hours (p = 0.0009 vs men ≤55 years). Accordingly, summer season, increased outside temperature and sunshine hours were identified as strong positive predictors for STEMI occurrence in women ≤55 years (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.1–2.5, p = 0.012, RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.007, and RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.011, respectively), while an opposite trend was observed in men ≤55 years (RR for outside temperature 0.8, 95% CI 0.73–0.95, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The impact of environmental variables on STEMI is age- and sex-dependent. Higher temperature may play an important role in triggering such acute events in young women.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Catherine Gebhard</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195602</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529b:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>d22e6c56</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Catherine Gebhard, Caroline E.

Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused great public concerns due to its recent large outbreaks and a close association with microcephaly in fetus and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Rapid development of vaccines against ZIKV is a public health priority. To this end, we have constructed and purified recombinant ZIKV envelope protein using both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, and then tested their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in immune competent mice. Both protein immunogens elicited humoral and cellular immune responses, and protected immune competent mice from ZIKV challenge &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These products could be further evaluated either as stand-alone vaccine candidate, or used in a prime-and-boost regimen with other forms of ZIKV vaccine.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Huabin Liang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194860</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4243:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>5750fff5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huabin Liang, Ruoheng Yang, Zhihua Liu, Min Li, Haitao Liu, Xia Jin&lt;/p&gt;

These products could be further evaluated either as stand-alone vaccine candidate, or used in a prime-and-boost regimen with other forms of ZIKV vaccine.</description><published>1522270800000</published><title>Recombinant Zika virus envelope protein elicited protective immunity against Zika virus in immunocompetent mice</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03303-4</originId><published>1521529200000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03303-4</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03303-4</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrections&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrections, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03303-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03303-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Corrections</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1624380c043:2e2fc80:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521550934083</crawled><fingerprint>358716bb</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrections&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrections, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03303-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03303-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Corrections</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Corrections</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11091</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>297</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b11091/20180406/images/medium/jp-2017-110917_0020.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11091</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/2VbB4xB-AhE/acs.jpcb.7b11091</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522987200000</published><author><name>Leena Aggarwal, Parbati Biswas</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11091</link><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_1629bd2db85:443ab0:51a16d64</id><crawled>1523032710021</crawled><fingerprint>d221e444</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b11091/20180406/images/medium/jp-2017-110917_0020.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11091&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

When unifying genomic resources among studies and comparing data between species, there is often no better resource than a genome sequence. Having a reference genome for the Chinook salmon (&lt;i&gt;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&lt;/i&gt;) will enable the extensive genomic resources available for Pacific salmon, Atlantic salmon, and rainbow trout to be leveraged when asking questions related to the Chinook salmon. The Chinook salmon’s wide distribution, long cultural impact, evolutionary history, substantial hatchery production, and recent wild-population decline make it an important research species. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the genome of a Chilliwack River Hatchery female Chinook salmon (gynogenetic and homozygous at all loci). With a reference genome sequence, new questions can be asked about the nature of this species, and its role in a rapidly changing world.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Kris A.

Deciphering a function of a given protein requires investigating various biological aspects. Usually, the protein of interest is expressed with a fusion tag that aids or allows subsequent analyses. Additionally, downregulation or inactivation of the studied gene enables functional studies. Development of the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology opened many possibilities but in many cases it is restricted to non-essential genes. Recombinase-dependent gene integration methods, like the Flp-In system, are very good alternatives. The system is widely used in different research areas, which calls for the existence of compatible vectors and efficient protocols that ensure straightforward DNA cloning and generation of stable cell lines. We have created and validated a robust series of 52 vectors for streamlined generation of stable mammalian cell lines using the FLP recombinase-based methodology. Using the sequence-independent DNA cloning method all constructs for a given coding-sequence can be made with just three universal PCR primers. Our collection allows tetracycline-inducible expression of proteins with various tags suitable for protein localization, FRET, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), protein dynamics studies (FRAP), co-immunoprecipitation, the RNA tethering assay and cell sorting. Some of the vectors contain a bidirectional promoter for concomitant expression of miRNA and mRNA, so that a gene can be silenced and its product replaced by a mutated miRNA-insensitive version. Our toolkit and protocols have allowed us to create more than 500 constructs with ease. We demonstrate the efficacy of our vectors by creating stable cell lines with various tagged proteins (numatrin, fibrillarin, coilin, centrin, THOC5, PCNA).

Deciphering a function of a given protein requires investigating various biological aspects. Usually, the protein of interest is expressed with a fusion tag that aids or allows subsequent analyses. Additionally, downregulation or inactivation of the studied gene enables functional studies. Development of the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology opened many possibilities but in many cases it is restricted to non-essential genes. Recombinase-dependent gene integration methods, like the Flp-In system, are very good alternatives. The system is widely used in different research areas, which calls for the existence of compatible vectors and efficient protocols that ensure straightforward DNA cloning and generation of stable cell lines. We have created and validated a robust series of 52 vectors for streamlined generation of stable mammalian cell lines using the FLP recombinase-based methodology. Using the sequence-independent DNA cloning method all constructs for a given coding-sequence can be made with just three universal PCR primers. Our collection allows tetracycline-inducible expression of proteins with various tags suitable for protein localization, FRET, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), protein dynamics studies (FRAP), co-immunoprecipitation, the RNA tethering assay and cell sorting. Some of the vectors contain a bidirectional promoter for concomitant expression of miRNA and mRNA, so that a gene can be silenced and its product replaced by a mutated miRNA-insensitive version. Our toolkit and protocols have allowed us to create more than 500 constructs with ease. We demonstrate the efficacy of our vectors by creating stable cell lines with various tagged proteins (numatrin, fibrillarin, coilin, centrin, THOC5, PCNA). We have analysed transgene expression over time to provide a guideline for future experiments and compared the effectiveness of commonly used inducers for tetracycline-responsive promoters. As proof of concept we examined the role of the exoribonuclease XRN2 in transcription termination by RNAseq.</description><published>1522270800000</published><title>Versatile approach for functional analysis of human proteins and efficient stable cell line generation using FLP-mediated recombination system</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194259</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194259</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194259</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elske T.

Background &lt;p&gt;Levothyroxine replacement treatment in hypothyroidism is unable to restore physiological thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations in serum and tissues completely. Normal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations reflect only pituitary euthyroidism and, therefore, novel biomarkers representing tissue-specific thyroid state are needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding regulatory RNAs, exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns and can be detectable in serum. Previous studies have demonstrated differential expression of (precursors of) miRNAs in tissues under the influence of thyroid hormone.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To study if serum miRNA profiles are changed in different thyroid states.&lt;/p&gt; Design and methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 13 athyroid patients (6 males) during TSH suppressive therapy and after 4 weeks of thyroid hormone withdrawal. A magnetic bead capture system was used to isolate 384 defined miRNAs from serum. Subsequently, the TaqMan Array Card 3.0 platform was used for profiling after individual target amplification.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age of the subjects was 44.0 years (range 20–61 years). Median TSH levels were 88.9 mU/l during levothyroxine withdrawal and 0.006 mU/l during LT4 treatment with a median dosage of 2.1 μg/kg. After normalization to allow inter-sample analysis, a paired analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in expression of any of the 384 miRNAs analyzed on and off LT4 treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Although we previously showed an up-regulation of pri-miRNAs 133b and 206 in hypothyroid state in skeletal muscle, the present study does not supply evidence that thyroid state also affects serum miRNAs in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Elske T.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We examine to what extent the effect of early-life conditions (health and socioeconomic status) on health in later life is mediated by educational attainment and life-course trajectories (fertility, partnership, employment).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 12,034), we apply, separately by gender, multichannel sequence analysis and cluster analysis to obtain groups of similar family and employment histories. The KHB method is used to disentangle direct and indirect effects of early-life conditions on health.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Early-life-conditions indirectly impact on health in later life as result of their influence on education and family and employment trajectories. For example, between 22% and 42% of the effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Even higher percentages are found for men (35% - 57%). On the contrary, the positive effect of poor health at childhood on poor health at older ages is not significantly mediated by education and life-course trajectories. Education captures most of the mediating effect of parental socio-economic status. More specifically, between 66% and 75% of the indirect effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Again, higher percentages are found for men (86% - 93%). Early-life conditions, especially socioeconomic status, influence family and employment trajectories indirectly through their impact on education. We also find a persistent direct impact of early-life conditions on health at older ages.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate that early-life experiences influence education and life-course trajectories and health in later life, suggesting that public investments in children are expected to produce long lasting effects on people’s lives throughout the different phases of their life-course.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Bruno Arpino</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195320</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460c:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>90170977</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Arpino, Jordi Gumà, Albert Julià&lt;/p&gt;

We test the hypothesis that prehistoric Native American land use influenced the Euro-American settlement process in a South Carolina Piedmont landscape. Long term ecological studies demonstrate that land use legacies influence processes and trajectories in complex, coupled social and ecological systems. Native American land use likely altered the ecological and evolutionary feedback and trajectories of many North American landscapes. Yet, considerable debate revolves around the scale and extent of land use legacies of prehistoric Native Americans. At the core of this debate is the question of whether or not European colonists settled a mostly “wild” landscape or an already “humanized” landscape. We use statistical event analysis to model the effects of prehistoric Native American settlement on the rate of Colonial land grants (1749–1775). Our results reveal how abandoned Native American settlements were among the first areas claimed and homesteaded by Euro-Americans. We suggest that prehistoric land use legacies served as key focal nodes in the Colonial era settlement process. As a consequence, localized prehistoric land use legacies likely helped structure the long term, landscape- to regional-level ecological inheritances that resulted from Euro-American settlement.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Michael R.

This approach prevents the loss of important immunostimulatory ligands by human cancers and reactivates antitumor immunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522345097000</published><title>Antibody-mediated inhibition of MICA and MICB shedding promotes NK cell-driven tumor immunity</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23447-7</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23447-7</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/YnIfTGekpso/s41598-018-23447-7</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Interferometric rotating point spread function&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Interferometric rotating point spread function, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23447-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23447-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Interferometric rotating point spread function&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/YnIfTGekpso&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Wei Wang</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23447-7</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1624cc6c7fd:3d6fea8:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521706518525</crawled><fingerprint>ed5d1311</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Interferometric rotating point spread function&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Interferometric rotating point spread function, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23447-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23447-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Interferometric rotating point spread function&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/YnIfTGekpso&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1521702000000</published><title>Author Correction: Interferometric rotating point spread function</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194376</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194376</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194376</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Plesser, Mohammad Keilani, Gyoergy Vekszler, Timothy Hasenoehrl, Stefano Palma, Martin Reschl, Richard Crevenna, Stefan Hajdu, Harald Kurt Widhalm&lt;/p&gt;
Biomechanical studies have shown the use of suture anchors (SA) to be superior to the traditional transosseous sutures (TS) in the repair of quadriceps tendon rupture (QTR). This study aimed to analyze and compare the functional outcomes of patients treated for quadriceps tendon ruptures using suture anchors or transosseous sutures. Patients having undergone suture anchor repair or transosseous suture repair for quadriceps tendon rupture between 2010 and 2015 at one of the two participating hospitals were included. Patients from site A underwent TS repair (TS group) while patients from site B underwent SA repair (SA group). Exclusion criteria included previous or concomitant injuries of the involved knee, penetrating injuries and pre-existing neurological conditions. Clinical outcome was assessed by subjective scores (Lysholm and Tegner Scores, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Score, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain), quadriceps isokinetic strength testing, Insall-Salvati Index (ISI), and physical examination. Non-parametrical statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; test. Twenty-seven patients were included in the study of which 17 patients (63%) were available for follow-up (SA group: 9, TS group: 8). All patients were male with a mean age of 62.7 (SD: 8.8) and 57.9 (SD: 12.7) years for the SA group and TS group, respectively. The groups did not differ in terms of demographic characteristics. No clinically significant differences were identified between the two groups. There were no re-ruptures in either group. Treatment of quadriceps tendon rupture using suture anchors provides a clinically valid alternative treatment to the gold-standard transosseous suture repair.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Stefan Plesser</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194376</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f7:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>b2619fa</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Plesser, Mohammad Keilani, Gyoergy Vekszler, Timothy Hasenoehrl, Stefano Palma, Martin Reschl, Richard Crevenna, Stefan Hajdu, Harald Kurt Widhalm&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether lyophilized human platelet lysate (HPL) powder can preserve the growth factor concentrations and epitheliotrophic properties of liquid HPL, and potentially be used as a clinically-friendly treatment option.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two commercialized liquid HPLs, UltraGRO TM (Helios, Atlanta, GA) and PLTMax (Mill Creek, Rochester, MI), were obtained and converted to lyophilized powder. After redissolution, lyophilized powder HPLs were compared with liquid HPLs, as well as human peripheral serum (HPS) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) in liquid or redissolved lyophilized powder forms. Concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Human corneal epithelial cell line was incubated with the blood derivatives and evaluated for cell migration with scratch-induced directional wounding and proliferation with MTS assays. Cell differentiation was examined by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER).

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether lyophilized human platelet lysate (HPL) powder can preserve the growth factor concentrations and epitheliotrophic properties of liquid HPL, and potentially be used as a clinically-friendly treatment option.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two commercialized liquid HPLs, UltraGRO TM (Helios, Atlanta, GA) and PLTMax (Mill Creek, Rochester, MI), were obtained and converted to lyophilized powder. After redissolution, lyophilized powder HPLs were compared with liquid HPLs, as well as human peripheral serum (HPS) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) in liquid or redissolved lyophilized powder forms. Concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Human corneal epithelial cell line was incubated with the blood derivatives and evaluated for cell migration with scratch-induced directional wounding and proliferation with MTS assays. Cell differentiation was examined by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Fluorescein staining and in vivo confocal microscopy were used to evaluate in vivo corneal epithelial wound healing in Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent corneal debridement and topical application of liquid and redissolved powder HPLs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Liquid form and redissolved lyophilized powder form HPLs had similar concentrations of EGF, TGF-β1, PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments on cell migration, proliferation and differentiation and rat models on wound healing demonstrated no significant difference between the liquid and redissolved lyophilized powder forms for HPLs, HPS and FBS. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; confocal microscopy revealed similar wound healing process at different layers of cornea after corneal epithelial debridement between liquid form and redissolved lyophilized power form of HPLs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The redissolved lyophilized powder form of both commercialized HPLs showed similar growth factor concentrations and corneal epitheliotrophic abilities compared to the liquid form. Results suggest that the properties of liquid HPLs can be retained despite lyophilization and that lyophilized HPLs can be a treatment option for corneal epithelial disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521234000000</published><title>The corneal epitheliotrophic abilities of lyophilized powder form human platelet lysates</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194851</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194851</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194851</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Editors &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>The PLOS ONE Editors</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194851</canonicalUrl><engagement>11</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37c3:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>ff45afe5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Editors &lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521579600000</published><title>Retraction: Microbiome restoration diet improves digestion, cognition and physical and emotional wellbeing</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/OKpeOlc517M/s41598-018-23621-x</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Mosquitoes transmit a number of diseases in animals and humans, including Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses that affect millions of people each year. Controlling the disease-transmitting mosquitoes has proven to be a successful strategy to reduce the viruses transmission. Polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus, and a depletion of spermidine and spermine in the host via induction of spermine N-acetyltransferase restricts their replication. Spermine N-acetyltransferase is a key catabolic enzyme in the polyamine pathway, however there is no information of the enzyme identification in any insects. Aliphatic polyamines play a fundamental role in tissue growth and development in organisms. They are acetylated by spermidine/spermine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-acetyltransferase (SAT). In this study we provided a molecular and biochemical identification of SAT from &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. Screening of purified recombinant proteins against polyamines established that aaNAT5b, named previously based on sequence similarity with identified aaNAT1 in insects, is active to spermine and spermidine. A crystal structure was determined and used in molecular docking in this study. Key residues were identified to be involved in spermine binding using molecular docking and simulation. In addition, SAT transcript was down regulated by blood feeding using a real time PCR test. Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Huai Guan</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fe:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>ff4d936c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huai Guan, Maoying Wang, Chenghong Liao, Jing Liang, Prajwalini Mehere, Meiling Tian, Hairong Liu, Howard Robinson, Jianyong Li, Qian Han&lt;/p&gt;

Patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) can have extrahepatic manifestations. However, data about cardiac involvement of PBC is limited. We aimed in this study to analyze the clinical characteristics in patients with PBC complicated with and without cardiac involvement, and the risk factors of cardiac involvement in PBC. PBC patients admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2002 and February 2016 were consecutively enrolled. Structured interview, systemic rheumatologic examination, and laboratory tests were conducted for each patient, and risk factors of cardiac involvement were analyzed by comparing patients with and without cardiac involvement. In total, 580 PBC patients were enrolled, and cardiac involvement was identified in 24 patients (4%), with 11 male (46%) and a mean age of 57±8 year. Cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias were presented in 17 (70.8%) and 21 (87.5%) patients, respectively. Patients with cardiac involvement were more frequently male (46% vs. 11%, P&amp;lt;0.01), complicated with inflammatory myopathy (IM) (58% vs. 1%, P&amp;lt;0.01), and had a longer disease course (median, 72 vs 24 month, P&amp;lt;0.01). Furthermore, concomitant IM was the independent risk factor of cardiac involvement in PBC (OR = 77.333, 95% CI: 23.704–252.294). Cardiac involvement was a rare complication of PBC, which was more frequently observed in male or long-course patients. Importantly, concomitant IM was the strong independent risk factor of cardiac involvement in PBC. Given cardiac involvement is a serious complication, thorough evaluation of cardiac manifestation in high-risk PBC patients is highly recommended.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Sainan Bian</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194397</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e1d:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>754a3bfe</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sainan Bian, Hua Chen, Li Wang, Yunyun Fei, Yunjiao Yang, Linyi Peng, Yongzhe Li, Fengchun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Given cardiac involvement is a serious complication, thorough evaluation of cardiac manifestation in high-risk PBC patients is highly recommended.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Cardiac involvement in patients with primary biliary cholangitis: A 14-year longitudinal survey-based study</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34960</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34960</link><crawled>1521724000504</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521676800000</published><author><name>oliver.weichenrieder@tuebingen.mpg.de (Elena Khazina)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34960</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1624dd188f8:3e3a9da:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34960</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>e8e697fc</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Genes and Chromosomes</item><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><description>LINE-1 (L1) is an autonomous retrotransposon, which acted throughout mammalian evolution and keeps contributing to human genotypic diversity, genetic disease and cancer.

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Aspartame (L-aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester) is a non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) approved for use in more than 6000 dietary products and pharmaceuticals consumed by the general public including adults and children, pregnant and nursing mothers. However a recent prospective study reported a doubling of the risk of being overweight amongst 1-year old children whose mothers consumed NNS-sweetened beverages daily during pregnancy. We have previously shown that chronic aspartame (ASP) exposure commencing &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; may detrimentally affect adulthood adiposity status, glucose metabolism and aspects of behavior and spatial cognition, and that this can be modulated by developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade with the competitive antagonist CGP 39551 (CGP). Since glucose homeostasis and certain aspects of behavior and locomotion are regulated in part by the NMDAR-rich hypothalamus, which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal- (HPA) axis, we have elected to examine changes in hypothalamic and adrenal gene expression in response to ASP exposure in the presence or absence of developmental NMDAR antagonism with CGP, using Affymetrix microarray analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using 2-factor ANOVA we identified 189 ASP-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the adult male hypothalamus and 2188 in the adrenals, and a further 23 hypothalamic and 232 adrenal genes significantly regulated by developmental treatment with CGP alone. ASP exposure robustly elevated the expression of a network of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis, together with cell stress and inflammatory genes, consistent with previous reports of aspartame-induced CNS stress and oxidative damage. These genes were not differentially expressed in ASP mice with CGP antagonism. In the adrenal glands of ASP-exposed mice, GABA and Glutamate receptor subunit genes were amongst those most highly upregulated. Developmental NMDAR antagonism alone had less effect on adulthood gene expression and affected mainly hypothalamic neurogenesis and adrenal steroid metabolism. Combined ASP + CGP treatment mainly upregulated genes involved in adrenal drug and cholesterol metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ASP exposure increased the expression of functional networks of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis and adrenal catecholamine synthesis, patterns of expression which were not present in ASP-exposed mice with developmental NMDAR antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Kate S.

Dromedaries are capable of digesting plant cell wall with high content of lignocellulose of poor digestibility. Consequently, their intestinal microbiota can be a source of novel carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). To the best of our knowledge, no data are available describing the biochemical analysis of enzymes in dromedary intestinal microbiota. To investigate new hydrolytic enzymes from the dromedary gut, a fosmid library was constructed using metagenomic DNA from feces of non-domestic adult dromedary camels living in the Tunisian desert. High-throughput functional screening of 13756 clones resulted in 47 hit clones active on a panel of various chromogenic and non-chromogenic glycan substrates. Two of them, harboring multiple activities, were retained for further analysis. Clone 26H3 displayed activity on AZO-CM-cellulose, AZCL Carob galactomannan and Tween 20, while clone 36A23 was active on AZCL carob galactomannan and AZCL barley β-glucan.

HLA proteins have an essential role in the presentation of self and non-self peptides, as part of the adaptive immune response. Amongst the associated drugs-allele combinations, anti-HIV drug Abacavir has been shown to be associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele, and anti-epilepsy drug Carbamazepine with B*15:02, in both cases likely following the altered peptide repertoire model of interaction. Under this model, the drug binds directly to the antigen presentation region, causing different self peptides to be presented, which trigger an unwanted immune response.

HLA proteins have an essential role in the presentation of self and non-self peptides, as part of the adaptive immune response. Amongst the associated drugs-allele combinations, anti-HIV drug Abacavir has been shown to be associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele, and anti-epilepsy drug Carbamazepine with B*15:02, in both cases likely following the altered peptide repertoire model of interaction. Under this model, the drug binds directly to the antigen presentation region, causing different self peptides to be presented, which trigger an unwanted immune response. There is growing interest in searching for evidence supporting this model for other ADRs using bioinformatics techniques. In this study, in silico docking was used to assess the utility and reliability of well-known docking programs when addressing these challenging HLA-drug situations.

Genetically-controlled plant resistance can reduce the damage caused by pathogens. However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance. This often occurs quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and a continuing need to develop new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolution of pathogen populations and thus increase genetic resistance durability. These strategies mainly rely on varying different combinations of resistance sources across time (crop rotations) and space. The spatial scale of deployment can vary from multiple resistance sources occurring in a single cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within the same field (cultivar mixtures) or in different fields (mosaics). However, experimental comparison of the efficiency (i.e. ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (i.e. ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown) of landscape-scale deployment strategies presents major logistical challenges. Therefore, we developed a spatially explicit stochastic model able to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes of the four major deployment options described above, including both qualitative resistance (i.e. major genes) and quantitative resistance traits against several components of pathogen aggressiveness: infection rate, latent period duration, propagule production rate, and infectious period duration. This model, implemented in the R package &lt;i&gt;landsepi&lt;/i&gt;, provides a new and useful tool to assess the performance of a wide range of deployment options, and helps investigate the effect of landscape, epidemiological and evolutionary parameters. This article describes the model and its parameterisation for rust diseases of cereal crops, caused by fungi of the genus &lt;i&gt;Puccinia&lt;/i&gt;. To illustrate the model, we use it to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary potential of the combination of a major gene and different traits of quantitative resistance. The comparison of the four major deployment strategies described above will be the objective of future studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7LHbywjCaMk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006067</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006067</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162baf3e3ad:bf9d20:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523554968493</crawled><fingerprint>356a8b1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Loup Rimbaud, Julien Papaïx, Jean-François Rey, Luke G.

All you have to do to appreciate the horrors of this field is to step into a lab that does it for a living: stacks and stacks and stacks of plates, each with a slightly different set of conditions (buffers, concentrations, additives, protein construct, and son on) to try, once again, to get a protein crystal that diffracts well enough for structure determination. It’s especially tricky to get the ones with your small molecule sitting inside them at its binding site, but when you do, the payoffs can be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing such things at the quality levels needed, though, is an absolute black art. There are trends (sometimes), better ideas about starting points (sometimes), rational modifications of the protein sequence to increase your chances (sometimes), but in the end, it still comes down to relentless empirical try-it-and-see. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25971&quot;&gt;latest paper&lt;/a&gt; (writeup by &lt;em&gt;C&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i15/Cryo-electron-microscopy-reveals-protein.html?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=CEN&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is looking at a well-known protein crystal (glucose isomerase) that is also well known to exist it two polymorphic forms (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/28/down-at-the-crystal-surface&quot;&gt;that last post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject for more on polymorphs). What isn’t well known is why it forms these particular two types of crystals and how that happens. In virtually every case of polymorphism, we have little or no clue about such things, and I’m very glad to see clues starting to be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these authors have done is to start the crystallization process in ammonium sulfate solution and then freeze the solutions (liquid nitrogen) at various time points, imaging the crystals thus found by electron microscopy. And there are some surprises. At the twenty-second time point, there are already “nanorod” crystals forming, which are, on the average, &lt;em&gt;two protein molecules wide and twelve molecules long&lt;/em&gt;. You are not going to get too much earlier in the crystal formation process than that. The concentration of the nanorods increases over time. However, their length does not: they seem stuck at this size. They do start to associate into fibrils as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other things happening as well. There are other species in there (trimer, tetramers, single-file chains), and after about thirty minutes you can also see faceted nanocrystals of the two known bulk polymorphs, one prismatic and rodlike and one rhombic. The smallest of each are in the 100 nM range along their shortest edges. Trying the experiment using PEG instead of ammonium sulfate (another known set of conditions for producing these protein crystals) shows that the useful concentration range for the additive is much narrower, but in both cases, at the low end of the range you get rhombic, and at the high end you get prismatic. With PEG, though, if you keep pushing it, you get no crystals at all, but rather an amorphous gel-like state. And in none of the PEG experiments did they ever observe the nanorods seen in ammonium sulfate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-264x300.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Nature, C&amp;amp;E News&quot; width=&quot;264&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-264x300.jpeg 264w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-300x341.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals.jpeg 700w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13431&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gelation pathway seemed to involve fibril formation as well, which looked in the earlier experiments like it might be a precursor to formation of the rhombic crystals. Weirdly, the authors found that you can take some of that gel and use it to nucleate another protein solution, one that would otherwise form only the rhombic crystals, and form the prismatic crystals with it instead (which is a bizarre thought to me, and probably to a lot of other people who don’t crystallize things for a living). You actually see the crystals growing out of the surface of the lump of gelatinous protein gorp, as shown at right. This is order out of chaos, for sure; I’ll bet that the temperature of the solution at that interface is changing just to make the thermodynamics of all that loss of entropy work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the early stages of crystal formation like this allowed the authors to come up with all the plausible models of the nanorods and compare those to experimental data. One clearly matches better than the rest of them, so now we know what the earliest crystal formation contacts are, and can start to explain why. The preferred mode of contact buries a lot more negative charges in the protein surface, and the paper goes into detail about how this can explain the effects of sulfate ions in the solution versus PEG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it appears that the prismatic crystals (from ammonium sulfate) are made up of bunches of nanorods, rather than growing molecule-by-molecule, which is also contrary to the mental pictures that many of us have. Meanwhile, the rhombic crystals grow more like the traditional picture, monomer by monomer. The nanorod form, though, can also be trapped in a metastable fibril state, starting off as individual fibrils and going on to a gel, with too high an activation energy to dissociate and form prismatic crystals. But its surface can nucleate the formation of such crystals (as in the above photo). At really high PEG concentrations you get a different gel, which is not composed of fibrils, and seems to be a complete dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they don’t see any evidence for, though, is another mode predicted by theory (and which I mentioned in the last post on this stuff): formation of phase-separated nanodroplets that then crystallize. Those nanodroplets take us back to the hot topic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;protein condensates&lt;/a&gt; inside cells, and perhaps its a good thing that they’re not invariably precursors to forming protein crystals (!) That is very likely the reason that such condensates seem to feature intrinsically disordered proteins as well, to avoid the crystallization problem. . .&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding determinants shaping infection risk of endangered wildlife is a major topic in conservation medicine. The proboscis monkey, &lt;i&gt;Nasalis larvatus&lt;/i&gt;, an endemic primate flagship species for conservation in Borneo, is endangered through habitat loss, but can still be found in riparian lowland and mangrove forests, and in some protected areas. To assess socioecological and anthropogenic influence on intestinal helminth infections in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;larvatus&lt;/i&gt;, 724 fecal samples of harem and bachelor groups, varying in size and the number of juveniles, were collected between June and October 2012 from two study sites in Malaysian Borneo: 634 samples were obtained from groups inhabiting the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS), 90 samples were collected from groups of the Labuk Bay Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary (LBPMS), where monkeys are fed on stationary feeding platforms. Parasite risk was quantified by intestinal helminth prevalence, host parasite species richness (PSR), and eggs per gram feces (epg). Generalized linear mixed effect models were applied to explore whether study site, group type, group size, the number of juveniles per group, and sampling month predict parasite risk. At the LBPMS, prevalence and epg of &lt;i&gt;Trichuris&lt;/i&gt; spp., strongylids, and &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp. but not &lt;i&gt;Ascaris&lt;/i&gt; spp., as well as host PSR were significantly elevated. Only for &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp., prevalence showed significant changes between months; at both sites, the beginning rainy season with increased precipitation was linked to higher prevalence, suggesting the external life cycle of &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp. to benefit from humidity. Higher prevalence, epgs, and PSR within the LBPMS suggest that anthropogenic factors shape host infection risk more than socioecological factors, most likely via higher re-infection rates and chronic stress. Noninvasive measurement of fecal parasite stages is an important tool for assessing transmission dynamics and infection risks for endangered tropical wildlife. Findings will contribute to healthcare management in nature and in anthropogenically managed environments.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Annette Klaus</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195584</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715299:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>d13e25d3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Annette Klaus, Christina Strube, Kathrin Monika Röper, Ute Radespiel, Frank Schaarschmidt, Senthilvel Nathan, Benoit Goossens, Elke Zimmermann&lt;/p&gt;

Muscle atrophy (loss of skeletal muscle mass) causes progressive deterioration of skeletal function. Recently, excessive intake of fats was suggested to induce insulin resistance, followed by muscle atrophy. Green tea extracts (GTEs), which contain polyphenols such as epigallocatechin gallate, have beneficial effects on obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, but their effects against muscle atrophy are still unclear. Here, we found that GTEs prevented high-fat (HF) diet–induced muscle weight loss in senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8), a murine model of senescence. SAMP8 mice were fed a control diet, an HF diet, or HF with 0.5% GTEs (HFGT) diet for 4 months. The HF diet induced muscle weight loss with aging (measured as quadriceps muscle weight), whereas GTEs prevented this loss. In HF diet–fed mice, blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations increased in comparison with the control group, and these mice had insulin resistance as determined by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In these mice, serum concentrations of leukocyte cell–derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), which is known to induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, were elevated, and insulin signaling in muscle, as determined by the phosphorylation levels of Akt and p70 S6 kinases, tended to be decreased. In HFGT diet–fed mice, these signs of insulin resistance and elevation of serum LECT2 were not observed. Although our study did not directly show the effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, insulin resistance examined using HOMA-IR indicated an intervention effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, as revealed by partial correlation analysis. Accordingly, GTEs might have beneficial effects on age-related and HF diet–induced muscle weight loss, which correlates with insulin resistance and is accompanied by a change in serum LECT2.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Shintaro Onishi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195753</canonicalUrl><engagement>5</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a4:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>73992784</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shintaro Onishi, Mayu Ishino, Hidefumi Kitazawa, Ai Yoto, Yuki Shimba, Yusuke Mochizuki, Keiko Unno, Shinichi Meguro, Ichiro Tokimitsu, Shinji Miura&lt;/p&gt;

Pain relief always plays the essential part of perioperative care and an important role of medical quality improvement. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is a method that allows a patient to self-administer small boluses of analgesic to relieve the subjective pain. PCA logs from the infusion pump consisted of a lot of text messages which record all events during the therapies. The dosage information can be extracted from PCA logs to provide easily understanding features. The analysis of dosage information with time has great help to figure out the variance of a patient’s pain relief condition. To explore the trend of pain relief requirement, we developed a PCA dosage information generator (PCA DIG) to extract meaningful messages from PCA logs during the first 48 hours of therapies. PCA dosage information including consumption, delivery, infusion rate, and the ratio between demand and delivery is presented with corresponding values in 4 successive time frames. Time-dependent statistical analysis demonstrated the trends of analgesia requirements decreased gradually along with time. These findings are compatible with clinical observations and further provide valuable information about the strategy to customize postoperative pain management.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>I-Ting Kuo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194140</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e06:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>ee3c05bc</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by I-Ting Kuo, Kuang-Yi Chang, De-Fong Juan, Steen J.

&lt;i&gt;Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum&lt;/i&gt; is a thermophilic anaerobe that has been engineered to produce high amounts of ethanol, reaching ~90% theoretical yield at a titer of 70 g/L. Here we report the physiological changes that occur upon deleting the redox-sensing transcriptional regulator Rex in wild type &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;saccharolyticum&lt;/i&gt;: a single deletion of &lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; resulted in a two-fold increase in ethanol yield (from 40% to 91% theoretical yield), but the resulting strains grew only about a third as fast as the wild type strain. Deletion of the &lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; gene also had the effect of increasing expression of alcohol dehydrogenase genes, &lt;i&gt;adhE&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;adhA&lt;/i&gt;. After several serial transfers, the ethanol yield decreased from an average of 91% to 55%, and the growth rates had increased. We performed whole-genome resequencing to identify secondary mutations in the Δ&lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; strains adapted for faster growth. In several cases, secondary mutations had appeared in the &lt;i&gt;adhE&lt;/i&gt; gene. Furthermore, in these strains the NADH-linked alcohol dehydrogenase activity was greatly reduced.

To grow straight and upright, plants need to regulate actively their posture. Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation (tilting) experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observations of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. The relationship between those oscillations and the postural control of the organ remains unclear, but indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Renaud Bastien</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef06:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>7ec64172</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Renaud Bastien, Olivia Guayasamin, Stéphane Douady, Bruno Moulia&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of the study was to develop Tizanidine HCl (TZN) and Meloxicam (MLX) loaded bilayer mucoadhesive films intended for buccal administration, aiming to enhance the bioavailability. Bilayer films were prepared by solvent evaporation technique selecting arabinoxylan (ARX) as a sustained release (SR) layer forming polymer and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) E-15 as an immediate release (IR) layer-forming polymer. Prepared films were subjected to &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug release, surface morphology, mechanical strength, compatibility of the ingredients, drug contents, &lt;i&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/i&gt; mucoadhesion strength and drug permeation. Crossover study design was applied to study the i&lt;i&gt;n-vivo&lt;/i&gt; pharmacokinetics by using albino rabbits. Various pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; of both drugs loaded in films were compared with standard solution/dispersion administered to the rabbits at the dose of 1mg/kg. The results unveiled instant release and permeation of MLX from IR layer, while good controlled release and permeation characteristics of TZN from SR films over 8 h. films were of uniform thickness with smooth surface and satisfactory mechanical strength. Mucoadhesion strength was sufficient to provide suitable contact time with mucosal membrane. The pharmacokinetic study exhibited prompt absorption of MLX with better AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (6655.64 ng/ml*h vs 6538.99 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (436.98 ng/ml vs 411.33 ng/ml) from oral dispersion. Similarly buccal films has shown enhanced half-life (9.91hr vs 2.51 hr), AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (1043.4 ng/ml*h vs 149.1 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (91.92 ng/ml vs 42.29 ng/ml) from oral solution. A statistical investigation disclosed a significantly improved pharmacokinetics of TZN and MLX after their absorption across buccal route following administration of buccal film &lt;i&gt;(p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05)&lt;/i&gt;.

ARX proved expedient and bilayer buccal films as a drug delivery system ascertained the dual effect of providing instant release of one active agent and persistent release of another one with improved pharmacokinetics.</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Development of Tizanidine HCl-Meloxicam loaded mucoadhesive buccal films: &amp;lt;i&gt;In-vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;in-vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; evaluation</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194744</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194744</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194744</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Luisa Bracci, Elisabetta Mandarini, Jlenia Brunetti, Lorenzo Depau, Alessandro Pini, Lucia Terzuoli, Silvia Scali, Chiara Falciani&lt;/p&gt;
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, HSPGs, modulate major transformations of cancer cells, leading to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis.

Diverse plant pathogens export effector proteins to reprogram host cells. One of the most challenging goals in the molecular plant-microbe field is to functionally characterize the complex repertoires of effectors secreted by these pathogens. For bacterial pathogens, the predominant class of effectors is delivered to host cells by Type III secretion. For oomycetes, the predominant class of effectors is defined by a signal peptide that mediates secretion from the oomycete and a conserved RxLR motif. Downy mildew pathogens and &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/i&gt; species maintain hundreds of candidate RxLR effector genes in their genomes. Although no primary sequence similarity is evident between bacterial Type III effectors (T3Es) and oomycete RXLR effectors, some bacterial and oomycete effectors have convergently evolved to target the same host proteins. Such effectors might have evolved domains that are functionally similar but sequence-unrelated. We reasoned that alignment-free bioinformatics approaches could be useful to identify structural similarities between bacterial and oomycete effectors. To test this approach, we used partial least squares regression, alignment-free bioinformatics methods to identify effector proteins from the genome of the oomycete &lt;i&gt;Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis&lt;/i&gt; that are similar to the well-studied AvrE1 effector from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. This approach identified five RxLR proteins with putative structural similarity to AvrE1. We focused on one, HaRxL23, because it is an experimentally validated effector and it is conserved between distantly related oomycetes. Several experiments indicate that HaRxL23 is functionally similar to AvrE1, including the ability to partially rescue an AvrE1 loss-of-function mutant. This study provides an example of how an alignment-free bioinformatics approach can identify functionally similar effector proteins in the absence of primary sequence similarity. This approach could be useful to identify effectors that have convergently evolved regardless of whether the shared host target is known.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Devdutta Deb</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195559</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd91:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>48434103</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Devdutta Deb, David Mackey, Stephen O.

Microbes usually exist in communities consisting of myriad different but interacting species. These interactions are typically mediated through environmental modifications; microbes change the environment by taking up resources and excreting metabolites, which affects the growth of both themselves and also other microbes. We show here that the way microbes modify their environment and react to it sets the interactions within single-species populations and also between different species. A very common environmental modification is a change of the environmental pH. We find experimentally that these pH changes create feedback loops that can determine the fate of bacterial populations; they can either facilitate or inhibit growth, and in extreme cases will cause extinction of the bacterial population. Understanding how single species change the pH and react to these changes allowed us to estimate their pairwise interaction outcomes. Those interactions lead to a set of generic interaction motifs—bistability, successive growth, extended suicide, and stabilization—that may be independent of which environmental parameter is modified and thus may reoccur in different microbial systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/64piOgqCVHQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004248</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004248</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162259eed6a:49391f:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521049595242</crawled><fingerprint>de71fdc3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christoph Ratzke, Jeff Gore&lt;/p&gt;

Time delays are known to play a crucial role in generating biological oscillations. The early embryonic cell cycle in the frog &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; is one such example. Although various mathematical models of this oscillating system exist, it is not clear how to best model the required time delay. Here, we study a simple cell cycle model that produces oscillations due to the presence of an ultrasensitive, time-delayed negative feedback loop. We implement the time delay in three qualitatively different ways, using a fixed time delay, a distribution of time delays, and a delay that is state-dependent. We analyze the dynamics in all cases, and we use experimental observations to interpret our results and put constraints on unknown parameters. In doing so, we find that different implementations of the time delay can have a large impact on the resulting oscillations.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Jan Rombouts</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194769</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f7:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>cea53886</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jan Rombouts, Alexandra Vandervelde, Lendert Gelens&lt;/p&gt;

Supplying food for the anticipated global population of over 9 billion in 2050 under changing climate conditions is one of the major challenges of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. Agricultural expansion and intensification contributes to global environmental change and risks the long-term sustainability of the planet. It has been proposed that no more than 15% of the global ice-free land surface should be converted to cropland. Bioenergy production for land-based climate mitigation places additional pressure on limited land resources. Here we test normative targets of food supply and bioenergy production within the cropland planetary boundary using a global land-use model. The results suggest supplying the global population with adequate food is possible without cropland expansion exceeding the planetary boundary. Yet this requires an increase in food production, especially in developing countries, as well as a decrease in global crop yield gaps. However, under current assumptions of future food requirements, it was not possible to also produce significant amounts of first generation bioenergy without cropland expansion. These results suggest that meeting food and bioenergy demands within the planetary boundaries would need a shift away from current trends, for example, requiring major change in the demand-side of the food system or advancing biotechnologies.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease, which is defined as having a reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and/or signs of kidney damage (albuminuria), is highly prevalent in Western society and is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. This warrants a search for risk factors of lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. Physical activity and sedentary behavior may be such risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine associations of physical activity (total, high, low), sedentary time and sedentary behavior patterns (breaks, prolonged bouts, average bout duration) with eGFR and albuminuria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We examined these associations in 2,258 participants of the Maastricht Study (average age 60.1±8.1 years; 51.3% men), who wore an accelerometer 24h/day on 7 consecutive days. Associations with continuous eGFR and categories of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; &amp;lt;15 [reference category], 15-&amp;lt;30, ≥30 mg/24h) were evaluated with linear regression analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After adjustment for potential confounders, each extra hour of total physical activity was associated with a more favorable kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.30 (95%CI = 1.46; 3.14)), whereas each extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with a more adverse kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.71 (-1.08; -0.35)). Also, compared to individuals with the lowest levels of total physical activity, individuals with the highest levels had less kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.63 (0.41; 0.96), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.84 (0.53; 1.35). An extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with more kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.11 (1.01; 1.22), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.10 (0.99; 1.22)). Further, a highly sedentary pattern was associated with a more adverse kidney function, but no association was seen with kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Physical activity and sedentary behavior were associated with kidney function and kidney damage. Additionally, sedentary behavior patterns were associated with kidney function. Causal studies are required to examine whether this indeed implicates that prevention strategies should focus not only on increasing physical activity, but on reducing sedentary behavior as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Remy J.

Causal studies are required to examine whether this indeed implicates that prevention strategies should focus not only on increasing physical activity, but on reducing sedentary behavior as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522875600000</published><title>Amount and pattern of physical activity and sedentary behavior are associated with kidney function and kidney damage: The Maastricht Study</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195381</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195381</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195381</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Simone Samuelsen, Christian Damsgaard Jørgensen, Elizabeth D.

In this study, we developed a series of synthetic oligonucleotides that allowed us to investigate the details on the antigen recognition by autoimmune antibodies in localized scleroderma subjects. Besides dramatically improved analytical specificity of the assay, our data suggests a potential linking for antibodies to DNA to the biological status of disease state in localized scleroderma. Moreover, introducing chemical modifications into short synthetic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules completely changed the binding titers of corresponding antibodies and their clinical relevance. The strongest observed effect was registered for the localized scleroderma skin damage index (LoSDI) on the IgG antibodies to TC dinucleotide-rich double-stranded antigen (p &amp;lt; 0.001). In addition to providing valuable tools for diagnosis of clinically relevant biomarkers, we believe that this work opens up new opportunities for research on antibodies to nucleic acids in localized scleroderma and other autoimmune diseases.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Simone Samuelsen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195381</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd8b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>f51d22cb</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Simone Samuelsen, Christian Damsgaard Jørgensen, Elizabeth D.

With the exploitation of offshore oil and gas gradually moving to deep water, higher temperature differences and pressure differences are applied to the pipeline system, making the global buckling of the pipeline more serious. For unburied deep-water pipelines, the lateral buckling is the major buckling form. The initial imperfections widely exist in the pipeline system due to manufacture defects or the influence of uneven seabed, and the distribution and geometry features of initial imperfections are random. They can be divided into two kinds based on shape: single-arch imperfections and double-arch imperfections. This paper analyzed the global buckling process of a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections by using a numerical simulation method and revealed how the ratio of the initial imperfection’s space length to the imperfection’s wavelength and the combination of imperfections affects the buckling process. The results show that a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections may suffer the superposition of global buckling. The growth ratios of buckling displacement, axial force and bending moment in the superposition zone are several times larger than no buckling superposition pipeline. The ratio of the initial imperfection’s space length to the imperfection’s wavelength decides whether a pipeline suffers buckling superposition. The potential failure point of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is as same as the no buckling superposition pipeline, but the failure risk of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is much higher. The shape and direction of two nearby imperfections also affects the failure risk of pipeline exhibiting global buckling superposition. The failure risk of pipeline with two double-arch imperfections is higher than pipeline with two single-arch imperfections.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Wenbin Liu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194426</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f9:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>1f530e1b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wenbin Liu, Aimin Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Although tau pathology, behavioral deficits, and neuronal loss are observed in patients with tauopathies, the relationship between these endpoints has not been clearly established. Here we found that rTg4510 mice, which overexpress human mutant tau in the forebrain, develop progressive age-dependent increases in locomotor activity (LMA), which correlates with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, hyperphosphorylated tau levels, and brain atrophy. To further clarify the relationship between these endpoints, we treated the rTg4510 mice with either doxycycline to reduce mutant tau expression or an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor Thiamet G, which has been shown to ameliorate tau pathology in animal models. We found that both doxycycline and Thiamet G treatments starting at 2 months of age prevented the progression of hyperactivity, slowed brain atrophy, and reduced brain hyperphosphorylated tau. In contrast, initiating doxycycline treatment at 4 months reduced neither brain hyperphosphorylated tau nor hyperactivity, further confirming the relationship between these measures. Collectively, our results demonstrate a unique behavioral phenotype in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy that strongly correlates with disease progression, and that early interventions which reduce tau pathology ameliorate the progression of the locomotor dysfunction. These findings suggest that better understanding the relationship between locomotor deficits and tau pathology in the rTg4510 model may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying behavioral disturbances in patients with tauopathies.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Xiaohai Wang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195486</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd07f:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>b761e70b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaohai Wang, Karen Smith, Michelle Pearson, Anna Hughes, Mali L.

Functional phylogenomics predicts defined steps in the evolution of response system properties, and comparative transcriptomics across six ancient lineages revealed how these innovations shaped a sophisticated response mechanism. Genetic analysis in a basal land plant revealed unexpected contributions of ancient non-canonical proteins in auxin response as well as auxin-unrelated function of core transcription factors.

Functional phylogenomics predicts defined steps in the evolution of response system properties, and comparative transcriptomics across six ancient lineages revealed how these innovations shaped a sophisticated response mechanism. Genetic analysis in a basal land plant revealed unexpected contributions of ancient non-canonical proteins in auxin response as well as auxin-unrelated function of core transcription factors. Our study provides a functional evolutionary framework for understanding diverse functions of the auxin signal.</description><published>1522108800000</published><title>Origin and evolution of the nuclear auxin response system</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16208</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16208</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/9r6RJdTgBg4/ncomms16208</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Experimental orthotopic transplantation of a tissue-engineered oesophagus in rats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Experimental orthotopic transplantation of a tissue-engineered oesophagus in rats, Published online: 10 April 2018;

This study aimed to determine the effect of metabolic syndrome (MS) on the reproductive function in fertile (FM) and male partners of infertile couples (MPIC). We performed a cross-sectional study formatting two study groups: partners of pregnant women (n = 238; mean age 32.0) as FM and male partners of infertile couples (n = 2642; mean age 32.6) as MPIC. A standard semen analysis was performed and clinical, laboratory and lifestyle data were analysed. The adapted NCEP-ATPIII criteria were used to define MS. 12.2% of FM and 17.8% of MPIC had MS. In both groups, men with MS were older, they were centrally obese and had higher triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and decreased HDL cholesterol values as compared to men without MS. However, glucose concentrations as well as fasting insulin levels were significantly higher only in the MPIC-MS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; group. MS was not associated with semen parameters. Testosterone levels were negatively correlated to MS in both groups. This negative association persisted within the BMI categories between MPIC-MS&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and MPIC-MS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups. LH was negatively correlated to MS but only in MPIC.

Active DNA loop extrusion by SMC complexes may provide the universal unifying principle for genome organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522950073000</published><title>Real-time imaging of DNA loop extrusion by condensin</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4513</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4513</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/PH6PH8DgSE4/nm.4513</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A public antibody lineage that potently inhibits malaria infection through dual binding to the circumsporozoite protein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A public antibody lineage that potently inhibits malaria infection through dual binding to the circumsporozoite protein, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4513&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm.4513&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Volunteers who develop protection against malaria produce potent antibodies binding to a site of vulnerability on the parasite circumsporozoite protein that is absent in vaccines currently being tested in humans&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/PH6PH8DgSE4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Joshua Tan</name></author><engagement>13</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4513</link><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_1623f181cda:277b3b0:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521476967642</crawled><fingerprint>571e1eb0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A public antibody lineage that potently inhibits malaria infection through dual binding to the circumsporozoite protein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A public antibody lineage that potently inhibits malaria infection through dual binding to the circumsporozoite protein, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4513&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm.4513&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Volunteers who develop protection against malaria produce potent antibodies binding to a site of vulnerability on the parasite circumsporozoite protein that is absent in vaccines currently being tested in humans&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/PH6PH8DgSE4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1521442800000</published><title>A public antibody lineage that potently inhibits malaria infection through dual binding to the circumsporozoite protein</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03791-y</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03791-y</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/s7G6aABJGMs/s41467-018-03791-y</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conditional privatization of a public siderophore enables &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; to resist cheater invasion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditional privatization of a public siderophore enables &amp;lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&amp;lt;/i&gt; to resist cheater invasion, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03791-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03791-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Pyoverdine is secreted by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa to scavenge iron from its hosts.

Two recent papers do exactly that, and I’m going to propose combining them for even more instrumental craziness. The first covers a class of cellular structure that I had no idea even existed, even though it’s been studied for many years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC372955/&quot;&gt;bacterial gas vesicles&lt;/a&gt;. There are species of aquatic bacteria (and Archaea) that produce hollow protein structures (some 200 nM long) whose walls are so hydrophobic that they exclude water and are too tight to let larger hydrophobic compounds in. What does that leave them to be filled with? Gases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria produce these to regulate their density and maintain buoyancy; they’re basically nanoscale swim bladders. But as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593117301898&quot;&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt; shows, there are people taking advantage of these structures for imaging. The contrast between the gas phase and the cytosol makes these structures available for ultrasound detection, and I have to salute the first person to whom that unusual thought occurred. Micron-scale bubbles (stabilized by lipid or protein) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818980/&quot;&gt;are used as&lt;/a&gt; an ultrasound contrast agent, so it makes sense, and in 2014 a Berkeley/Toronto team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4023545/&quot;&gt;showed that&lt;/a&gt; it works quite well. In fact, different sorts of vesicles from different species can be distinguished by their ultrasound behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could get cells to produce such things for you on demand, you’d have a shot at an ultrasound reporter gene construct (of all things). It’s not easy. The gas vesicles actually need several genes to produce the mix of proteins in their walls, and getting everything to express and assemble properly seems to have taken some experimentation, but a report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25021&quot;&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; shows that conventional disease bacteria can be made to express them and they can be detected in turn to localize the organisms &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these vesicles can also be exploited for another detection method: NMR. Air-filled regions have high contrast in T2 magnetic resonance imaging, and with sufficient resolution, you could pick up these gas vesicles as well. The review paper mentions another possibility – allowing these to fill with hyperpolarized xenon – that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1934&quot;&gt;also been realized&lt;/a&gt; by the same group (now at CalTech). This gives &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490238/&quot;&gt;huge gains&lt;/a&gt; in sensitivity, as hyperpolarized species do (normally only a tiny fraction of the potential atoms can be observed in a regular NMR experiment; this makes everything signal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentioning NMR, though, brings me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25781&quot;&gt;another recent paper&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/02/04/singlecell_nmr_how_about_singleprotein_nmr&quot;&gt;a while back&lt;/a&gt; about an exotic NMR possibility, using spin-defect diamond crystals as detectors, that could possibly lead to NMR detection in very small volumes (such as a single cell or even smaller). Here’s a paper from a Harvard/MIT collaboration that’s taking this much closer to reality. The problem with using a single spin defect center is that while you can detect NMR signals in a very small volume, the resolution is poor (100 Hz or so under the best conditions). NMR-using chemists will recognize that as very fuzzy indeed – you can get vastly better spectral resolution on a 1970s electromagnet NMR, although you’re not going to be picking up any single-cell-volume signals with it, to be fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new paper uses several of these unpaired-electron defects in an array, along with a much fancier overall method (coherently averaged synchronized readout, CASR, which I do not understand this morning well enough to describe). What is immediately apparent, though, is that they’re getting real NMR spectra of small test molecules (ethyl formate, xylene, glycerol, trimethyl phosphate) in picoliter-sized volumes of sample. There are many more refinements that are possible to the technique, and the authors seems hopeful (well, as authors generally are, admittedly) that the method will indeed be able to realize single-cell NMR experiments, multiplexed experiments across parallel detectors for bulk samples, and other completely new fields of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d think that these two techniques would work very well together –  the extreme spatial resolution of the diamond-defect detectors with the gas vesicles inside single cells. (I haven’t even mentioned another NMR possibility that’s explored in that review article I started with, the idea of using aquaporins as NMR reporters). If we really do get down to that kind of resolution, all sorts of other exotic ideas will surely swim into view. This gets to &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6113/1426.summary&quot;&gt;Freeman Dyson’s point&lt;/a&gt; about “tool-driven revolutions” &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/chemistry-galisonian-rather-than-kuhnian/&quot;&gt;rather than&lt;/a&gt; concept-driven ones. Build a new instrument, that does new things and gives you new ways of looking at the world, and new concepts will follow.

&lt;i&gt;Camellia nitidissima&lt;/i&gt; Chi (CNC) is a valuable medicinal and edible plant in China. In this study, CNC flowers were extracted with 95% ethanol, then partitioned into dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol, and water fractions, with the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and other phytochemicals in CNC flowers investigated for the first time. Results showed that the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity and highest total phenolic content (TPC) compared with the other fractions.

&lt;i&gt;Camellia nitidissima&lt;/i&gt; Chi (CNC) is a valuable medicinal and edible plant in China. In this study, CNC flowers were extracted with 95% ethanol, then partitioned into dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol, and water fractions, with the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and other phytochemicals in CNC flowers investigated for the first time. Results showed that the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity and highest total phenolic content (TPC) compared with the other fractions. Furthermore, in the ethyl acetate fraction, the 50% effective concentrations (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of ABTS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and DPPH radical scavenging activities were 64.24 ± 1.80 and 78.80 ± 0.34 μg/mL, respectively, and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was 801.49 ± 2.30 μM FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 1,000 μg/mL.

As predominant components of hemicelluloses in grasses, methylglucuroarabinoxylans (MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are sources for the production of acidic xylooligosaccharides (U-XOS). &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; MR44, an engineered biocatalyst to secrete only the XynC xylanase and Axh43 arabinoxylan hydrolase is capable of processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to exclusively U-XOS. The present studies are directed at the explosion on direct alkaline extraction serving for production of U-XOS. Response Surface Methodology was used to optimize xylan extraction conditions on the sweet sorghum bagasse to achieve maximum hemicelluloses yield. The optimized condition was as follows: extraction time of 3.91 h, extraction temperature of 86.1°C, and NaOH concentration (w/w) of 12.33%. Crude xylan extracted with NaOH revealed a compositional analysis of xylose (79.0%), arabinose (5.3%), glucose (1.7%), lignin and ash (5.6%). After neutralization this xylan preparation supported growth of MR44, processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; from sweet sorghum and accumulating U-XOS. The quality of U-XOS produced by MR44 using alkaline-treated sweet sorghum bagasse was comparable to that obtained from purified MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Overall, the present study demonstrates that direct alkaline treatment of sweet sorghum bagasse is useful to improve the bioavailability of MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for MR44-mediated conversion to U-XOS with average degrees of polymerization of 11–12, providing alternative resources with applications in nutrition and human and veterinary medicine.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Lusha Wei</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b7:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>15cb0e85</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lusha Wei, Tongjing Yan, Yifei Wu, Hui Chen, Baoshan Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Ascorbic acid (AsA), chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and their associated gene expression patterns were analysed in &lt;i&gt;Actinidia chinensis&lt;/i&gt; ‘Hongyang’ outer pericarp. The results showed chlorophyll degradation during fruit development and softening, exposed the yellow carotenoid pigments. &lt;i&gt;LHCB1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CLS1&lt;/i&gt; gene expressions were decreased, while &lt;i&gt;PPH2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPH3&lt;/i&gt; gene expressions were increased, indicating that downregulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis and upregulation of its degradation, caused chlorophyll degradation.

Global introductions of aquatic species and their associated pathogens are threatening worldwide biodiversity. The introduction of two North American crayfish species, &lt;i&gt;Procambarus clarkii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pacifastacus leniusculus&lt;/i&gt;, into Japan in 1927 seems to have negatively affected native Japanese crayfish populations of &lt;i&gt;Cambaroides japonicus&lt;/i&gt;. Several studies have shown the decline of these native populations due to competition, predation and habitat colonization by the two invasive North American crayfish species. Here, we identify an additional factor contributing to this decline. We report the first crayfish plague outbreaks in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonicus&lt;/i&gt; populations in Japan, which were diagnosed using both histological and molecular approaches (analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region). Subsequent analyses of the mitochondrial ribosomal rnnS and rnnL regions of diseased specimens indicate that these outbreaks originated from a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt; population and identify a novel haplotype of &lt;i&gt;Aphanomyces astaci&lt;/i&gt;, d3-haplotype, hosted by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt;.

The red flour beetle, &lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/i&gt;, is an important model insect and agricultural pest. However, many standard genetic tools are lacking or underdeveloped in this system. Here, we present a set of new reagents to augment existing &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; genetic tools. We demonstrate a new GAL4 driver line that employs the promoter of a ribosomal protein gene to drive expression of a UAS responder in the fat body. We also present a novel dual fluorescent reporter that labels cell membranes and nuclei with different fluorophores for the analysis of cellular morphology. This approach also demonstrates the functionality of the viral T2A peptide for bicistronic gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt;. To facilitate classical genetic analysis, we created lines with visible genetic markers by CRISPR-mediated disruption of the &lt;i&gt;yellow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ebony&lt;/i&gt; body color loci with a cassette carrying an attP site, enabling future φC31-mediated integration. Together, the reagents presented here will facilitate more robust genetic analysis in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; and serve as a blueprint for the further development of this powerful model’s genetic toolkit.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Johnathan C.

A chemical and microbiological characterization on &lt;i&gt;Hermetia illucens&lt;/i&gt; larvae was carried out as well as an inactivation study of natural contaminating microorganisms and inoculated &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 in black soldier larvae by using High Hydrostatic Pressure (250 to 400 MPa, for 1.5 to 15 min). &lt;i&gt;Hermetia illucens&lt;/i&gt; was mainly composed of proteins (46.49%, d.m.) followed by fat (37.88%, d.m.). Larvae had a high contamination load of Total Aerobic Mesophilic bacteria (AMB) (1.58x10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cfu/g) and Enterobacteriaceae (1.15x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;cfu/g). The presence of pathogenic microorganism varied: no &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; spp. were found, but &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; (1.15x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cfu/g) and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (7.08x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cfu/g) were detected in the larvae extract. High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) was effective against natural contaminating yeasts and molds producing more than 5 log cycle reductions at 400 MPa for any of the times considered (2.5 to 7 min), but a low reduction of total microbial load was achieved. The inactivation level of larvae inoculated with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 varied. At 400 MPa for 7 min more than 5 log cycle reductions were achieved. Among the three inactivation models studied, the one that best described the inactivation pattern of the cells, according to the Akaike index, was the Biphasic model.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Mahboobeh Kashiri</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194477</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:412392b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>b2324f70</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mahboobeh Kashiri, Cuauhtemoc Marin, Raquel Garzón, Cristina M.

The presence of pathogenic microorganism varied: no &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; spp. were found, but &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; (1.15x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cfu/g) and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (7.08x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cfu/g) were detected in the larvae extract. High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) was effective against natural contaminating yeasts and molds producing more than 5 log cycle reductions at 400 MPa for any of the times considered (2.5 to 7 min), but a low reduction of total microbial load was achieved. The inactivation level of larvae inoculated with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 varied. At 400 MPa for 7 min more than 5 log cycle reductions were achieved. Among the three inactivation models studied, the one that best described the inactivation pattern of the cells, according to the Akaike index, was the Biphasic model.</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Use of high hydrostatic pressure to inactivate natural contaminating microorganisms and inoculated &amp;lt;i&gt;E&amp;lt;/i&gt;. &amp;lt;i&gt;coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 on &amp;lt;i&gt;Hermetia illucens&amp;lt;/i&gt; larvae</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195163</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195163</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195163</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kelli Stidham Hall, Emmanuel Morhe, Abubakar Manu, Lisa H.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Using our previously developed and tested Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Stigma Scale, we investigated factors associated with perceived SRH stigma among adolescent girls in Ghana.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We drew upon data from our survey study of 1,063 females 15-24yrs recruited from community- and clinic-based sites in two Ghanaian cities. Our Adolescent SRH Stigma Scale comprised 20 items and 3 sub-scales (Internalized, Enacted, Lay Attitudes) to measure stigma occurring with sexual activity, contraceptive use, pregnancy, abortion and family planning service use. We assessed relationships between a comprehensive set of demographic, health and social factors and SRH Stigma with multi-level multivariable linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In unadjusted bivariate analyses, compared to their counterparts, SRH stigma scores were higher among girls who were younger, Accra residents, Muslim, still in/dropped out of secondary school, unemployed, reporting excellent/very good health, not in a relationship, not sexually experienced, never received family planning services, never used contraception, but had been pregnant (all p-values &amp;lt;0.05). In multivariable models, higher SRH stigma scores were associated with history of pregnancy (β = 1.53, CI = 0.51,2.56) and excellent/very good self-rated health (β = 0.89, CI = 0.20,1.58), while lower stigma scores were associated with older age (β = -0.17, 95%CI = -0.24,-0.09), higher educational attainment (β = -1.22, CI = -1.82,-0.63), and sexual intercourse experience (β = -1.32, CI = -2.10,-0.55).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings provide insight into factors contributing to SRH stigma among this young Ghanaian female sample.

The quality of biological samples greatly affects the accuracy of scientific results. However, RNA in cryopreserved tissues gradually degrades during storage, leading to errors in the results of subsequent experiments. A suitable sample preservative solution can prolong storage and enhance the research value of samples. Here, we developed a sample preservative solution using the properties of the ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (RVC) and compared its effects on RNA and DNA quality, protein activity, and tissue morphology with the commercially available and widely used RNAlater® Stabilization Solution. The results showed that both the RVC-based preservative solution and RNAlater can effectively delay RNA degradation in tissue samples stored at 4°C or −80°C compared with samples stored without any preservative solution. In contrast to RNAlater, the RVC-based preservative solution did not result in damage to the tissue morphology or a loss of protein activity. Additionally, the RVC-based preservative solution did not affect the RNA and genomic DNA contents of the tissue samples or the results of subsequent experimental analyses. An RVC-based reagent can be used as a multifunctional yet relatively inexpensive tissue preservative solution to provide a comprehensive and cost-effective method for preserving samples for tissue banks.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Tzong-Ming Shieh</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194393</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16225a89689:4e33a2:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><fingerprint>4fd8268</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tzong-Ming Shieh, Chi-Yuan Chen, Chuen Hsueh, Cheng-Chia Yu, Chin-Chuan Chen, Tong-Hong Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Climate change is expected to affect resource-consumer interactions underlying stability in polar food webs. Polar benthic organisms have adapted to the marked seasonality characterising their habitats by concentrating foraging and reproductive activity in summer months, when inputs from sympagic and pelagic producers increase. While this enables the persistence of biodiverse food webs, the mechanisms underlying changes in resource use and nutrient transfer are poorly understood. Thus, our understanding of how temporal and spatial variations in the supply of resources may affect food web structure and functioning is limited. By means of C and N isotopic analyses of two key Antarctic benthic consumers (&lt;i&gt;Adamussium colbecki&lt;/i&gt;, Bivalvia, and &lt;i&gt;Sterechinus neumayeri&lt;/i&gt;, Echinoidea) and Bayesian mixing models, we describe changes in trophic niche and nutrient transfer across trophic levels associated with the long- and short-term diet and body size of specimens sampled in midsummer in both shallow and deep waters. Samplings occurred soon after the sea-ice broke up at Tethys Bay, an area characterised by extreme seasonality in sea-ice coverage and productivity in the Ross Sea. In the long term, the trophic niche was broader and variation between specimens was greater, with intermediate-size specimens generally consuming a higher number of resources than small and large specimens. The coupling of energy channels in the food web was consequently more direct than in the short term. Sediment and benthic algae were more frequently consumed in the long term, before the sea-ice broke up, while consumers specialised on sympagic algae and plankton in the short term. Regardless of the time scale, sympagic algae were more frequently consumed in shallow waters, while plankton was more frequently consumed in deep waters. Our results suggest a strong temporal relationship between resource availability and the trophic niche of benthic consumers in Antarctica. Potential climate-driven changes in the timing and quality of nutrient inputs may have profound implications for the structure of polar food webs and the persistence of their constituent species, which have adapted their trophic niches to a highly predictable schedule of resource inputs.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Edoardo Calizza</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194796</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51d4:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>4f3e0082</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Edoardo Calizza, Giulio Careddu, Simona Sporta Caputi, Loreto Rossi, Maria Letizia Costantini&lt;/p&gt;

Gari, a fermented and dried semolina made from cassava, is one of the most common foods in West Africa. Recently introduced biofortified yellow cassava containing provitamin A carotenoids could help tackle vitamin A deficiency prevalent in those areas. However there are concerns because of the low retention of carotenoids during gari processing compared to other processes (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. boiling). The aim of the study was to assess the levels of true retention in &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;–β-carotene during gari processing and investigate the causes of low retention. Influence of processing step, processor (3 commercial processors) and variety (TMS 01/1371; 01/1368 and 01/1412) were assessed. It was shown that low true retention (46% on average) during gari processing may be explained by not only chemical losses (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. due to roasting temperature) but also by physical losses (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. due to leaching of carotenoids in discarded liquids): true retention in the liquid lost from grating negatively correlated with true retention retained in the mash (R = -0.914). Moreover, true retention followed the same pattern as lost water at the different processing steps (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. for the commercial processors). Variety had a significant influence on true retention, carotenoid content, and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerisation but the processor type had little effect. It is the first time that the importance of physical carotenoid losses was demonstrated during processing of biofortified crops.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Aurélie Bechoff</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194402</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087e7:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><fingerprint>742e1ead</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aurélie Bechoff, Keith Ian Tomlins, Ugo Chijioke, Paul Ilona, Andrew Westby, Erick Boy&lt;/p&gt;

It was shown that low true retention (46% on average) during gari processing may be explained by not only chemical losses (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. due to roasting temperature) but also by physical losses (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. due to leaching of carotenoids in discarded liquids): true retention in the liquid lost from grating negatively correlated with true retention retained in the mash (R = -0.914). Moreover, true retention followed the same pattern as lost water at the different processing steps (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. for the commercial processors). Variety had a significant influence on true retention, carotenoid content, and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerisation but the processor type had little effect. It is the first time that the importance of physical carotenoid losses was demonstrated during processing of biofortified crops.</description><published>1521666000000</published><title>Physical losses could partially explain modest carotenoid retention in dried food products from biofortified cassava</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03584-3</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03584-3</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/-Qmosm4DXqc/s41467-018-03584-3</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oncofetal gene &lt;i&gt;SALL4&lt;/i&gt; reactivation by hepatitis B virus counteracts miR-200c in PD-L1-induced T cell exhaustion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oncofetal gene &amp;lt;i&gt;SALL4&amp;lt;/i&gt; reactivation by hepatitis B virus counteracts miR-200c in PD-L1-induced T cell exhaustion, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03584-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03584-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Blocking PD-1 function on T cells is thought to be a viable strategy to prevent virus-induced or tumor-induced T cell exhaustion.

Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a risk factor of osteoporotic fracture (OF). Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) can differentiate into osteoclasts to resorb bone. It was known that PBM-expressed Anxa2 protein is associated with BMD, and extracellular Anxa2 protein promotes osteoclastogenesis. This study aimed to test 1) whether Anxa2 protein level in PBM differs significantly between subjects with OF and without fracture history (NF); 2) whether Anxa2 level in plasma is associated with BMD; 3) how Anxa2 protein at various concentrations would affect osteoblastic activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. All the study subjects were Chinese Han elderly. Firstly, Anxa2 protein in PBM was identified and quantitated by LC-MS/MS and compared between 45 OF cases and 42 healthy controls. Secondly, plasma Anxa2 protein level was quantitated by ELISA and compared between unrelated subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD (0.63±0.10 vs. 1.05±0.10 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, n = 75). Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; functional assay was utilized to test the effects of extracellular Anxa2 protein on osteoblastic growth. We found that Anxa2 protein expression in PBM was significantly up-regulated in OF vs. NF subjects (fold change [FC)] = 1.16, P&amp;lt;0.05). Plasma Anxa2 protein concentration (range: 31.69–227.35ng/ml) was significantly elevated in low vs. high BMD subjects (84.85 vs. 66.15ng/ml, FC = 1.28, P&amp;lt;0.05). Cellular dynamical monitoring demonstrated that the general shape of dose-response relationship is the inverse U-shaped curve. Specifically, lower dose of Anxa2 protein may promote osteoblast growth and the optimal concentration for osteoblastic growth was around 50ng/ml, but even higher concentration could attenuate hFOB1.19 osteoprogenitor cell growth. We concluded that Anxa2 protein could attenuate osteoblast growth and be associated with hip BMD and OF in Chinese elderly.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Xu Zhou</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194781</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51d1:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>2885684e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xu Zhou, Long-Fei Wu, Wen-Yu Wang, Xin Lu, Zhen-Huan Jiang, Yun-Hong Zhang, Ding-Hua Jiang, Jian-Nong Jiang, Hong-Qing Gao, Shu-Feng Lei, Fei-Yan Deng&lt;/p&gt;

Functional Theory study, including Hubbard +U correction (DFT+U), investigates the

Surface free energy calculations show the stability of perfect TiN-TiO2

adsorbed dissociatively at perfect and oxygen defective interfaces while
molecular adsorption is more stable at higher coverages. The adsorption energy
is stronger at the oxygen defective interfaces which arises from the high
concentration of reduced Ti3+ and strong interfacial atomic
relaxations. Ab initio atomistic thermodynamics show that water will be present
at high coverage on TiO2-TiN interfaces at ambient conditions and
the pristine interface is only stable at very low pressure of O and H2O.

Dysregulation of TGF-β signaling causes various diseases, such as cancer and fibrosis. SMAD2 and SMAD3 are core transcription factors involved in TGF-β signaling, and they form heterotrimeric complexes with SMAD4 (SMAD2-SMAD2-SMAD4, SMAD3-SMAD3-SMAD4, and SMAD2-SMAD3-SMAD4) in response to TGF-β signaling. These heterotrimeric complexes interact with cofactors to control the expression of TGF-β–dependent genes. SMAD2 and SMAD3 may promote or repress target genes depending on whether they form complexes with other transcription factors, coactivators, or corepressors; therefore, the selection of specific cofactors is critical for the appropriate activity of these transcription factors. To reveal the structural basis by which SMAD2 and SMAD3 select cofactors, we determined the crystal structures of SMAD3 in complex with the transcription factor FOXH1 and SMAD2 in complex with the transcriptional corepressor SKI. The structures of the complexes show that the MAD homology 2 (MH2) domains of SMAD2 and SMAD3 have multiple hydrophobic patches on their surfaces. The cofactors tether to various subsets of these patches to interact with SMAD2 and SMAD3 in a cooperative or competitive manner to control the output of TGF-β signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Miyazono, K.-i., Moriwaki, S., Ito, T., Kurisaki, A., Asashima, M., Tanokura, M.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/523/eaao7227.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>RuJRIXzN26JgDGk9YhlIBfh4YrPi0r+1c4exm9G1IBw=_16268b24d05:62ff817:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522174938373</crawled><fingerprint>5e5f3a7</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Signaling current issue</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;The transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) superfamily of cytokines regulates various biological processes, including cell proliferation, immune responses, autophagy, and senescence.

These heterotrimeric complexes interact with cofactors to control the expression of TGF-β–dependent genes. SMAD2 and SMAD3 may promote or repress target genes depending on whether they form complexes with other transcription factors, coactivators, or corepressors; therefore, the selection of specific cofactors is critical for the appropriate activity of these transcription factors. To reveal the structural basis by which SMAD2 and SMAD3 select cofactors, we determined the crystal structures of SMAD3 in complex with the transcription factor FOXH1 and SMAD2 in complex with the transcriptional corepressor SKI. The structures of the complexes show that the MAD homology 2 (MH2) domains of SMAD2 and SMAD3 have multiple hydrophobic patches on their surfaces. The cofactors tether to various subsets of these patches to interact with SMAD2 and SMAD3 in a cooperative or competitive manner to control the output of TGF-β signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522173313000</published><title>Hydrophobic patches on SMAD2 and SMAD3 determine selective binding to cofactors</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1468?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1468?rss=1</link><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522345097000</published><author><name>Stains, M., Harshman, J., Barker, M.

Antimicrobial resistance against colistin has emerged worldwide threatening the efficacy of one of the last-resort antimicrobials used for the treatment of &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriacea&lt;/i&gt;e. To investigate the presence of the recently identified colistin resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt;) in China, we established PCRs to detect &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;5 on 213 anal and 1,339 nasal swabs from apparently healthy pigs (n = 1,454) in nine provinces, and 1,696 cloacal and 1,647 oropharyngeal samples from poultry (n = 1,836) at live-bird markets in 24 provinces of China. The prevalence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; in swine swabs (41.4%; 642/1,552) was significantly higher than in swabs from poultry (11.5%; 384/3,343). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; gene was found in geese (49.5%, 54/109), chickens (17.2%, 257/1,498), pigeons (17.2%, 17/99) and ducks (15.4%, 20/130). In a similar trend, the prevalence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; in swine swabs (33.1%; 514/1552) was significantly higher than in swabs from poultry (5.6%; 187/3,343). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; was identified in geese (17.4%, 19/109), chickens (9.9%, 148/1,498), ducks (7.7%, 10/130) and pigeons (3%, 3/99). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;4 prevalence in the nasal swabs from pigs (59.2%, 58/98) was significantly higher than that in anal swabs (29.6%, 29/98) (P&amp;lt;0.001). Similarly, the &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; prevalence in the nasal swabs from pigs (61.2%, 60/98) was significantly higher than in anal swabs (44.9%, 44/98) (P = 0.02), and significantly higher in oropharyngeal swabs (7.2%, 109/1,507) than in the cloacal swabs (3.7%, 56/1,507) (P&amp;lt;0.001). This study further confirms the presence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; in animals and indicates these genes are prevalent and widespread in food producing animals (pig and poultry) in China.

The annual return of beluga whales, &lt;i&gt;Delphinapterus leucas&lt;/i&gt;, to traditional seasonal locations across the Arctic may involve migratory culture, while the convergence of discrete summering aggregations on common wintering grounds may facilitate outbreeding. Natal philopatry and cultural inheritance, however, has been difficult to assess as earlier studies were of too short a duration, while genetic analyses of breeding patterns, especially across the beluga’s Pacific range, have been hampered by inadequate sampling and sparse information on wintering areas. Using a much expanded sample and genetic marker set comprising 1,647 whales, spanning more than two decades and encompassing all major coastal summering aggregations in the Pacific Ocean, we found evolutionary-level divergence among three geographic regions: the Gulf of Alaska, the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas, and the Sea of Okhotsk (&lt;i&gt;Φ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.11–0.32, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.09–0.13), and likely demographic independence of (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-mtDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.02–0.66), and in many cases limited gene flow (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-nDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0–0.02; &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; = 5–6) among, summering groups within regions. Assignment tests identified few immigrants within summering aggregations, linked migrating groups to specific summering areas, and found that some migratory corridors comprise whales from multiple subpopulations (P&lt;sub&gt;BAYES&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.31:0.69). Further, dispersal is male-biased and substantial numbers of closely related whales congregate together at coastal summering areas. Stable patterns of heterogeneity between areas and consistently high proportions (~20%) of close kin (including parent-offspring) sampled up to 20 years apart within areas (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt; = 0.2–2.9, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.5) is the first direct evidence of natal philopatry to migration destinations in belugas. Using recent satellite telemetry findings on belugas we found that the spatial proximity of winter ranges has a greater influence on the degree of both individual and genetic exchange than summer ranges (r&lt;sub&gt;winter&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-mtDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9, r&lt;sub&gt;summer&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-nDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1). These findings indicate widespread natal philopatry to summering aggregation and entire migratory circuits, and provide compelling evidence that migratory culture and kinship helps maintain demographically discrete beluga stocks that can overlap in time and space.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Greg O’Corry-Crowe</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123913:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>3598308a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Greg O’Corry-Crowe, Robert Suydam, Lori Quakenbush, Brooke Potgieter, Lois Harwood, Dennis Litovka, Tatiana Ferrer, John Citta, Vladimir Burkanov, Kathy Frost, Barbara Mahoney&lt;/p&gt;

These findings indicate widespread natal philopatry to summering aggregation and entire migratory circuits, and provide compelling evidence that migratory culture and kinship helps maintain demographically discrete beluga stocks that can overlap in time and space.</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Migratory culture, population structure and stock identity in North Pacific beluga whales &amp;lt;i&gt;(Delphinapterus leucas)&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.43</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.43</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/z0mv5-Q_OCk/nrd.2018.43</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market watch: Upcoming market catalysts in Q2 2018&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market watch: Upcoming market catalysts in Q2 2018, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.43&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Market watch: Upcoming market catalysts in Q2 2018&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/z0mv5-Q_OCk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>300</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>200</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nrd.2018.43-i1.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Alexandra Heller</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.43</link><id>YLwIhSxZAzQIEnJq1FGGcXUQMCbQUlr9cyNMExMVeyY=_1626b359a97:669eb43:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522217097879</crawled><fingerprint>f5aa1ff2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market watch: Upcoming market catalysts in Q2 2018&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market watch: Upcoming market catalysts in Q2 2018, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.43&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Market watch: Upcoming market catalysts in Q2 2018&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/z0mv5-Q_OCk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1522220400000</published><title>Market watch: Upcoming market catalysts in Q2 2018</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32332</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32332</link><crawled>1521637025388</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521590400000</published><author><name>huttner@mpi-cbg.de (Anneline Pinson)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32332</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16248a2666c:3654e09:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32332</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>2f1a578</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><description>Understanding the molecular basis that underlies the expansion of the neocortex during primate, and notably human, evolution requires the identification of genes that are particularly active in the neural stem and progenitor cells of the developing neocortex.

Endothelial dysfunction is one of the main pathological changes in Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway is associated with endothelial dysfunction. However, the interaction between ROCK and nuclear factor of activated T cells isoform c3 (NFATc3) in the development of this pathological response under chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is unclear. To simulate the OSA model, we established a moderate CIH rat model by administering the fraction of inspired O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from 21% to 9%, 20 times/h, 8 h/day for 3 weeks. Fasudil (ROCK inhibitor, 8 mg/kg/d, i.p.) was administrated in the rats exposed to CIH for 3 weeks. Our results demonstrated that CIH caused significantly endothelial dysfunction, accompanying with increased ET-1 level, decreased eNOS expression and NO production, which reduced ACh-induced vascular relaxation responses. Moreover, RhoA/ROCK-2/NFATc3 expressions were up-regulated. Fasudil significantly improved CIH induced endothelial dysfunction.

The subterranean niche harbours animals with extreme adaptations. These adaptations decrease the vagility of taxa and, along with other behavioural adaptations, often result in isolated populations characterized by small effective population sizes, high inbreeding, population bottlenecks, genetic drift and consequently, high spatial genetic structure. Although information is available for some species, estimates of genetic diversity and whether this variation is spatially structured, is lacking for the Cape mole-rat (&lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&lt;/i&gt;). By adopting a range-wide sampling regime and employing two variable mitochondrial markers (cytochrome &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; and control region), we report on the effects that life-history, population demography and geographic barriers had in shaping genetic variation and population genetic patterns in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt;. We also compare our results to information available for the sister taxon of the study species, &lt;i&gt;Bathyergus suillus&lt;/i&gt;. Our results show that &lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&lt;/i&gt; exhibits low genetic diversity relative to the concomitantly distributed &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;suillus&lt;/i&gt;, most likely due to differences in habitat specificity, habitat fragmentation and historical population declines. In addition, the isolated nature of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; populations and low levels of population connectivity has led to small effective population sizes and genetic differentiation, possibly aided by genetic drift. Not surprisingly therefore, &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; exhibits pronounced spatial structure across its range in South Africa.

The subterranean niche harbours animals with extreme adaptations. These adaptations decrease the vagility of taxa and, along with other behavioural adaptations, often result in isolated populations characterized by small effective population sizes, high inbreeding, population bottlenecks, genetic drift and consequently, high spatial genetic structure. Although information is available for some species, estimates of genetic diversity and whether this variation is spatially structured, is lacking for the Cape mole-rat (&lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&lt;/i&gt;). By adopting a range-wide sampling regime and employing two variable mitochondrial markers (cytochrome &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; and control region), we report on the effects that life-history, population demography and geographic barriers had in shaping genetic variation and population genetic patterns in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt;. We also compare our results to information available for the sister taxon of the study species, &lt;i&gt;Bathyergus suillus&lt;/i&gt;. Our results show that &lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&lt;/i&gt; exhibits low genetic diversity relative to the concomitantly distributed &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;suillus&lt;/i&gt;, most likely due to differences in habitat specificity, habitat fragmentation and historical population declines. In addition, the isolated nature of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; populations and low levels of population connectivity has led to small effective population sizes and genetic differentiation, possibly aided by genetic drift. Not surprisingly therefore, &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; exhibits pronounced spatial structure across its range in South Africa. Along with geographic distance and demography, other factors shaping the genetic structure of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; include the historical and contemporary impacts of mountains, rivers, sea-level fluctuations and elevation. Given the isolation and differentiation among &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; populations, the monotypic genus &lt;i&gt;Georychus&lt;/i&gt; may represent a species complex.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Spatial genetic diversity in the Cape mole-rat, &amp;lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&amp;lt;/i&gt;: Extreme isolation of populations in a subterranean environment</title></item><item><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/521/eaat5334?rss=1</originId><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/521/eaat5334?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/521/eaat5334?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;The histone demethylases LSD1 and JMJD2C enable premalignant melanocytes to escape oncogene-induced senescence and form aggressive melanomas.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><published>1520963427000</published><author><name>Ferrarelli, L.

The catastrophic misinterpretation model of panic disorder (PD) predicts that the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations is a distinctive characteristic of PD. Existing research on this prediction has produced mixed findings. This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the strength of catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations and external events in patients with PD, patients with other anxiety disorders, and healthy controls. Following a systematic screening, seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. For the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations, analyses showed medium to large effects between patients with PD and healthy controls and between patients with PD and patients with other anxiety disorders. For the catastrophic misinterpretation of external events, analyses showed medium to large effects between patients with PD and healthy controls and a small negative effect between patients with PD and patients with other anxiety disorders. The findings support the assumption that the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations is a distinctive characteristic of panic disorder and thus lend support to the catastrophic misinterpretation model of PD.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Barnabas Ohst</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194493</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37ac:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>3a161bdd</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Barnabas Ohst, Brunna Tuschen-Caffier&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Acute gastroenteritis illness is a common illness that causes considerable morbidity, but current estimates of the cost to the Australian healthcare system are unknown.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the current healthcare utilisation and direct public healthcare system costs attributable to acute gastroenteritis illness in Australia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is an incidence-based cost-of-illness study focused on quantifying direct health care costs using a bottom-up approach. Data on general practitioner consultations, prescribed medications, diagnostic tests, specialist consultations, emergency department visits and hospital admissions were collected from national reports.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using 2016 prices, the estimated annual direct per capita cost of acute gastroenteritis illness was AUD$14.87 (USD$10.71), equating to AUD$20.27 (USD$14.59) per case. The estimated overall economic burden in Australia was AUD$359 million (USD$258 million; AUD$1.5 million per 100,000 people). The major contributors to this cost were hospital admissions (57.1%), emergency department visits (17.7%), and general practitioner consultations (14.0%). Children under five years of age have the highest per capita rates of acute gastroenteritis illness; however, service utilisation rates vary by age group and both young children and older adults accounted for a substantial proportion of the overall economic burden attributable to acute gastroenteritis illness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although chronic diseases comprise a large cost burden on the healthcare system, acute illnesses, including acute gastroenteritis illness, also impose substantial direct healthcare system costs.

Managing landscape connectivity is a widely recognized overarching strategy for conserving biodiversity in human-impacted landscapes. However, planning the conservation and management of landscape connectivity of multiple and ecologically distinct species is still challenging. Here we provide a spatially-explicit framework which identifies and prioritizes connectivity conservation and restoration actions for species with distinct habitat affinities. Specifically, our study system comprised three groups of common bird species, forest-specialists, farmland-specialists, and generalists, populating a highly heterogeneous agricultural countryside in the southwestern Iberian Peninsula. We first performed a comprehensive analysis of the environmental variables underlying the distributional patterns of each bird species to reveal generalities in their guild-specific responses to landscape structure. Then, we identified sites which could be considered pivotal in maintaining current levels of landscape connectivity for the three bird guilds simultaneously, as well as the number and location of sites that need to be restored to maximize connectivity levels. Interestingly, we found that a small number of sites defined the shortest connectivity paths for the three bird guilds simultaneously, and were therefore considered key for conservation. Moreover, an even smaller number of sites were identified as critical to expand the landscape connectivity at maximum for the regional bird assemblage as a whole. Our spatially-explicit framework can provide valuable decision-making support to conservation practitioners aiming to identify key connectivity and restoration sites, a particularly urgent task in rapidly changing landscapes such as agroecosystems.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>José M.

In applications of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in clinical psychiatry settings in Japan, a phonemic verbal fluency test (VFT) that includes “switching” (the ability to shift efficiently to a new word subcategory) to assess phonemic fluency is employed to capture disease-specific hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study, to extend the specific features of this test, the VFT was repeated to examine an activation change in NIRS measurements in 20 healthy males. Without task performance change, the hemodynamic activation induced by the VFT was significantly attenuated in the left PFC through repetition of the task. These findings suggest that the left PFC is involved in processing of the VFT. Further, it may be possible to extend the current VFT using this repetition to provide a more sensitive examination of the left PFC, whose dysfunction has been reported in several psychiatric diseases such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Yoshihiro Kawakubo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193994</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087dd:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><fingerprint>e56ec173</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoshihiro Kawakubo, Masaya Yanagi, Noa Tsujii, Osamu Shirakawa&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 dibetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is frequent and associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard to measure cardiac autonomic neuropathy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta–analysis to evaluate the impact of T2DM on HRV parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; October 2017 using the keywords “diabetes” AND (“heart rate variability” OR “HRV”). Included articles had to report HRV parameters in T2DM patients and healthy controls measured during 24 hours with a Holter–electrocardiogram. Measurements of HRV retieved were: RR–intervals (or Normal to Normal intervals—NN), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), percetange of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), total power, Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio, as per Task Force recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included twenty-five case-control studies with 2,932 patients: 1,356 with T2DM and 1,576 healthy controls. T2DM patients had significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) lower RR–intervals (effect size = –0.61; 95%CI –1.21 to –0.01), lower SDNN (–0.65; –0.83 to –0.47), lower RMSSD (–0.92; –1.37 to –0.47), lower pNN50 (–0.46; –0.84 to –0.09), lower total power (–1.52; –2.13 to –0.91), lower LF (–1.08; –1.46 to –0.69]), and lower HF (–0.79; –1.09 to –0.50). LF/HF did not differ between groups. Levels of blood glucose and HbA1c were associated with several HRV parameters, as well as Time from diagnosis of T2DM&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;T2DM was associated with an overall decrease in the HRV of T2DM patients.

A goal of genomics is to understand the relationships between biological processes. Pathways contribute to functional interplay within biological processes through complex but poorly understood interactions. However, limited functional references for global pathway relationships exist. Pathways from databases such as KEGG and Reactome provide discrete annotations of biological processes. Their relationships are currently either inferred from gene set enrichment within specific experiments, or by simple overlap, linking pathway annotations that have genes in common. Here, we provide a unifying interpretation of functional interaction between pathways by systematically quantifying coexpression between 1,330 canonical pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to establish the Pathway Coexpression Network (PCxN). We estimated the correlation between canonical pathways valid in a broad context using a curated collection of 3,207 microarrays from 72 normal human tissues. PCxN accounts for shared genes between annotations to estimate significant correlations between pathways with related functions rather than with similar annotations. We demonstrate that PCxN provides novel insight into mechanisms of complex diseases using an Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) case study. PCxN retrieved pathways significantly correlated with an expert curated AD gene list. These pathways have known associations with AD and were significantly enriched for genes independently associated with AD. As a further step, we show how PCxN complements the results of gene set enrichment methods by revealing relationships between enriched pathways, and by identifying additional highly correlated pathways. PCxN revealed that correlated pathways from an AD expression profiling study include functional clusters involved in cell adhesion and oxidative stress. PCxN provides expanded connections to pathways from the extracellular matrix. PCxN provides a powerful new framework for interrogation of global pathway relationships. Comprehensive exploration of PCxN can be performed at http://pcxn.org/.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C39wpIQO--A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006042</href></item></canonical><engagement>144</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006042</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1623f563f80:158030a:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521481039744</crawled><fingerprint>9ad047b9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yered Pita-Juárez, Gabriel Altschuler, Sokratis Kariotis, Wenbin Wei, Katjuša Koler, Claire Green, Rudolph E.

The present study evaluated auditory sensitivity to spectral modulation by determining the modulation depth required to detect modulation phase reversal. This approach may be preferable to spectral modulation detection with a spectrally flat standard, since listeners appear unable to perform the task based on the detection of temporal modulation. While phase reversal thresholds are often evaluated by holding modulation depth constant and adjusting modulation rate, holding rate constant and adjusting modulation depth supports rate-specific assessment of modulation processing. Stimuli were pink noise samples, filtered into seven octave-wide bands (0.125–8 kHz) and spectrally modulated in dB. Experiment 1 measured performance as a function of modulation depth to determine appropriate units for adaptive threshold estimation. Experiment 2 compared thresholds in dB for modulation detection with a flat standard and modulation phase reversal; results supported the idea that temporal cues were available at high rates for the former but not the latter. Experiment 3 evaluated spectral modulation phase reversal thresholds for modulation that was restricted to either one or two neighboring bands. Flanking bands of unmodulated noise had a larger detrimental effect on one-band than two-band targets. Thresholds for high-rate modulation improved with increasing carrier frequency up to 2 kHz, whereas low-rate modulation appeared more consistent across frequency, particularly in the two-band condition. Experiment 4 measured spectral weights for spectral modulation phase reversal detection and found higher weights for bands in the spectral center of the stimulus than for the lowest (0.125 kHz) or highest (8 kHz) band. Experiment 5 compared performance for highly practiced and relatively naïve listeners, and found weak evidence of a larger practice effect at high than low spectral modulation rates. These results provide preliminary data for a task that may provide a better estimate of sensitivity to spectral modulation than spectral modulation detection with a flat standard.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Emily Buss</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195686</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d74d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>6e45d9a8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emily Buss, John Grose&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Evidence remains limited on why diabetes and hypertensive patients admitted to long-term drug therapy miss doses or discontinue medication taking. We examined this phenomenon from the perspective of diabetes and hypertension patients at a Ghanaian teaching hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between July and December 2015, we conducted a qualitative study targeting caregivers and their patients with chronic diabetes and hypertensive on re-admission at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital due to non-adherence to prescribed medication. Participants were sampled purposefully and taking through in-depth interviews using an interview guide. Notes and audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, managed and coded for themes guided by the thematic network analysis recommended by Attride-Stirling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Non-adherence was the result of perceptions that the medications are not effective for managing the conditions. Patients with these perceptions rejected the medications and turned to herbal medicines and spiritual healing as therapeutic alternatives, because of their easy accessibility, perceived efficacy and affordability. Other factors identified to influence non-adherence included polypharmacy practice; tight work schedules; social norms; poor prescription instruction by health providers; and knowledge and experience of medication.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Findings suggests the need for health providers to adopt therapeutic approaches that take into account patients’ beliefs, values and norms in administering medications. Sensitisation of patients and caregivers during admission on the implication of non-adherence, as well as interventions that monitor and provide feedback mechanisms on patients’ medication taking behaviour holds promise for maximising diabetes and hypertensive medication adherence.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Roger A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Spreadsheet software is increasingly used to implement systems science models informing health policy decisions, both in academia and in practice where technical capacity may be limited. However, spreadsheet models are prone to unintentional errors that may not always be identified using standard error-checking techniques. Our objective was to illustrate, through a methodologic case study analysis, the impact of unintentional errors on model projections by implementing parallel model versions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We leveraged a real-world need to revise an existing spreadsheet model designed to inform HIV policy. We developed three parallel versions of a previously validated spreadsheet-based model; versions differed by the spreadsheet cell-referencing approach (named single cells; column/row references; named matrices). For each version, we implemented three model revisions (re-entry into care; guideline-concordant treatment initiation; immediate treatment initiation). After standard error-checking, we identified unintentional errors by comparing model output across the three versions. Concordant model output across all versions was considered error-free. We calculated the impact of unintentional errors as the percentage difference in model projections between model versions with and without unintentional errors, using +/-5% difference to define a material error.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified 58 original and 4,331 propagated unintentional errors across all model versions and revisions. Over 40% (24/58) of original unintentional errors occurred in the column/row reference model version; most (23/24) were due to incorrect cell references. Overall, &gt;20% of model spreadsheet cells had material unintentional errors. When examining error impact along the HIV care continuum, the percentage difference between versions with and without unintentional errors ranged from +3% to +16% (named single cells), +26% to +76% (column/row reference), and 0% (named matrices).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Standard error-checking techniques may not identify all errors in spreadsheet-based models. Comparing parallel model versions can aid in identifying unintentional errors and promoting reliable model projections, particularly when resources are limited.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Stephanie L.

Performance-based financing (PBF) schemes have been expanding rapidly across low and middle income countries in the past decade, with considerable external financing from multilateral, bilateral and global health initiatives. Many of these countries have been fragile and conflict-affected (FCAS), but while the influence of context is acknowledged to be important to the operation of PBF, there has been little examination of how it affects adoption and implementation of PBF. This article lays out initial hypotheses about how FCAS contexts may influence the adoption, adaption, implementation and health system effects of PBF. These are then interrogated through a review of available grey and published literature (140 documents in total, covering 23 PBF schemes). We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Maria Paola Bertone</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195301</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f62:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>47fe2690</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Paola Bertone, Jean-Benoît Falisse, Giuliano Russo, Sophie Witter&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Polypharmacy is common among older adults. However, little is known about the composition of polypharmacy: which are the most frequently used drugs, and how much do these drugs contribute to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 822,619 Swedes aged ≥75 years was identified from the Total Population Register.

The most frequently used drugs were cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, and psychotropics. By excluding the ten most frequently used drug classes or compounds, the prevalence of polypharmacy was reduced by 69% and 51% respectively. The majority of the users of either one of the 10 most frequently used drugs concurrently used at least 4 other drug classes (66%-85%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Almost half of the individuals aged ≥75 years are exposed to polypharmacy in Sweden. A handful of drugs make a large contribution to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy and the majority of drugs prescribed to persons aged ≥75 years are used in combination with other drugs.

&lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt; is an emerging yeast pathogen of global significance. Its multidrug-resistant nature and inadequacies of conventional identification systems pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This study investigated occurrence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; in clinical specimens in Kuwait and its susceptibility to antifungal agents. Clinical yeast strains isolated during 3.5-year period and forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida were studied by wet mount examination for microscopic morphology and Vitek 2 yeast identification system. A simple species-specific PCR assay was developed for molecular identification and results were confirmed by PCR-sequencing of rDNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing of one isolate from each patient was determined by Etest. The 280 isolates forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida, were identified by Vitek 2 as &lt;i&gt;Candida haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 166), &lt;i&gt;Candida utilis&lt;/i&gt; (n = 49), &lt;i&gt;Candida kefyr&lt;/i&gt; (n = 45), &lt;i&gt;Candida guilliermondii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 9), &lt;i&gt;Candida famata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) and &lt;i&gt;Candida conglobata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 5). Species-specific PCR and PCR-sequencing of rDNA identified 166 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; isolates as &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; (n = 158), &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) and &lt;i&gt;Candida duobushaemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 2). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; isolates originated from diverse clinical specimens from 56 patients. Of 56 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested, all were resistant to fluconazole, 41/56 (73%) and 13/56 (23%) were additionally resistant to voriconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. Eleven (20%) isolates were resistant to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. One isolate was resistant to caspofungin and micafungin. Increasing isolation of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; in recent years from diverse clinical specimens including bloodstream shows that &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; is an emerging non-&lt;i&gt;albicans Candida&lt;/i&gt; species in Kuwait causing a variety of infections. Inability of conventional identification methods to accurately identify this pathogen and multidrug-resistant nature of many strains calls for a greater understanding of its epidemiology, risk factors for acquiring &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; infection and management strategies in high-risk patients.

The peregrine falcon &lt;i&gt;Falco peregrinus&lt;/i&gt; is renowned for attacking its prey from high altitude in a fast controlled dive called a stoop. Many other raptors employ a similar mode of attack, but the functional benefits of stooping remain obscure. Here we investigate whether, when, and why stooping promotes catch success, using a three-dimensional, agent-based modeling approach to simulate attacks of falcons on aerial prey. We simulate avian flapping and gliding flight using an analytical quasi-steady model of the aerodynamic forces and moments, parametrized by empirical measurements of flight morphology. The model-birds’ flight control inputs are commanded by their guidance system, comprising a phenomenological model of its vision, guidance, and control. To intercept its prey, model-falcons use the same guidance law as missiles (pure proportional navigation); this assumption is corroborated by empirical data on peregrine falcons hunting lures. We parametrically vary the falcon’s starting position relative to its prey, together with the feedback gain of its guidance loop, under differing assumptions regarding its errors and delay in vision and control, and for three different patterns of prey motion. We find that, when the prey maneuvers erratically, high-altitude stoops increase catch success compared to low-altitude attacks, but only if the falcon’s guidance law is appropriately tuned, and only given a high degree of precision in vision and control. Remarkably, the optimal tuning of the guidance law in our simulations coincides closely with what has been observed empirically in peregrines. High-altitude stoops are shown to be beneficial because their high airspeed enables production of higher aerodynamic forces for maneuvering, and facilitates higher roll agility as the wings are tucked, each of which is essential to catching maneuvering prey at realistic response delays.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ypEvewr7kSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006044</href></item></canonical><engagement>15</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006044</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162baf3e3ad:bf9d1f:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523554968493</crawled><fingerprint>234a5718</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagementRate>15.0</engagementRate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robin Mills, Hanno Hildenbrandt, Graham K.

This national online cross-sectional survey in Italy assessed primary care pediatricians’ (PCPs) attitudes and practices regarding Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and the contribution of several characteristics. The questionnaire was distributed from September 2016 to June 2017 to a random sample of 640 PCPs by email via an internet-link leading to a web-based survey platform (Lime Survey). Only 18.4% of PCPs always recommend the HPV vaccine to 11–12 year old boys. PCPs with longer practice activity, working in solo practice, always recommended the HPV vaccine to 11–12 year old girls, and believed that the vaccine was effective for boys were more likely to always recommend the HPV vaccine. PCPs working in a Region where the vaccination was actively recommended and provided free of charge to 11–12 year old boys had higher odds of recommending vaccination. More than two thirds of PCPs (77.4%) always recommend the HPV vaccine to 11–12 year old girls. PCPs who believed that the vaccine was effective for girls and safe in both boys and girls, who always talk with patients of 11–18 years or their parents about HPV infection and vaccination, and who obtain vaccine information from scientific journals were more likely to always recommend the vaccine. PCPs should employ evidence-based educational strategies in order to achieve a better coverage and to reduce the morbidities and mortality of diseases associated with HPV.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Francesco Napolitano</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194920</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef09:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>ee3168a7</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Napolitano, Monica Navaro, Luigi Vezzosi, Gabriella Santagati, Italo Francesco Angelillo&lt;/p&gt;

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) causes progressive disability in 1 of every 5,000 boys due to the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Despite much advancement in knowledge about DMD disease presentation and progression—attributable in part to studies using mouse and canine models of the disease–current DMD treatments are not equally effective in all patients. There remains, therefore, a need for translational animal models in which novel treatment targets can be identified and evaluated. Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a phenotypically and genetically homologous animal model of DMD. As with DMD, speed of disease progression in GRMD varies substantially. However, unlike DMD, all GRMD dogs possess the same causal mutation; therefore genetic modifiers of phenotypic variation are relatively easier to identify. Furthermore, the GRMD dogs used in this study reside within the same colony, reducing the confounding effects of environment on phenotypic variation. To detect modifiers of disease progression, we developed gene expression profiles using RNA sequencing for 9 dogs: 6 GRMD dogs (3 with faster-progressing and 3 with slower-progressing disease, based on quantitative, objective biomarkers) and 3 control dogs from the same colony. All dogs were evaluated at 2 time points: early disease onset (3 months of age) and the point at which GRMD stabilizes (6 months of age) using quantitative, objective biomarkers identified as robust against the effects of relatedness/inbreeding. Across all comparisons, the most differentially expressed genes fell into 3 categories: myogenesis/muscle regeneration, metabolism, and inflammation. Our findings are largely in concordance with DMD and mouse model studies, reinforcing the utility of GRMD as a translational model. Novel findings include the strong up-regulation of chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) in faster-progressing GRMD dogs, suggesting previously unexplored mechanisms underlie progression speed in GRMD and DMD. In summary, our findings support the utility of RNA sequencing for evaluating potential biomarkers of GRMD progression speed, and are valuable for identifying new avenues of exploration in DMD research.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fd:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>816dcdf7</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford, Candice Chu, Cynthia Balog-Alvarez, Xue Yu, James J.

The existing protein complex detection methods can be broadly divided into two categories: unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Most of the unsupervised learning methods assume that protein complexes are in dense regions of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks even though many true complexes are not dense subgraphs. Supervised learning methods utilize the informative properties of known complexes; they often extract features from existing complexes and then use the features to train a classification model. The trained model is used to guide the search process for new complexes. However, insufficient extracted features, noise in the PPI data and the incompleteness of complex data make the classification model imprecise. Consequently, the classification model is not sufficient for guiding the detection of complexes. Therefore, we propose a new robust score function that combines the classification model with local structural information. Based on the score function, we provide a search method that works both forwards and backwards. The results from experiments on six benchmark PPI datasets and three protein complex datasets show that our approach can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods for protein complex detection, occasionally significantly outperforming such methods.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Yadong Dong</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194124</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88ef:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>608c2992</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yadong Dong, Yongqi Sun, Chao Qin&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Aluminum phosphide (AlP) is used as pesticide in some countries for protection of stored grains. Human poisoning with AlP due to suicide attempt or accidental environmental exposure is associated with very high mortality partially due to development of severe metabolic acidosis. Previous studies have shown that hemoglobin has high buffering capacity and erythrocytes can potentially be used for management of metabolic acidosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fresh packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion on survival and cardiovascular function in AlP-poisoned rats.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Rats were poisoned with AlP by gavage. Fresh packed RBC was transfused via tail vein after AlP administration. Acid-base balance, vital signs and mortality was assessed and compared in experimental groups. Infusion of fresh packed RBC (1.5 ml) one hour after AlP (4–15 mg/kg) intoxication was associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate. Packed RBC infusion improved blood pH, HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels.

Recent vaccine studies with experimental antigens have shown that regulatory T cells (Tregs) constrain the magnitude of B cell responses. This homeostatic Treg-mediated suppression is thought to reduce the potential of germinal center (GC) responses to generate autoreactive antibodies. However, essentially opposite results were observed in live influenza infections where Tregs promoted B cell and antibody responses. Thus, it remains unclear whether Tregs dampen or enhance B cell responses, especially during live viral infections. Here, we use mice infected with Friend retrovirus (FV), which induces a robust expansion of Tregs. Depletion of Tregs led to elevated activation, proliferation, and class switching of B cells. In addition, Treg depletion enhanced the production of virus-specific and virus-neutralizing antibodies and reduced FV viremia. Thus, in contrast to influenza infection, Tregs either directly or indirectly suppress B cells during mouse retroviral infection indicating that the ultimate effect of Tregs on B cell responses is specific to the particular infectious agent.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Tyler C.

Here, we use mice infected with Friend retrovirus (FV), which induces a robust expansion of Tregs. Depletion of Tregs led to elevated activation, proliferation, and class switching of B cells. In addition, Treg depletion enhanced the production of virus-specific and virus-neutralizing antibodies and reduced FV viremia. Thus, in contrast to influenza infection, Tregs either directly or indirectly suppress B cells during mouse retroviral infection indicating that the ultimate effect of Tregs on B cell responses is specific to the particular infectious agent.</description><published>1522789200000</published><title>Regulatory T cells suppress virus-specific antibody responses to Friend retrovirus infection</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195167</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195167</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195167</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer E.

Tristan da Cunha Islands, an archipelago of four rocky volcanic islands situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and part of the United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), present a rare example of a relatively unimpacted temperate marine ecosystem. We conducted the first quantitative surveys of nearshore kelp forests, offshore pelagic waters and deep sea habitats. Kelp forests had very low biodiversity and species richness, but high biomass and abundance of those species present. Spatial variation in assemblage structure for both nearshore fish and invertebrates/algae was greatest between the three northern islands and the southern island of Gough, where sea temperatures were on average 3-4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; colder. Despite a lobster fishery that provides the bulk of the income to the Tristan islands, lobster abundance and biomass are comparable to or greater than many Marine Protected Areas in other parts of the world. Pelagic camera surveys documented a rich biodiversity offshore, including large numbers of juvenile blue sharks, &lt;i&gt;Prionace glauca&lt;/i&gt;. Species richness and abundance in the deep sea is positively related to hard rocky substrate and biogenic habitats such as sea pens, crinoids, whip corals, and gorgonians were present at 40% of the deep camera deployments. We observed distinct differences in the deep fish community above and below ~750 m depth. Concurrent oceanographic sampling showed a discontinuity in temperature and salinity at this depth. While currently healthy, Tristan’s marine ecosystem is not without potential threats: shipping traffic leading to wrecks and species introductions, pressure to increase fishing effort beyond sustainable levels and the impacts of climate change all could potentially increase in the coming years. The United Kingdom has committed to protection of marine environments across the UKOTs, including Tristan da Cunha and these results can be used to inform future management decisions as well as provide a baseline against which future monitoring can be based.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Jennifer E.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where burden, impact, and incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the highest in the world, conversely, the epidemiology of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) is incompletely known. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of influenza-associated SARI in hospitalized children in Maputo city, Mozambique. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children aged 0–14 years old who met the case definition for SARI in two hospitals in Maputo city after their parents or legal representative consented to participate. A structured questionnaire was used to collect clinical and demographic data. Typing and subtyping of influenza were performed by real-time PCR. From January 2014 to December 2016, a total of 2,007 eligible children were recruited, of whom 1,997 (99.5%) were screened for influenza by real-time PCR. The median age of participants was 16.9 months (IQR: 7.0–38.9 months) and 53.9% (1076/1991) were male. A total of 77 were positive for influenza, yielding a frequency of 3.9% (77/1,991), with the highest frequency being reported in the age group 1–5 years old. Cases of influenza peaked twice each year, during which, its frequency reached up to 60%-80%. Among all influenza confirmed cases, 33.7% (26/77), 35.1% (27/77) and 28.6% (22/77) were typed as influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and B, respectively. This represents the first report of influenza in urban/sub urban setting in Mozambique and the first evidence of distribution of strains of influenza in the country. Our data showed that frequency of influenza was lower than reported in a rural setting in Mozambique and the frequency of seasonal (A/H1N1pdm09) and (A/H3N2) subtypes were similar in children with SARI.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Neuza Nguenha</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194138</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2813:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>abf3927</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Neuza Nguenha, Almiro Tivane, Mirela Pale, Loira Machalele, Afonso Nacoto, Germano Pires, Edirsse Mationane, Judite Salência, Félix Gundane, Délcio Muteto, Josina Chilundo, Sandra Mavale, Noorbebi Adamo, Cynthia Semá-Baltazar, Orvalho Augusto, Eduardo Gudo, Tufária Mussá&lt;/p&gt;

The precursor ribosomal RNA is processed by multiple steps of nucleolytic cleavage to generate mature rRNAs. Utp24 is a PIN domain endonuclease in the early 90S precursor of small ribosomal subunit and is proposed to cleave at sites A1 and A2 of pre-rRNA. Here we determine the crystal structure of Utp24 from &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt; at 2.1 angstrom resolution. Utp24 structurally resembles the ribosome assembly factor Utp23 and both contain a Zn-finger motif. Functional analysis in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; shows that depletion of Utp24 disturbs the assembly of 90S and abolishes cleavage at sites A0, A1 and A2.

The precursor ribosomal RNA is processed by multiple steps of nucleolytic cleavage to generate mature rRNAs. Utp24 is a PIN domain endonuclease in the early 90S precursor of small ribosomal subunit and is proposed to cleave at sites A1 and A2 of pre-rRNA. Here we determine the crystal structure of Utp24 from &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt; at 2.1 angstrom resolution. Utp24 structurally resembles the ribosome assembly factor Utp23 and both contain a Zn-finger motif. Functional analysis in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; shows that depletion of Utp24 disturbs the assembly of 90S and abolishes cleavage at sites A0, A1 and A2. The 90S assembled with inactivated Utp24 is arrested at a post-A0-cleavage state and contains enriched nuclear exosome for degradation of 5&apos; ETS. Despite of high sequence conservation, Utp24 from other organisms is unable to form an active 90S in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that Utp24 needs to be precisely positioned in 90S. Our study provides biochemical and structural insight into the role of Utp24 in 90S assembly and activity.</description><engagementRate>1.0</engagementRate><published>1523480400000</published><title>Structural and functional analysis of Utp24, an endonuclease for processing 18S ribosomal RNA</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300996v1?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300996v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300996v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The topological landscape of gene interaction networks provides a rich source of information for inferring functional patterns of genes or proteins.
