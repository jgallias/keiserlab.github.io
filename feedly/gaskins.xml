&lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; HP0377 is a thiol oxidoreductase, a member of the CcmG family involved in cytochrome biogenesis, as previously shown by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments. In this report, we document that HP0377 also acts &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in the cytochrome assembly process in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, where it complements the lack of ResA. However, unlike other characterized proteins in this family, HP0377 is a dithiol reductase and isomerase. We elucidated how the amino acid composition of its active site modulates its functionality. We demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-proline (P156) is involved in its interaction with the redox partner (CcdA), as a P156T HP0377 variant is inactive &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and is present in the oxidized form in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, we showed that engineering the HP0377 active motif by changing CSYC motif into CSYS or SSYC, clearly diminishes two activities (reduction and isomerization) of the protein. Whereas HP0377&lt;sub&gt;CSYA&lt;/sub&gt; is inactive in reduction as well as in isomerization, HP0377&lt;sub&gt;CSYS&lt;/sub&gt; retains reductive activity. Also, replacement of F95 by Q decreases its ability to regenerate scRNase and does not influence the reductive activity of HP0377&lt;sub&gt;CSYS&lt;/sub&gt; towards apocytochrome c. HP0377 is also distinguished from other CcmGs as it forms a 2:1 complex with apocytochrome c. Phylogenetic analyses showed that, although HP0377 is capable of complementing ResA in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, its thioredoxin domain has a different origin, presumably common to DsbC.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195358</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>62cd017b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Magdalena Joanna Grzeszczuk, Aleksandra Bąk, Anna Marta Banaś, Paweł Urbanowicz, Stanislaw Dunin-Horkawicz, Artur Gieldon, Cezary Czaplewski, Adam Liwo, Elżbieta K.

Terrestrial arthropods play an important role in saltmarsh ecosystems, mainly affecting the saltmarsh’s primary production as the main consumers of terrestrial primary production and decomposition. Some of these arthropods, including selected insects and spiders, can be used as ecological indicators of overall marsh environmental health, as they are differentially sensitive to ecological stressors, such as land loss, erosion, oil spills, and tropical storms. In the present study, we used terrestrial arthropods collected from seven (three lightly-oiled, four heavily-oiled) sites in Barataria Bay and from three unoiled reference sites in Delacroix, Louisiana, to determine the impacts of the distribution and re-distribution of &lt;i&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/i&gt; (DWH) oil on these saltmarsh ecosystems. A total of 9,476 and 12,256 insects were collected in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The results show that the terrestrial arthropods were negatively affected by the re-distribution of DWH oil by Hurricane Isaac in 2012, although the level of impacts varied among the arthropod groups.

Terrestrial arthropods play an important role in saltmarsh ecosystems, mainly affecting the saltmarsh’s primary production as the main consumers of terrestrial primary production and decomposition. Some of these arthropods, including selected insects and spiders, can be used as ecological indicators of overall marsh environmental health, as they are differentially sensitive to ecological stressors, such as land loss, erosion, oil spills, and tropical storms. In the present study, we used terrestrial arthropods collected from seven (three lightly-oiled, four heavily-oiled) sites in Barataria Bay and from three unoiled reference sites in Delacroix, Louisiana, to determine the impacts of the distribution and re-distribution of &lt;i&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/i&gt; (DWH) oil on these saltmarsh ecosystems. A total of 9,476 and 12,256 insects were collected in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The results show that the terrestrial arthropods were negatively affected by the re-distribution of DWH oil by Hurricane Isaac in 2012, although the level of impacts varied among the arthropod groups. Moreover, the mean diversity index was higher (&gt;1.5) in 2014 than in 2013 (&amp;lt;1.5) for all sites, suggesting a recovery trajectory of the saltmarsh arthropod population. The higher taxonomic richness observed in the reference sites compared to the oiled sites for both years also indicated long-term impacts of DWH oil to the saltmarsh arthropod community. Whereas a slow recovery of certain terrestrial arthropods was observed, long-term monitoring of arthropod communities would help better understand the recovery and succession of the marsh ecosystems.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194941</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Wokil Bam</name></author><title>Coupled effects of oil spill and hurricane on saltmarsh terrestrial arthropods</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523480400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd7f:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194941</link><published>1523480400000</published></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/162-b?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/162.2.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5525fd7e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/162-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Yammine, S.

The microtubule associated protein tau plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that tau also plays a role in disorders of neuronal connectivity, including epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. Animal studies have shown that the MAPT gene, which codes for the tau protein, undergoes complex pre-mRNA alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms during brain development. Human data, particularly on temporal and regional variation in tau splicing during development are however lacking. In this study, we present the first detailed examination of the temporal and regional sequence of MAPT alternative splicing in the developing human brain. We used a novel computational analysis of large transcriptomic datasets (total n = 502 patients), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting to examine tau expression and splicing in post-mortem human fetal, pediatric and adult brains. We found that MAPT exons 2 and 10 undergo abrupt shifts in expression during the perinatal period that are unique in the canonical human microtubule-associated protein family, while exon 3 showed small but significant temporal variation. Tau isoform expression may be a marker of neuronal maturation, temporally correlated with the onset of axonal growth.

The microtubule associated protein tau plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that tau also plays a role in disorders of neuronal connectivity, including epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. Animal studies have shown that the MAPT gene, which codes for the tau protein, undergoes complex pre-mRNA alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms during brain development. Human data, particularly on temporal and regional variation in tau splicing during development are however lacking. In this study, we present the first detailed examination of the temporal and regional sequence of MAPT alternative splicing in the developing human brain. We used a novel computational analysis of large transcriptomic datasets (total n = 502 patients), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting to examine tau expression and splicing in post-mortem human fetal, pediatric and adult brains. We found that MAPT exons 2 and 10 undergo abrupt shifts in expression during the perinatal period that are unique in the canonical human microtubule-associated protein family, while exon 3 showed small but significant temporal variation. Tau isoform expression may be a marker of neuronal maturation, temporally correlated with the onset of axonal growth. Immature brain regions such as the ganglionic eminence and rhombic lip had very low tau expression, but within more mature regions, there was little variation in tau expression or splicing. We thus demonstrate an abrupt, evolutionarily conserved shift in tau isoform expression during the human perinatal period that may be due to tau expression in maturing neurons. Alternative splicing of the &lt;i&gt;MAPT&lt;/i&gt; pre-mRNA may play a vital role in normal brain development across multiple species and provides a basis for future investigations into the developmental and pathological functions of the tau protein.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195771</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Marco M.

The ability to simultaneously process and maintain multiple pieces of information is limited. Over the past 50 years, observational methods have provided a large amount of insight regarding the neural mechanisms that underpin the mental capacity that we refer to as “working memory.” More than 20 years ago, a neural coding scheme was proposed for working memory. As a result of technological developments, we can now not only observe but can also influence brain rhythms in humans. Building on these novel developments, we have begun to externally control brain oscillations in order to extend the limits of working memory.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZK-DqGkj6Do&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zsolt Turi, Ivan Alekseichuk, Walter Paulus&lt;/p&gt;

In health sector, trust is considered important because it indirectly influences the quality of health care through patient satisfaction, adherence and the continuity of its relationship with health care professionals and the promotion of accurate and timely diagnoses. One of the important requirements of TRSs in the health sector is rating secrecy, which mandates that the identification information about the service consumer should be kept secret to prevent any privacy violation. Anonymity and trust are two imperative objectives, and no significant explicit efforts have been made to achieve both of them at the same time. In this paper, we present a framework for solving the problem of reconciling trust with anonymity in the health sector. Our solution comprises Anonymous &lt;i&gt;Reputation Management&lt;/i&gt; (ARM) protocol and &lt;i&gt;Context-aware Trustworthiness Assessment&lt;/i&gt; (CTA) protocol. ARM protocol ensures that only those service consumers who received a service from a specific service provider provide a recommendation score anonymously with in the specified time limit. The CTA protocol computes the reputation of a user as a service provider and as a recommender. To determine the correctness of the proposed ARM protocol, formal modelling and verification are performed using High Level Petri Nets (HLPN) and Z3 Solver. Our simulation results verify the accuracy of the proposed context-aware trust assessment scheme.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4913f262</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Farhana Jabeen, Zara Hamid, Wadood Abdul, Sanaa Ghouzali, Abid Khan, Saif Ur Rehman Malik, Mansoor Shaukat Khan, Sarfraz Nawaz&lt;/p&gt;

To ensure optimal calcium accrual in the fetal skeleton, a substantial rise occurs in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D), but is dependent on sufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D). Large longitudinal studies addressing free 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D during pregnancy are scarce. We aimed to assess levels of and relationship between 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and free 25(OH)D during pregnancy; determinants of vitamin D status; and association between vitamin D indices or PTH and pregnancy outcomes (gestational diabetes mellitus and birthweight). Altogether 855 pregnant Norwegian Caucasian women from Trondheim and Stavanger (latitude 63°N and 58°N) were recruited; 94 were lost to follow-up. The study was originally a randomized controlled trial (2007–2009) with gestational diabetes as primary outcome. Data were collected in second and third trimester. In third trimester, 246 (34%) had vitamin D insufficiency and 52 (7%) deficiency (25(OH)D &amp;lt;50 and &amp;lt;30nmol/L, respectively). During wintertime in third trimester, 61 (47%) from Trondheim and 23 (51%) from Stavanger exhibited vitamin D insufficiency. PTH was elevated in 27 (3.7%). Estimate of change between trimesters was (95% CI): 25(OH)D -1.8 (-2.8 to -0.7) nmol/L, DBP 0.62 (0.57 to 0.66) μmol/L, calculated free 25(OH)D -1.7 (-2.0 to -1.4) pmol/L, PTH 0.81 (0.72 to 0.90) pmol/L, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D (sub-analysis) 31.4 (CI 24.7 to 38.2) pmol/L. A decrease in 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D occurred in 45% of those with vitamin D deficiency, and they also exhibited lower levels than women with adequate vitamin D status. No association of vitamin D indices and PTH with pregnancy outcomes was observed. Women in Trondheim displayed lower 25(OH)D levels, despite minor latitudinal differences. Less than one-fifth adhered to the authorities’ vitamin D recommendations. These findings demonstrate that hypovitaminosis D is prevalent among pregnant women living in northern latitudes, especially during the dark season, and there is an unmet need to ensure adequate vitamin D intake.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195041</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3f1ae0fd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Miriam K.

Altogether 855 pregnant Norwegian Caucasian women from Trondheim and Stavanger (latitude 63°N and 58°N) were recruited; 94 were lost to follow-up. The study was originally a randomized controlled trial (2007–2009) with gestational diabetes as primary outcome. Data were collected in second and third trimester. In third trimester, 246 (34%) had vitamin D insufficiency and 52 (7%) deficiency (25(OH)D &amp;lt;50 and &amp;lt;30nmol/L, respectively). During wintertime in third trimester, 61 (47%) from Trondheim and 23 (51%) from Stavanger exhibited vitamin D insufficiency. PTH was elevated in 27 (3.7%). Estimate of change between trimesters was (95% CI): 25(OH)D -1.8 (-2.8 to -0.7) nmol/L, DBP 0.62 (0.57 to 0.66) μmol/L, calculated free 25(OH)D -1.7 (-2.0 to -1.4) pmol/L, PTH 0.81 (0.72 to 0.90) pmol/L, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D (sub-analysis) 31.4 (CI 24.7 to 38.2) pmol/L. A decrease in 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D occurred in 45% of those with vitamin D deficiency, and they also exhibited lower levels than women with adequate vitamin D status. No association of vitamin D indices and PTH with pregnancy outcomes was observed. Women in Trondheim displayed lower 25(OH)D levels, despite minor latitudinal differences. Less than one-fifth adhered to the authorities’ vitamin D recommendations. These findings demonstrate that hypovitaminosis D is prevalent among pregnant women living in northern latitudes, especially during the dark season, and there is an unmet need to ensure adequate vitamin D intake.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195041</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Miriam K.

The spatial architecture of signaling pathways and the interaction with cell size and morphology are complex, but little understood. With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology, it becomes crucial to understand intracellular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We suggest an estimate of average concentration for arbitrary cell shapes depending on the cell volume and cell surface area. The normalized variance, known from image analysis, is suggested as an alternative measure to quantify the deviation from the average concentration. A mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space is presented, providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. Quantification of signaling time scales reveals that signal propagation is faster at the membrane than at the nucleus, while this time difference decreases with the number of signaling components in the cytosol. Our investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades with feedback and asymmetric cell shapes. We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wolfgang Giese, Gregor Milicic, Andreas Schröder, Edda Klipp&lt;/p&gt;

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with inflammation. We tried to investigate the influence of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and tocilizumab (TCZ) on the glucose metabolism of RA patients. RA patients in whom treatment with TNFi or TCZ was initiated from 2008 to 2015 were studied based on their medical records. We analyzed patients whose glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured both before and 3 months after the initiation of these biologic agents. The association between HbA1c reduction and the treatment was evaluated. From 971 cases treated with these biologic agents, 221 cases whose medical records of HbA1c were available, were included (TNFi, n = 154; TCZ, n = 67). Both the TNFi and TCZ groups had significantly lower HbA1c values at 1 month and 3 months after the initiation of treatment (TNFi, p&amp;lt;0.001; TCZ, p&amp;lt;0.001). Although the pretreatment HbA1c values did not differ (TNFi, 6.2%; TCZ, 6.2%; p = 0.532), the 3-month treatment HbA1c values were lower (TNFi, 6.1%; TCZ, 5.8%; p = 0.010) and the changes in HbA1c (ΔHbA1c) were greater (TNFi, 0.1%; TCZ, 0.4%; p&amp;lt;0.001) in the TCZ group. The reduction of HbA1c—defined by the achievement of a ΔHbA1c of ≥0.5%—was associated with baseline diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, baseline diabetes treatment, hospitalization, medical change during the observation period, and TCZ. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, TCZ was associated with the reduction of HbA1c in comparison to TNFi (adjusted OR = 5.59, 95% CI = 2.56–12.2; p&amp;lt;0.001). The HbA1c levels in RA patients were significantly lower after the initiation of TNFi or TCZ. Our study suggests that TCZ decreases the HbA1c levels in RA patients to a greater extent than TNFi.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196368</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>657a43f0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yukimi Otsuka, Chikako Kiyohara, Yusuke Kashiwado, Takuya Sawabe, Shuji Nagano, Yasutaka Kimoto, Masahiro Ayano, Hiroki Mitoma, Mitsuteru Akahoshi, Yojiro Arinobu, Hiroaki Niiro, Koichi Akashi, Takahiko Horiuchi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium&lt;/i&gt; plays a significant role in the oligotrophic oceans, fixing nitrogen in an area corresponding to half of the Earth’s surface, representing up to 50% of new production in some oligotrophic tropical and subtropical oceans. Whilst &lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium&lt;/i&gt; blooms at the surface exhibit a strong dependence on diazotrophy, colonies at depth or at the surface after a mixing event could be utilising additional N-sources. We conducted experiments to establish how acclimation to varying N-sources affects the growth, elemental composition, light absorption coefficient, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation, PSII electron transport rate and the relationship between net and gross photosynthetic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exchange in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;erythraeum&lt;/i&gt; IMS101. To do this, cultures were acclimated to growth medium containing NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (replete concentrations) or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only (diazotrophic control). The light dependencies of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake were measured using membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS), while PSII electron transport rates were measured from fluorescence light curves (FLCs). We found that at a saturating light intensity, &lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium&lt;/i&gt; growth was ~ 10% and 13% lower when grown on N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than with NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Oxygen uptake increased linearly with net photosynthesis across all light intensities ranging from darkness to 1100 μmol photons m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The maximum rates and initial slopes of light response curves for C-specific gross and net photosynthesis and the slope of the relationship between gross and net photosynthesis increased significantly under non-diazotrophic conditions. We attribute these observations to a reduced expenditure of reductant and ATP for nitrogenase activity under non-diazotrophic conditions which allows NADPH and ATP to be re-directed to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation and/or biosynthesis. The energy and reductant conserved through utilising additional N-sources could enhance &lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium’s&lt;/i&gt; productivity and growth and have major implications for its role in ocean C and N cycles.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195638</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>67433d6e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias G.

We conducted experiments to establish how acclimation to varying N-sources affects the growth, elemental composition, light absorption coefficient, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation, PSII electron transport rate and the relationship between net and gross photosynthetic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exchange in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;erythraeum&lt;/i&gt; IMS101. To do this, cultures were acclimated to growth medium containing NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (replete concentrations) or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only (diazotrophic control). The light dependencies of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake were measured using membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS), while PSII electron transport rates were measured from fluorescence light curves (FLCs). We found that at a saturating light intensity, &lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium&lt;/i&gt; growth was ~ 10% and 13% lower when grown on N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than with NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Oxygen uptake increased linearly with net photosynthesis across all light intensities ranging from darkness to 1100 μmol photons m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The maximum rates and initial slopes of light response curves for C-specific gross and net photosynthesis and the slope of the relationship between gross and net photosynthesis increased significantly under non-diazotrophic conditions. We attribute these observations to a reduced expenditure of reductant and ATP for nitrogenase activity under non-diazotrophic conditions which allows NADPH and ATP to be re-directed to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation and/or biosynthesis. The energy and reductant conserved through utilising additional N-sources could enhance &lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium’s&lt;/i&gt; productivity and growth and have major implications for its role in ocean C and N cycles.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195638</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Tobias G.

Background &lt;p&gt;The survival rate of childhood cancer patients increased over the past decades. However, even after successful treatment the transition back to normalcy is often a major challenge for the whole family. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families in the first years after the end of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA Checklist (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017059782). In November 2016 and September 2017, we searched the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, and Web of Science. We included studies investigating psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors diagnosed under the age of 21, their family members or the family as a whole. Further, we summarized the study characteristics and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results. Finally, we assessed the study quality with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 8215 records based on our database searches and 17 additional records through hand searches. We included 33 articles in the qualitative synthesis. Most of the studies described interventions for the cancer survivor (n = 15). Nine studies investigated interventions for the whole family, and two studies interventions for siblings. The interventions mainly take place in an outpatient group setting (n = 15). Overall, most of the studies reported a significant psychosocial benefit of the interventions. However, the quality of the included studies was limited.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In summary, we identified a broad range of different interventions and thus could give a comprehensive overview of existing interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families. However, there is a necessity for high quality studies. The results may help to optimize health care services that support families with the re-entry into daily life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196151</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>44fd683a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mona Leandra Peikert, Laura Inhestern, Corinna Bergelt&lt;/p&gt;

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an incurable and rare hereditary syndrome. In recent times, treatment with glucocorticoid analogues has been shown to improve the neurological symptoms that characterize this condition, but the molecular mechanism of action of these analogues remains unknown. Hence, the aim of this study was to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of action of glucocorticoid analogues in the treatment of A-T by investigating the role of Dexamethasone (Dexa) in A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines. We used 2DE and tandem MS to identify proteins that were influenced by the drug in A-T cells but not in healthy cells. Thirty-four proteins were defined out of a total of 746±63. Transcriptome analysis was performed by microarray and showed the differential expression of 599 A-T and 362 wild type (WT) genes and a healthy un-matching between protein abundance and the corresponding gene expression variation. The proteomic and transcriptomic profiles allowed the network pathway analysis to pinpoint the biological and molecular functions affected by Dexamethasone in Dexa-treated cells. The present integrated study provides evidence of the molecular mechanism of action of Dexamethasone in an A-T cellular model but also the broader effects of the drug in other tested cell lines.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195388</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>622b1adb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michele Menotta, Sara Orazi, Anna Maria Gioacchini, Chiara Spapperi, Anastasia Ricci, Luciana Chessa, Mauro Magnani&lt;/p&gt;

There is a small but significant negative correlation between the shortest path length between a pair of metabolites and the mutational correlation between those metabolites. Positive association between the centrality of a metabolite and its mutational heritability is consistent with centrally-positioned metabolites presenting a larger mutational target than peripheral ones, and is inconsistent with centrality conferring mutational robustness, at least in toto.

Copper-64 is an attractive radionuclide for PET imaging and is frequently used in clinical applications. The aim of this study was to perform a side-by-side comparison of the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; performance of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (NODAGA = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid,4,7-acetic acid, JR11 = p-Cl-Phe-cyclo(D-Cys-Aph(Hor)-D-Aph(cbm)-Lys-Thr-Cys)D-Tyr-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist, with the clinically used sst2 agonist &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE ((TATE = D-Phe-cyclo(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys)Thr). &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies demonstrated K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; values of 5.7±0.95 nM (Bmax = 4.1±0.18 nM) for the antagonist &lt;sup&gt;64/nat&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 and 20.1±4.4. nM (Bmax = 0.48±0.18 nM) for the agonist &lt;sup&gt;64/nat&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE. Cell uptake studies showed the expected differences between agonists and antagonists. Whereas &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE (the agonist) showed very effective internalization in the cell culture assay (with 50% internalized at 4 hours post-peptide addition under the given experimental conditions), &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (the antagonist) showed little internalization but strong receptor-mediated uptake at the cell membrane. Biodistribution studies of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Specificity of tumor uptake was proven by co-injection of high excess of non-radiolabeled peptide, which led to &gt;80% tumor blocking. &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE showed less favorable pharmacokinetics, with the exception of lower kidney uptake. Blood clearance was distinctly slower and persistent higher blood values were found at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and lung was relatively high and also persistent. The tumor uptake was specific and similar to that of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 at 1 h, but release from the tumor was very fast, particularly between 4 and 24 hours. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios were distinctly lower after 1 hour. This is indicative of insufficient &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; stability.

It has been proposed that NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-specificity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) evolved as an adaptation of microorganisms to grow on acetate as the sole source of carbon and energy. In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, changing the cofactor specificity of ICDH from NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (cofactor swapping) decreases the growth rate on acetate. However, the metabolic basis of this phenotype has not been analyzed. In this work, we used constraint-based modeling to investigate the effect of the cofactor swapping of ICDH in terms of energy production, response of alternative sources of NADPH, and partitioning of fluxes between ICDH and isocitrate lyase (ICL) -a crucial bifurcation when the bacterium grows on acetate-. We generated &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains expressing NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-specific ICDH instead of the native enzyme, and bearing the deletion of the NADPH-producing transhydrogenase PntAB. We measured their growth rate and acetate uptake rate, modeled the distribution of metabolic fluxes by Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and quantified the specific activities of NADPH-producing dehydrogenases in central pathways. The cofactor swapping of ICDH led to one-third decrease in biomass yield, irrespective of the presence of PntAB. According to our simulations, the diminution in growth rate observed upon cofactor swapping could be explained by one-half decrease in the total production of NADPH and a lower availability of carbon for biosynthesis because of a change in the partition at the isocitrate bifurcation. Together with an increased total ATP production, this scenario resulted in a 10-fold increment in the flux of ATP not used for growing purposes. PntAB was identified as the primary NADPH balancing response, with the dehydrogenases of the oxidative branch of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and the malic enzyme playing a role in its absence.

In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, changing the cofactor specificity of ICDH from NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (cofactor swapping) decreases the growth rate on acetate. However, the metabolic basis of this phenotype has not been analyzed. In this work, we used constraint-based modeling to investigate the effect of the cofactor swapping of ICDH in terms of energy production, response of alternative sources of NADPH, and partitioning of fluxes between ICDH and isocitrate lyase (ICL) -a crucial bifurcation when the bacterium grows on acetate-. We generated &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains expressing NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-specific ICDH instead of the native enzyme, and bearing the deletion of the NADPH-producing transhydrogenase PntAB. We measured their growth rate and acetate uptake rate, modeled the distribution of metabolic fluxes by Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and quantified the specific activities of NADPH-producing dehydrogenases in central pathways. The cofactor swapping of ICDH led to one-third decrease in biomass yield, irrespective of the presence of PntAB. According to our simulations, the diminution in growth rate observed upon cofactor swapping could be explained by one-half decrease in the total production of NADPH and a lower availability of carbon for biosynthesis because of a change in the partition at the isocitrate bifurcation. Together with an increased total ATP production, this scenario resulted in a 10-fold increment in the flux of ATP not used for growing purposes. PntAB was identified as the primary NADPH balancing response, with the dehydrogenases of the oxidative branch of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and the malic enzyme playing a role in its absence. We propose that in the context of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; growing on acetate, the NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-specificity of ICDH is a trait that impacts not only NADPH production, but also the efficient allocation of carbon and energy.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196182</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Erick Armingol</name></author><title>Understanding the impact of the cofactor swapping of isocitrate dehydrogenase over the growth phenotype of &amp;lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; on acetate by using constraint-based modeling</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>72</engagement><updated>1524258000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e804:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196182</link><published>1524258000000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006078</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Dotu, Scott I.

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sk4-TYwKrLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Dotu, Scott I.

Given the frequency with which MAP kinase signaling is dysregulated in cancer, much effort has been focused on inhibiting RAS signaling for therapeutic benefit. KSR1, a pseudokinase that interacts with RAF, is a potential target; it was originally cloned in screens for suppressors of constitutively active RAS, and its deletion prevents RAS-mediated transformation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In this work, we used a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer to assess whether KSR1 deletion would influence tumor development in the setting of oncogenic RAS. We found that &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice on this background had a modest but significant improvement in all-cause morbidity compared to &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; cohorts. &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, however, still developed tumors, and precursor pancreatic intraepithelial neoplastic (PanIN) lesions were detected within a similar timeframe compared to &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice. No significant differences in pERK expression or in proliferation were noted. RNA sequencing also did not reveal any unique genetic signature in &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; tumors. Further studies will be needed to determine whether and in what settings KSR inhibition may be clinically useful.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194998</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>54f2f74c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth A.

The Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), &lt;i&gt;Ceratitis capitata&lt;/i&gt; (Wiedemann), is a key pest of fruit crops in many tropical, subtropical and mild temperate areas worldwide. The economic importance of this fruit fly is increasing due to its invasion of new geographical areas. Efficient control and eradication efforts require adequate information regarding &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; adults in relation to environmental and physiological cues. This would allow effective characterisation of the population spatio-temporal dynamic of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; population at both the orchard level and the area-wide landscape.
The aim of this study was to analyse population patterns of adult medflies caught using two trapping systems in a peach orchard located in central Italy. They were differentiated by adult sex (males or females) and mating status of females (unmated or mated females) to determine the spatio-temporal dynamic and evaluate the effect of cultivar and chemical treatments on trap catches. Female mating status was assessed by spermathecal dissection and a blind test was carried out to evaluate the reliability of the technique. Geostatistical methods, variogram and kriging, were used to produce distributional maps. Results showed a strong correlation between the distribution of males and unmated females, whereas males versus mated females and unmated females versus mated females showed a lower correlation. Both cultivar and chemical treatments had significant effects on trap catches, showing associations with sex and female mating status. Medfly adults showed aggregated distributions in the experimental field, but hot spots locations varied. The spatial pattern of unmated females reflected that of males, whereas mated females were largely distributed around ripening or ripe fruit. The results give relevant insights into pest management. Mated females may be distributed differently to unmated females and the identification of male hot spots through monitoring would allow localisation of virgin female populations. Based on our results, a more precise IPM strategy, coupled with effective sanitation practices, could represent a more effective approach to medfly control.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195097</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9bff587c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Sciarretta, Maria Rosaria Tabilio, Elena Lampazzi, Claudio Ceccaroli, Marco Colacci, Pasquale Trematerra&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The ageing population and the expected increase in the number of elderly patients make an evidence-based assessment of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in old patients progressively more important. Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO results for patient aged &amp;lt;65 years is well known. However, the risk profile and in-hospital prognosis of advanced age patients with ECMO still need more investigation. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predicted the outcomes for elderly patients who received VA-ECMO.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this retrospective study, medical records for patients with ECMO aged 65 years and over were collected between 2009 and 2012 at a tertiary hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 99 patients (mean age: 76.4±6.4 years) were included. The most common condition requiring VA-ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. Among survivors on VA-ECMO, 28 (28.3%) patients were successfully weaned from support. Thirteen (13.1%) patients were successfully discharged. We found that cardiogenic shock (OR = 3.158, P = 0.013), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR = 1.147, P&amp;lt;0.001), and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) score (OR = 1.054, P = 0.001) were risk factors associated with survival on VA-ECMO. By using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, the APACHE II score and SAPS II score displayed acceptable discriminative power (AUC 0.722; 0.715, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the risk of mortality increases with cardiogenic shock, higher APACHE II score, and higher SAPS II score.

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of anaphylaxis-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the first step toward developing preventative strategies and optimizing care systems. We aimed to describe and compare epidemiological features and clinical outcomes among patients with anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs according to causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified emergency medical service (EMS)-treated anaphylaxis-associated OHCA patients from a nationwide OHCA registry between 2008 and 2015. We compared epidemiological characteristics and outcomes according to causal agents (a natural agents group and an iatrogenic agents group) and evaluated temporal variability in incidence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare survival to discharge between causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the study period (8 years), the total number of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs was 233. A total of 224 eligible cases were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients (85.6%) in the natural agents group and 32 patients (14.3%) in the iatrogenic agents group. There was significant diurnal and seasonal variability in the frequency of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values&amp;lt;0.01 for both), with the highest incidences occurring during the day (7:01 am to 3 pm; 64.6%) and in summer (June to August, 48.7%). Compared with the natural agents group, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for survival to discharge in the iatrogenic agents group was statistically insignificant (AOR 3.61, 95% CI 0.86 to 15.06).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is considerably low, and significant temporal variability, with a peak during the day and in summer, is evident.

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. On high-resolution manometry (HRM), impaired LES relaxation is defined by elevated integrated relaxation pressure (IRP). However, a new category of achalasia within the normal IRP range has been suggested.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;HRM was performed using a Starlet device and an IRP threshold of 26 mmHg. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) was performed for cases of achalasia diagnosed using established methods. During POEM, the histology of the LES was assessed. Follow-up was performed 2 months post-operatively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-one patients with achalasia (18 women, mean age 53 ± 18.6 years) were included. Among them, 27 were placed in the IRP &gt; 26 mmHg subgroup (impaired LES relaxation on HRM) and 14 in the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup (normal LES relaxation on HRM). In the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup, patients were older, had longer symptom duration, and had more esophageal dilation.

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. On high-resolution manometry (HRM), impaired LES relaxation is defined by elevated integrated relaxation pressure (IRP). However, a new category of achalasia within the normal IRP range has been suggested.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;HRM was performed using a Starlet device and an IRP threshold of 26 mmHg. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) was performed for cases of achalasia diagnosed using established methods. During POEM, the histology of the LES was assessed. Follow-up was performed 2 months post-operatively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-one patients with achalasia (18 women, mean age 53 ± 18.6 years) were included. Among them, 27 were placed in the IRP &gt; 26 mmHg subgroup (impaired LES relaxation on HRM) and 14 in the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup (normal LES relaxation on HRM). In the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup, patients were older, had longer symptom duration, and had more esophageal dilation. The IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup had the same symptom severity as the higher IRP subgroup and POEM significantly improved symptoms and IRP, although four patients still had severe LES fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The clinical presentation of achalasia has a gap between a HRM-defined impaired LES relaxation, with aging or disease progression considered reasons for a lowered LES pressure. POEM can be a feasible treatment option, even for cases of achalasia with a normal IRP. However, patients with severe LES fibrosis need more attention for the therapeutic indication.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195423</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Hiroki Sato</name></author><title>A clinical study of peroral endoscopic myotomy reveals that impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation in achalasia is not only defined by high-resolution manometry</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522702800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7693c:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195423</link><published>1522702800000</published></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25181?af=R</originId><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1522925554799</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>af45e730</fingerprint><description>We introduce TopoMS, a computational tool enabling detailed topological analysis of molecular and condensed‐matter systems, including the computation of atomic volumes and charges through the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, as well as the complete molecular graph.

Damaged cartilage has very low regenerative potential which has led to the search for novel tissue-engineering approaches to help treat cartilage defects. While various approaches have been reported, there is no perfect treatment currently. In this study we evaluated the effects of a plant extract, chlorogenic acid (CGA), as part of chondrocyte transplantation on a model of knee joint injury in chicks. First, primary cultured chondrocytes used to evaluate the effects of CGA on chondrogenesis. Then using an articular cartilage injury model of chick knee we assessed the functional recovery after transplantation of the complexes containing chondrocytes and CGA in an alginate scaffold. Histological analysis, PCR, and western blot were further used to understand the underlying mechanisms. We showed that 60 μM CGA in alginate exhibited notable effects on stimulating chondrogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Secondly, it was shown that the application of these complexes accelerated the recovery of injury-induced dysfunction by gait analysis when followed for 21 days. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that there was less abnormal vasculature formation, more chondrocyte proliferation and cartilage matrix synthesis in the presence of the complexes containing CGA. We discovered CGA treated transplantation up-regulated the expressions of Sox9 and Col2a1 which were responsible for the stimulation of chondrogenesis. Furthermore, the application of these complexes could suppress the abnormal angiogenesis and fibrosis at the injury site. Lastly, the elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, p-p65, and MMPs expression were decreased in the presence of CGA. This may be caused through adjusting cellular redox homeostasis associated with Nrf2. This study suggests that combining chondrocytes and CGA on an alginate scaffold can improve the recovery of damaged articular cartilage.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195326</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fc2b41b5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xin Cheng, Ke Li, Shengsong Xu, Peizhi Li, Yu Yan, Guang Wang, Zachary Berman, Rui Guo, Jianxin Liang, Sira Traore, Xuesong Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterised by pancreatic beta cell destruction and absolute insulin deficiency. The strongest predictor of diabetes complications is glycaemic control and achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0% is the primary management target. However, standard treatment appears to be lacking and adjunctive strategies require consideration. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effect of low-carbohydrate diets on type 1 diabetes management. Four databases were searched from inception until 28 March 2017: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; and EMBASE. All primary studies containing a methods section (excluding cross-sectional) were included. Reports had to quantitatively measure the effect(s) of a dietary intervention or observed intake over at least two weeks where carbohydrate is below 45% total energy in adults and/or children with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was HbA1c and secondary outcomes were severe hypoglycaemia, total daily insulin, BMI, quality of life and mean daily glucose. Seventy-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and nine were included (two randomised controlled trials, four pre-post interventions, two case-series, one case-report). Eight studies reported a mean change in HbA1c with a low-carbohydrate diet. Of these, four reported a non-significant change (P ≥ 0.05) and three reported statistically significant reductions (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia, five reported total insulin, three reported BMI, and one reported blood glucose. Due to the significant heterogeneity of included studies, an overall effect could not be determined. This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194987</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>30b1893b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica L.

Any single nucleotide variant detection study could benefit from a fast and cheap method of measuring the quality of variant call list. It is advantageous to be able to see how the call list quality is affected by different variant filtering thresholds and other adjustments to the study parameters. Here we look into a possibility of estimating the proportion of true positives in a single nucleotide variant call list for human data. Using whole-exome and whole-genome gold standard data sets for training, we focus on building a generic model that only relies on information available from any variant caller. We assess and compare the performance of different candidate models based on their practical accuracy. We find that the generic model delivers decent accuracy most of the time. Further, we conclude that its performance could be improved substantially by leveraging the variant quality metrics that are specific to each variant calling tool.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196058</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1e3cd641</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nik Tuzov&lt;/p&gt;

Modulating immune responses to sepsis and trauma remain one of the most difficult challenges in modern medicine. Large burn injuries (LBI) are a severe form of trauma associated with sepsis, immune impairment, and mortality. Immune dysfunction after LBI is complex, involving both enhanced and impaired immune activation. The release of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), such as HMGB1, and cytokines (e.g. IL-1β) creates an environment of immune dysfunction often leading to end organ failure and death. Both HMGB1 and IL-1β have been found to play critical roles in sepsis and post-burn immune dysfunction. HMGB1 and IL-1β have been shown previously to form potent complexes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We recently identified the presence of HMGB1/IL-1β heterocomplexes in human tissue. We now find HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in human and mouse plasma, and identify a synergistic role of HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in post-burn immune dysfunction. In both humans and mice, we found that HMGB1 was enriched in plasma microvesicles (MVs) after LBI. HMGB1 was found form complexes with IL-1β. Using flow cytometry of mouse plasma MVs, we identified an increase in an HMGB1+/IL-1β+ MVs. Using co-IP, HMGB1 was found to bind the pro-form of IL-1β in mouse and human plasma. Pro-IL-1β, which is traditionally considered inactive, became active when complexed with HMGB1. Human THP-1 monocytes treated with HMGB1-pro-IL-1β complexes showed increased transcription of LBI associated cytokines IL-6 and IFNβ along with suppression of iNOS, mimicking findings associated with LBI. These findings identify that HMGB1/IL-1β complexes released after burn injuries can modulate immune responses, and microvesicles are identified as a novel reservoir for these immune mediators. These complexes might serve as novel immune targets for the treatment of systemic immune responses due to LBI or other causes of sepsis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195335</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>194fb99a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leon G.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Using our previously developed and tested Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Stigma Scale, we investigated factors associated with perceived SRH stigma among adolescent girls in Ghana.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We drew upon data from our survey study of 1,063 females 15-24yrs recruited from community- and clinic-based sites in two Ghanaian cities. Our Adolescent SRH Stigma Scale comprised 20 items and 3 sub-scales (Internalized, Enacted, Lay Attitudes) to measure stigma occurring with sexual activity, contraceptive use, pregnancy, abortion and family planning service use. We assessed relationships between a comprehensive set of demographic, health and social factors and SRH Stigma with multi-level multivariable linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In unadjusted bivariate analyses, compared to their counterparts, SRH stigma scores were higher among girls who were younger, Accra residents, Muslim, still in/dropped out of secondary school, unemployed, reporting excellent/very good health, not in a relationship, not sexually experienced, never received family planning services, never used contraception, but had been pregnant (all p-values &amp;lt;0.05). In multivariable models, higher SRH stigma scores were associated with history of pregnancy (β = 1.53, CI = 0.51,2.56) and excellent/very good self-rated health (β = 0.89, CI = 0.20,1.58), while lower stigma scores were associated with older age (β = -0.17, 95%CI = -0.24,-0.09), higher educational attainment (β = -1.22, CI = -1.82,-0.63), and sexual intercourse experience (β = -1.32, CI = -2.10,-0.55).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings provide insight into factors contributing to SRH stigma among this young Ghanaian female sample. Further research disentangling the complex interrelationships between SRH stigma, health, and social context is needed to guide multi-level interventions to address SRH stigma and its causes and consequences for adolescents worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195163</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>433a030a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kelli Stidham Hall, Emmanuel Morhe, Abubakar Manu, Lisa H.

In multivariable models, higher SRH stigma scores were associated with history of pregnancy (β = 1.53, CI = 0.51,2.56) and excellent/very good self-rated health (β = 0.89, CI = 0.20,1.58), while lower stigma scores were associated with older age (β = -0.17, 95%CI = -0.24,-0.09), higher educational attainment (β = -1.22, CI = -1.82,-0.63), and sexual intercourse experience (β = -1.32, CI = -2.10,-0.55).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings provide insight into factors contributing to SRH stigma among this young Ghanaian female sample. Further research disentangling the complex interrelationships between SRH stigma, health, and social context is needed to guide multi-level interventions to address SRH stigma and its causes and consequences for adolescents worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195163</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Kelli Stidham Hall</name></author><title>Factors associated with sexual and reproductive health stigma among adolescent girls in Ghana</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522702800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76925:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195163</link><published>1522702800000</published></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E3863.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>In PNAS, Fan et al.

The natural alkaloid berberine has been ascribed numerous health benefits including lipid and cholesterol reduction and improved insulin sensitivity in diabetics. However, oral (PO) administration of berberine is hindered by poor bioavailability and increasing dose often elicits gastro-intestinal side effects. To overcome the caveats associated with oral berberine, we developed transdermal (TD) formulations of berberine (BBR) and the berberine precursor dihydroberberine (DHB). These formulations were compared to oral BBR using pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and general safety studies &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To complete this work, a sensitive quantitative LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated according the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical methods to simultaneously measure berberine, simvastatin, and simvastatin hydroxy acid with relative quantification used for the berberine metabolite demethylene berberine glucuronide (DBG). Acute pharmacokinetics in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated a statistically relevant ranking for berberine bioavailability based upon AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-8&lt;/sub&gt; as DHB TD &gt; BBR TD &gt;&gt; BBR PO with similar ranking for the metabolite DBG, indicating that transdermal administration achieves BBR levels well above oral administration. Similarly, chronic administration (14 days) resulted in significantly higher levels of circulating BBR and DBG in DHB TD treated animals. Chronically treated rats were given a single dose of simvastatin with no observed change in the drugs bioavailability compared with control, suggesting the increased presence of BBR had no effect on simvastatin metabolism. This observation was further supported by consistent CYP3A4 expression across all treatment groups. Moreover, no changes in kidney and liver biomarkers, including alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, were observed between treatment formats, and confirming previous reports that BBR has no effect on HMG-CoA expression. This study supports the safe use of transdermal compositions that improve on the poor bioavailability of oral berberine and have the potential to be more efficacious in the treatment of dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194979</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2548997e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beth Buchanan, Qingfang Meng, Mathieu-Marc Poulin, Jonathan Zuccolo, Chike Godwin Azike, Joseph Gabriele, David Charles Baranowski&lt;/p&gt;

The relationship between body height and the risk of non‒communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer has been the subject of much debate in the epidemiological literature. Concerns have recently arisen over spurious associations due to confounding factors like birth cohort, especially in the context of epidemiological transition. The population of Sardinia represents an interesting case study, as the average physical stature of inhabitants was the lowest recorded in Europe until a few decades ago. In this population we tested whether height is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cancer. We analysed the stature of 10,427 patients undergoing endoscopy for any reason, for whom a detailed clinical history of cardiovascular disease and/or malignancies had been documented. Poisson regression modelling was used to test the association between stature and disease risk. When patients were subdivided according to sex and height tertiles, the risk of cardiovascular disease proved significantly greater for subjects in the lowest tertile irrespective of sex (men: 1.87; 95%CI 1.41‒2.47; women: 1.23; 95%CI 0.92‒1.66) and smaller for those in the highest tertile (men: 0.51; 95%CI 0.35‒0.75; women: 0.41; 95%CI 0.27‒0.61). However, after adjusting the risk for birth cohort and established risk factors, it mostly resulted in non-significant values, although the overall trend persisted.

The relationship between body height and the risk of non‒communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer has been the subject of much debate in the epidemiological literature. Concerns have recently arisen over spurious associations due to confounding factors like birth cohort, especially in the context of epidemiological transition. The population of Sardinia represents an interesting case study, as the average physical stature of inhabitants was the lowest recorded in Europe until a few decades ago. In this population we tested whether height is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cancer. We analysed the stature of 10,427 patients undergoing endoscopy for any reason, for whom a detailed clinical history of cardiovascular disease and/or malignancies had been documented. Poisson regression modelling was used to test the association between stature and disease risk. When patients were subdivided according to sex and height tertiles, the risk of cardiovascular disease proved significantly greater for subjects in the lowest tertile irrespective of sex (men: 1.87; 95%CI 1.41‒2.47; women: 1.23; 95%CI 0.92‒1.66) and smaller for those in the highest tertile (men: 0.51; 95%CI 0.35‒0.75; women: 0.41; 95%CI 0.27‒0.61). However, after adjusting the risk for birth cohort and established risk factors, it mostly resulted in non-significant values, although the overall trend persisted. Similar results were obtained for all-cancer risk (relative risk for men and women in the lowest tertile: 1.44; 95%CI 1.09–1.90 and 1.17; 95%CI 0.93–1.48, in the highest tertile: 0.51; 95%CI 0.36–0.72 and 0.62; 95%CI 0.47–0.81, respectively) as well as for some of the most common types of cancer. We concluded that the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and malignancies does not vary significantly with stature in the Sardinian population, after adjusting for birth cohort and more obvious risk factors.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0190888</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Giovanni Mario Pes</name></author><title>The association of adult height with the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in the population of Sardinia</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524258000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7eb:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0190888</link><published>1524258000000</published></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24976?af=R</originId><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/1096987x/39/14&quot;&gt;Volume 39, Issue 14&lt;/a&gt;, Page 815-819, May 30, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523899941694</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a3c165c8</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 14, Page 815-819, May 30, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24976?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><title>Issue Information</title><unread>True</unread><published>1523080419000</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162cf83c33e:2b08249:7d6c1c1c</id><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24976?af=R</link><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 14, Page 815-819, May 30, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS009286741830299X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D7ab6336e831f244534f81ed846e961c6</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741830299X</canonicalUrl><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>375</height><url>http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S009286741830299X-fx1.jpg</url><width>375</width></visual><crawled>1523662580928</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell</title><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/7051</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fa0556d1</fingerprint><description>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Amanda J.

Based on our studies and previous reports, src kinase inhibition may represent a novel paradigm of multi-action therapeutics - corrector, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infective - in CF.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288324v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Wang, Y.</name></author><title>PP-2, a src-kinase inhibitor, is a potential corrector for F508del-CFTR in cystic fibrosis [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>False</unread><engagement>33</engagement><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1625ad4c1ec:50d350e:34f43e70</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288324v1?rss=1</link><published>1521874800000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04883-x</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newfound chameleon species flashes rainbow colours and a nose like Pinocchio’s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newfound chameleon species flashes rainbow colours and a nose like Pinocchio’s, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04883-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04883-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Resplendent reptile and two similar species have been discovered in the remote forests of Madagascar.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04883-x/d41586-018-04883-x_15675512.jpg</url><width>1024</width></visual><crawled>1524169872321</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fa8a2aa7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newfound chameleon species flashes rainbow colours and a nose like Pinocchio’s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newfound chameleon species flashes rainbow colours and a nose like Pinocchio’s, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04883-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04883-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Resplendent reptile and two similar species have been discovered in the remote forests of Madagascar.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04883-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><title>Newfound chameleon species flashes rainbow colours and a nose like Pinocchio’s</title><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>1.55</engagementRate><engagement>642</engagement><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162df9a93c1:46833c3:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04883-x</link><published>1524121200000</published></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3741.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) product, pRB, is common in many human cancers.

There is a marked comorbidity between alcohol abuse and eating disorders, especially in the young population. We have previously reported that bingeing on fat during adolescence increases the rewarding effects of ethanol (EtOH). The aim of the present work was to study if vulnerability to EtOH persists after cessation of binge eating. OF1 mice binged on fat (HFB: high-fat binge) during adolescence (PND 25–43) and were tested for 15 days after the last access to HFB (on PND 59) using the self-administration paradigm, the conditioned place preference (CPP) and locomotor sensitization to ethanol. Our results showed that after 15 days of cessation of fat ingestion, mice increased their consumption of ethanol and showed greater motivation to obtain ethanol. On the other hand, no effects were observed in the CPP, while an increased locomotor response to ethanol was detected. The present results confirm and extend our previous study demonstrating that the compulsive intake of fat induces long-lasting effects on the reward system that lead to an increased consumption of EtOH.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194431</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9984bae5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by M.

European plum (&lt;i&gt;Prunus domestica&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an ancient domesticated species cultivated in temperate areas worldwide whose genetic structure has been scarcely analyzed to date. In this study, a broad representation of Spanish European plum germplasm collected in Northeastern Spain and a representative set of reference cultivars were compared using nuclear and chloroplast markers. The number of alleles per locus detected with the SSR markers ranged from 8 to 39, with an average of 23.4 alleles, and 8 haplotypes were identified. Bayesian model-based clustering, minimum spanning networks, and the analysis of molecular variance showed the existence of a hierarchical structure. At the first level, two genetic groups were found, one containing ‘Reine Claude’ type reference cultivars altogether with ca. 25% of local genotypes, and a second one much more diverse. This latter group split in two groups, one containing most (ca. 70%) local genotypes and some old Spanish and French reference cultivars, whereas the other included 24 reference cultivars and only six local genotypes. A third partition level allowed a significant finer delineation into five groups. As a whole, the genetic structure of European plum from Northeastern Spain was shown to be complex and conditioned by a geographical proximity factor. This study not only contributes to genetic conservation and breeding for this species at the national level, but also supports the relevance of undertaking similar tasks of collection and characterization in other unexplored areas. Moreover, this kind of research could lead to future coordinated actions for the examination of the whole European plum diversity, to define conservation strategies, and could be used to better understand the genetic control of traits of horticultural interest through association mapping.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195591</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ec946bba</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jorge Urrestarazu, Pilar Errea, Carlos Miranda, Luis G.

Transgenic rat models of Alzheimer’s disease were used to examine differences in memory and brain histology. Double transgenic female rats (APP+PS1) over-expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) and single transgenic rats (APP21) over-expressing human APP were compared with wild type Fischer rats (WT). The Barnes maze assessed learning and memory and showed that both APP21 and APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors than the WT rats during the acquisition phase, signifying slower learning. Additionally, the APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors following a retention interval, indicating impaired memory compared to both the APP21 and WT rats. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody against amyloid-β (Aβ) showed extensive and mostly diffuse Aβ plaques in the hippocampus and dense plaques that contained tau in the cortex of the brains of the APP+PS1 rats. Furthermore, the APP+PS1 rats also showed vascular changes, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy with extensive Aβ deposits in cortical and leptomeningeal blood vessel walls and venous collagenosis. In addition to the Aβ accumulation observed in arterial, venous, and capillary walls, APP+PS1 rats also displayed enlarged blood vessels and perivascular space. Overall, the brain histopathology and behavioral assessment showed that the APP+PS1 rats demonstrated behavioral characteristics and vascular changes similar to those commonly observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195469</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>82314836</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Klakotskaia, Cansu Agca, Rachel A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Dietary diversity scores (DDS) are considered as metrics for monitoring the implementation of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, but they need to be rigorously evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine two DDS, the Food Groups Index (FGI), and the Minimum Dietary Diversity-Women (MDD-W), alongside two dietary quality scores, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010) and the Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS), with risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs).&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The analysis included 21,312 (GDM) and 19,917 (HDPs) singleton births reported in the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort (1991–2001), among women without major chronic disease or GDM/HDPs. Scores were derived using prepregnancy diet collected by a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable models were utilized to calculate relative risks (RR) and confidence intervals (95%CIs).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Incident GDM (n = 916) and HDPs (n = 1,421) were reported. The MDD-W and FGI were not associated with risk of GDM or HDPs, but the AHEI-2010 and PDQS were associated with a lower risk of GDM and marginally lower risk of HDP. The RR’s of GDM comparing the highest vs. lowest quintiles were 1.00 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.27; p-trend = 0.82) for MDD-W, 0.96 (95%CI: 0.76, 1.22; p-trend = 0.88) for FGI, 0.63 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.81; p-trend &amp;lt;0.0001) for the AHEI-2010 and 0.68 (95%CI: 0.54, 0.86; p-trend = 0.003) for the PDQS. Similarly, the RR’s of HDPs were 0.92 (95%CI: 0.75, 1.12, p-trend = 0.94) for MDD-W, 0.97 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.17; p-trend = 0.83) for FGI, 0.84 (95%CI: 0.70, 1.02; p-trend = 0.07) for AHEI-2010 and 0.89 (95%CI: 0.74, 1.09; p-trend = 0.07) for PDQS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MDD-W and FGI did not predict the risk of GDM and HDPs. These DDS should not be widely used as metrics for achieving dietary goals in their present form. The Prime Diet Quality Score warrants further testing as a promising measure of a sustainable and healthy diet on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195103</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>140a2b27</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Selma Gicevic, Audrey J.

Understanding the determinants of syntactic choice in sentence production is a salient topic in psycholinguistics. Existing evidence suggests that syntactic choice results from an interplay between linguistic and non-linguistic factors, and a speaker’s attention to the elements of a described event represents one such factor. Whereas multimodal accounts of attention suggest a role for different modalities in this process, existing studies examining attention effects in syntactic choice are primarily based on visual cueing paradigms. Hence, it remains unclear whether attentional effects on syntactic choice are limited to the visual modality or are indeed more general. This issue is addressed by the current study. Native English participants viewed and described line drawings of simple transitive events while their attention was directed to the location of the agent or the patient of the depicted event by means of either an &lt;i&gt;auditory&lt;/i&gt; (monaural beep) or a &lt;i&gt;motor&lt;/i&gt; (unilateral key press) lateral cue. Our results show an effect of cue location, with participants producing more passive-voice descriptions in the patient-cued conditions. Crucially, this cue location effect emerged in the motor-cue but not (or substantially less so) in the auditory-cue condition, as confirmed by a reliable interaction between &lt;i&gt;cue location&lt;/i&gt; (agent vs. patient) and &lt;i&gt;cue type&lt;/i&gt; (auditory vs. motor). Our data suggest that attentional effects on the speaker’s syntactic choices are modality-specific and limited to the visual and motor, but not the auditory, domain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195547</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>43835f7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mikhail Pokhoday, Christoph Scheepers, Yury Shtyrov, Andriy Myachykov&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Body Mass Index (BMI), like most human phenotypes, is substantially heritable. However, BMI is not normally distributed; the skew appears to be structural, and increases as a function of age. Moreover, twin correlations for BMI commonly violate the assumptions of the most common variety of the classical twin model, with the MZ twin correlation greater than twice the DZ correlation. This study aimed to decompose twin correlations for BMI using more general skew-t distributions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Same sex MZ and DZ twin pairs (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 7,086) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry were included. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to decompose twin correlations for BMI into multiple mixture distributions. LPA was performed using the default normal mixture distribution and the skew-t mixture distribution. Similar analyses were performed for height as a comparison. Our analyses are then replicated in an independent dataset.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A two-class solution under the skew-t mixture distribution fits the BMI distribution for both genders. The first class consists of a relatively normally distributed, highly heritable BMI with a mean in the normal range. The second class is a positively skewed BMI in the overweight and obese range, with lower twin correlations. In contrast, height is normally distributed, highly heritable, and is well-fit by a single latent class. Results in the replication dataset were highly similar.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that two distinct processes underlie the skew of the BMI distribution. The contrast between height and weight is in accord with subjective psychological experience: both are under obvious genetic influence, but BMI is also subject to behavioral control, whereas height is not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194968</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c59c7c25</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siny Tsang, Glen E.

The contrast between height and weight is in accord with subjective psychological experience: both are under obvious genetic influence, but BMI is also subject to behavioral control, whereas height is not.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194968</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Siny Tsang</name></author><title>Differential models of twin correlations in skew for body-mass index (BMI)</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424d:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194968</link><published>1522270800000</published></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024553?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/15&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1524294006306</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f18f43ae</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024553?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Carmen Lucía Moraila-Martínez</name></author><title>An experimental/theoretical method to measure the capacitive compactness of an aqueous electrolyte surrounding a spherical charged colloid</title><unread>True</unread><published>1524139350000</published><engagement>0</engagement><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162e700b622:51b1d18:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024553?af=R</link><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04489-3</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How San Francisco’s next big quake could play out&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How San Francisco’s next big quake could play out, Published online: 18 April 2018;

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be overcome by electrical stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) via a cochlear implant (CI). Restricted CI performance results from the spatial gap between the SGNs and the electrode, but the efficacy of CI is also limited by the degeneration of SGNs as one consequence of SHNL. In the healthy cochlea, the survival of SGNs is assured by endogenous neurotrophic support. Several applications of exogenous neurotrophic supply have been shown to reduce SGN degeneration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In the present study, nanoporous silica nanoparticles (NPSNPs), with an approximate diameter of &amp;lt;100 nm, were loaded with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to test their efficacy as long-term delivery system for neurotrophins. The neurotrophic factor was released constantly from the NPSNPs over a release period of 80 days when the surface of the nanoparticles had been modified with amino groups. Cell culture investigations with NIH3T3 fibroblasts attest a good general cytocompatibility of the NPSNPs. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments with SGNs indicate a significantly higher survival rate of SGNs in cell cultures that contained BDNF-loaded nanoparticles compared to the control culture with unloaded NPSNPs (p&amp;lt;0.001). Importantly, also the amounts of BDNF released up to a time period of 39 days increased the survival rate of SGNs. Thus, NPSNPs carrying BDNF are suitable for the treatment of inner ear disease and for the protection and the support of SGNs. Their nanoscale nature and the fact that a direct contact of the nanoparticles and the SGNs is not necessary for neuroprotective effects, should allow for the facile preparation of nanocomposites, e.g., with biocompatible polymers, to install coatings on implants for the realization of implant-based growth factor delivery systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194778</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8ab24b99</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadeschda Schmidt, Jennifer Schulze, Dawid P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; isolates sharing identical DNA fingerprint patterns can be epidemiologically linked. However, municipal health services in the Netherlands are able to confirm an epidemiological link in only around 23% of the patients with isolates clustered by the conventional variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genotyping. This research aims to investigate whether whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a more reliable predictor of epidemiological links between tuberculosis patients than VNTR genotyping.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;VNTR genotyping and WGS were performed in parallel on all &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; complex isolates received at the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in 2016. Isolates were clustered by VNTR when they shared identical 24-loci VNTR patterns; isolates were assigned to a WGS cluster when the pair-wise genetic distance was ≤ 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Cluster investigation was performed by municipal health services on all isolates clustered by VNTR in 2016. The proportion of epidemiological links identified among patients clustered by either method was calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 535 isolates were genotyped, of which 25% (134/535) were clustered by VNTR and 14% (76/535) by WGS; the concordance between both typing methods was 86%. The proportion of epidemiological links among WGS clustered cases (57%) was twice as common than among VNTR clustered cases (31%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;When WGS was applied, the number of clustered isolates was halved, while all epidemiologically linked cases remained clustered. WGS is therefore a more reliable tool to predict epidemiological links between tuberculosis cases than VNTR genotyping and will allow more efficient transmission tracing, as epidemiological investigations based on false clustering can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195413</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c5d67f74</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rana Jajou, Albert de Neeling, Rianne van Hunen, Gerard de Vries, Henrieke Schimmel, Arnout Mulder, Richard Anthony, Wim van der Hoek, Dick van Soolingen&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Phenylephrine is an α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adrenergic receptor agonist that causes pulmonary vasoconstriction, and so may effectively enhance hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, there is little evidence that phenylephrine augments HPV in clinical situations. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of phenylephrine infusion on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Included patients were those undergoing elective thoracic surgery in the lateral decubitus position with OLV. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The N-P group initially had OLV with normal saline infusion for 30 minutes; after a 10 minute interval, OLV was then maintained with phenylephrine infusion for 30 minutes. The P-N group had the drug-infusion in the reverse order. The primary outcome was arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Secondary outcomes were mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure variation, perfusion index, and difference between bladder and skin temperature.

Background &lt;p&gt;Phenylephrine is an α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adrenergic receptor agonist that causes pulmonary vasoconstriction, and so may effectively enhance hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, there is little evidence that phenylephrine augments HPV in clinical situations. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of phenylephrine infusion on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Included patients were those undergoing elective thoracic surgery in the lateral decubitus position with OLV. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The N-P group initially had OLV with normal saline infusion for 30 minutes; after a 10 minute interval, OLV was then maintained with phenylephrine infusion for 30 minutes. The P-N group had the drug-infusion in the reverse order. The primary outcome was arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Secondary outcomes were mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure variation, perfusion index, and difference between bladder and skin temperature. Statistical analysis was performed using the student t-test, Fisher&apos;s exact test, and ANOVA for Cross-over design. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine patients were analyzed. Although phenylephrine infusion significantly increased mean arterial pressure (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), arterial partial pressure of oxygen did not differ between the two timepoints (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.19). There was no carryover effect in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.14). Phenylephrine infusion significantly decreased heart rate (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) and pulse pressure variation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Phenylephrine infusion did not improve oxygenation during OLV. The present results indicate that phenylephrine does not have clinically meaningful effects on HPV.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;University Hospital Medical Information Network 000024317&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195576</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Kohei Godai</name></author><title>Phenylephrine does not improve oxygenation during one-lung ventilation: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523307600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715297:9aea0a7d</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195576</link><published>1523307600000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00174</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00174/20180413/images/medium/mp-2018-001746_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00174&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

With over 1 million species on earth, each biologically unique, do we have any hope of understanding whether species will persist in a warming world? We might, because it turns out that there is surprising regularity in how warming accelerates the major metabolic processes that power life. A persistent challenge has been to understand ecological effects of temperature in the context of species interactions, especially when individuals not only experience temperature but also mortality due to parasitism or predation. Kirk et al. have shown how the effects of parasites vary with warming in a manner entirely consistent with general temperature dependence of host and parasite metabolism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/u5e7Nju7vII&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mary I.

Neurons require a nearly constant supply of ATP. Glucose is the predominant source of brain ATP, but the direct effects of prolonged glucose deprivation on neuronal viability and function remain unclear. In sparse rat hippocampal microcultures, neurons were surprisingly resilient to 16 h glucose removal in the absence of secondary excitotoxicity. Neuronal survival and synaptic transmission were unaffected by prolonged removal of exogenous glucose. Inhibition of lactate transport decreased microculture neuronal survival during concurrent glucose deprivation, suggesting that endogenously released lactate is important for tolerance to glucose deprivation. Tandem depolarization and glucose deprivation also reduced neuronal survival, and trace glucose concentrations afforded neuroprotection. Mass cultures, in contrast to microcultures, were insensitive to depolarizing glucose deprivation, a difference attributable to increased extracellular lactate levels. Removal of local astrocyte support did not reduce survival in response to glucose deprivation or alter evoked excitatory transmission, suggesting that on-demand, local lactate shuttling is not necessary for neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose removal. Taken together, these data suggest that endogenously produced lactate available globally in the extracellular milieu sustains neurons in the absence of glucose. A better understanding of resilience mechanisms in reduced preparations could lead to therapeutic strategies aimed to bolster these mechanisms in vulnerable neuronal populations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195520</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7698fc0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Courtney Sobieski, Natasha Warikoo, Hong-Jin Shu, Steven Mennerick&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to examine whether mothers’ musical background has an effect on their own and their children’s sedentary behavior (SB) and physical activity (PA). The aim was also to assess children’s and their mothers’ exercise adherence when using movement-to-music video program.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Sub-group analysis of an intervention group in a randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN33885819).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Seventy-one mother-child-pairs were divided into two categories based on mothers’ musical background. Each pair performed 8 weeks exercise intervention using movement-to-music video program. SB and PA were assessed objectively by accelerometer, and exercise activity, fidelity, and enjoyment were assessed via exercise diaries and questionnaires. Logistic regression model was used to analyze associations in the main outcomes between the groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Those children whose mothers had musical background (MB) had greater probability to increase their light PA during the intervention, but not moderate-to-vigorous PA compared to those children whose mothers did not have musical background (NMB). SB increased in both groups. Mothers in the NMB group had greater probability to increase their light and moderate-to-vigorous PA and decrease their SB than mothers in the MB group. However, exercise adherence decreased considerably in all groups. Completeness, fidelity, and enjoyment were higher among the NMB group compared to the MB group.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The present results showed that mothers without musical background were more interested in movement-to-music exercises, as well as their children. For further studies it would be important to evaluate an effect of children’s own music-based activities on their SB and PA.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195837</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524073508287</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b0cb7b93</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pipsa P.

The study aimed to compare the chronic eccentric-overload training effects of unilateral (lateral lunge) vs bilateral (half-squat) using an inertial device, on hypertrophy and physical performance. Twenty-seven young team sports male players performed a 4 sets of 7 repetitions of inertial eccentric overload training, biweekly for 6 weeks, distributed in unilateral lunge group (UG: age: 22.8 ± 2.9 years; body mass: 75.3 ± 8.8 kg; height: 177.3 ± 3.7 cm) and bilateral squat group (BG: age: 22.6 ± 2.7 years; body mass: 79.5 ± 12.8 kg; height: 164.2 ± 7 cm). Lower limb muscle volume, counter movement jump (CMJ), power with both (POWER), dominant (POWERd) and no-dominant leg (POWERnd), change of direction turn of 90° with dominant (COD90d) and no-dominant leg (COD90nd) and 180° (COD180d and COD180nd), and 10m sprint time (T-10m) were measured pre and post-intervention. The UG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;adductor major&lt;/i&gt; (+11.1%) and &lt;i&gt;vastus medialis&lt;/i&gt; (+12.6%) higher than BG. The BG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;vastus lateralis&lt;/i&gt; (+9.9%) and &lt;i&gt;lateral gastrocnemius&lt;/i&gt; (+9.1%) higher than UG. Both groups improved CMJ, POWER, POWERd, POWERnd, COD90 and DEC-COD90, without changes in T-10m. The UG decrease DEC-COD90nd (-21.1%) and BG increase POWER (+38.6%) substantially more than the other group. Six-weeks of unilateral / bilateral EO training induce substantial improvements in lower limbs muscle volume and functional performance, although unilateral training seems to be more effective in improving COD90 performance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193841</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>89b168dc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Francisco Javier Núñez, Alfredo Santalla, Irene Carrasquila, Jose Antonio Asian, Jose Ignacio Reina, Luis Jesús Suarez-Arrones&lt;/p&gt;

Anti-predator signaling is highly variable with numerous examples of species employing cryptic coloration to avoid detection or conspicuous coloration (often coupled with a secondary defense) to ensure detection and recollection. While the ends of this spectrum are clear in their function, how species use intermediate signals is less clear. Australian Brood Frogs (&lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt;) display conspicuous coloration on both their dorsum and venter. Coupled with the alkaloid toxins these frogs possess, this coloration may be aposematic, providing a protective warning signal to predators. We assessed predation rates of known and novel color patterns and found no difference for avian or mammalian predators. However, when &lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt; dorsal phenotypes were collectively compared to the high-contrast ventral phenotype of this genus, we found birds, but not mammals, attacked dorsal phenotypes significantly less frequently than the ventral phenotype.

Background &lt;p&gt;Pro-active case detection (Pro-ACD), in the form of voluntary screening and treatment (VSAT) following community mobilisation about ‘asymptomatic malaria’, is currently being evaluated as a tool for &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; elimination in Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A qualitative study was conducted to explore community understanding, perceptions, expectations and acceptability of the Pro-ACD intervention in order to identify aspects that could be improved in future Pro-ACD activities. This was ancillary to a three-round VSAT campaign, carried out in three villages between December 2015 and March 2016. Qualitative data collection began shortly after the end of the three rounds of screening. Purposive sampling was used to select participants. Nine focus group discussions with participants (n = 46) and non-participants (n = 40) in the Pro-ACD screening were conducted, in addition to in-depth interviews with key village figures (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Health promotion messages were well delivered and received, but it was difficult for many villagers to understand the messages around ‘asymptomatic malaria’. Overall, villagers and village leaders had a positive opinion about the VSAT intervention. Acceptability was high, as a direct consequence of favourable perceptions towards the screening activity: the Pro-ACD intervention was seen by the local population as an effective, inexpensive, reliable and readily available tool to protect individuals and the community from the insurgence of malaria. Physical absence and lack of time (both linked to work-related activities) were the main reasons for non-participation.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although VSAT was generally well perceived and accepted, the ‘time factor’ related to the need to satisfy essential daily subsistence requirements played a significant role in determining participation in the screening. More well-adapted and meaningful Pro-ACD approaches could be implemented by improving the timing of the testing activites, and strengthening community participation and engagement to increase acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195809</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>89db08b6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pierluigi Taffon, Gabriele Rossi, Jean-Marie Kindermans, Rafael Van den Bergh, Chea Nguon, Mark Debackere, Lieven Vernaeve, Martin De Smet, Emilie Venables&lt;/p&gt;

However, existing approaches require a large number of plasma samples from healthy individuals, sequenced using the same platform and protocols to act as a reference panel. Obtaining this reference panel can be challenging, prohibitively expensive and limits the ability to migrate to improved sequencing platforms and improved protocols. Methods: We developed qCNV and sCNA-seq, two distinct tools that together provide a new approach for profiling somatic copy number alterations (sCNA) through the analysis of cell free DNA (cfDNA) without a reference panel. Our approach was designed to identify sCNA from cfDNA through the analysis of a single plasma sample and a matched normal DNA sample - both of which can be obtained from the same blood draw. qCNV is an efficient method for extracting read-depth from BAM files and sCNA-seq is a method that uses a probabilistic model of read depth to infer the copy number segmentation of the tumour. We compared the results from our pipeline to the established copy number profile of a cell-line, as well as the results from the plasma-Seq analysis of cfDNA-like mixtures and real, clinical data-sets. Results: With a single, unmatched, germline reference sample, our pipeline recapitulated the known copy number profile of a cell-line and demonstrated similar results to those obtained from plasma-Seq. With less than 1X genome coverage, our approach identified clinically relevant sCNA in samples with as little as 20 % tumour DNA. When applied to plasma samples from cancer patients, our pipeline identified clinically significant mutations. Conclusions: These results show it is possible to identify therapeutically-relevant copy number mutations from plasma samples without the need to generate a reference panel from a large number of healthy individuals. Together with the range of sequencing platforms supported by our qCNV+sCNA-Seq pipeline, as well as the Galaxy implementation of this solution, this pipeline makes cfDNA profiling more accessible and makes it easier to identify sCNA from the plasma of cancer patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/28/290171</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522264512936</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e3ca74a3</fingerprint><description>Background: The accurate detection of copy number alterations from the analysis of circulating cell free tumour DNA (ctDNA) in blood is essential to realising the potential of liquid biopsies.

Conclusions: These results show it is possible to identify therapeutically-relevant copy number mutations from plasma samples without the need to generate a reference panel from a large number of healthy individuals. Together with the range of sequencing platforms supported by our qCNV+sCNA-Seq pipeline, as well as the Galaxy implementation of this solution, this pipeline makes cfDNA profiling more accessible and makes it easier to identify sCNA from the plasma of cancer patients.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/290171v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Robertson, A.</name></author><title>Profiling copy number alterations in cell-free tumour DNA using a single-reference [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1626e0919a8:6bff896:34f43e70</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/290171v1?rss=1</link><published>1522220400000</published></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4006.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Many practicing biologists accept that nothing in their discipline makes sense except in the light of evolution, and that natural selection is evolution’s principal sense-maker.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to assess the association between perceived social support and induced abortion among young women in Lima, Peru. In addition, prevalence and incidence of induced abortion was estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study enrolling women aged 18–25 years from maternal health centers in Southern Lima, Peru, was conducted. Induced abortion was defined as the difference between the total number of pregnancies ended in abortion and the number of spontaneous abortions; whereas perceived social support was assessed using the DUKE-UNC scale. Prevalence and incidence of induced abortion (per 100 person-years risk) was estimated, and the association of interest was evaluated using Poisson regression models with robust variance. A total of 298 women were enrolled, mean age 21.7 (± 2.2) years. Low levels of social support were found in 43.6% (95%CI 38.0%–49.3%), and 17.4% (95%CI: 13.1%– 21.8%) women reported at least one induced abortion. The incidence of induced abortion was 2.37 (95%CI: 1.81–3.11) per 100 person-years risk. The multivariable model showed evidence of the association between low perceived social support and induced abortion (RR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.14–3.30) after controlling for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was evidence of an association between low perceived social support and induced abortion among women aged 18 to 25 years. Incidence of induced abortion was similar or even greater than rates of countries where abortion is legal. Strategies to increase social support and reduce induced abortion rates are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192764</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1c859bfd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Luis E.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is state of the art in molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this context, maintenance of assay fidelity and detection of technical inaccuracy are crucial. Beside multiple common negative controls for the clinical sample preparations, quality control charts (QCC) are a common validation tool to sustain high process quality by continuously recording of qRT-PCR control parameters. Here, we report on establishment and benefit of QCC in qRT-PCR-based CML diagnostics. The absolute quantification of &lt;i&gt;BCR-ABL1&lt;/i&gt; fusion transcripts in patient samples is based on coamplification of a serially diluted reference plasmid (pME-2). For QCC establishment the measured Ct values of each pME-2 standard dilution (4–400,000) of a test set resembling 21 sequential qRT-PCR experiments were recorded and statistically evaluated. Test set data were used for determination of warning limits (mean +/- 2-fold standard deviation) and control (intervention) limits (mean +/- 3-fold standard deviation) to allow rapid detection of defined out-of-control situations which may require intervention. We have retrospectively analyzed QCC data of 282 sequential qRT-PCR experiments (564 reactions). Data evaluation using QCCs revealed three out-of-control situations that required intervention like experiment repeats, renewal of pME-2 standards, replacement of reagents or personnel re-training. In conclusion, with minimal more effort and hands-on time QCC rank among the best tools to grant high quality and reproducibility in CML routine molecular diagnosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196326</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c365b4df</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Birgit Spiess, Nicole Naumann, Norbert Galuschek, Sébastien Rinaldetti, Ute Kossak-Roth, Irina Tarnopolscaia, Elena Felde, Alice Fabarius, Wolf-Karsten Hofmann, Susanne Saußele, Wolfgang Seifarth&lt;/p&gt;

Humans are remarkably adept at generalizing knowledge between experiences in a way that can be difficult for computers. Often, this entails generalizing constituent pieces of experiences that do not fully overlap, but nonetheless share useful similarities with, previously acquired knowledge. However, it is often unclear how knowledge gained in one context should generalize to another. Previous computational models and data suggest that rather than learning about each individual context, humans build latent abstract structures and learn to link these structures to arbitrary contexts, facilitating generalization. In these models, task structures that are more popular across contexts are more likely to be revisited in new contexts. However, these models can only re-use policies as a whole and are unable to transfer knowledge about the transition structure of the environment even if only the goal has changed (or vice-versa). This contrasts with ecological settings, where some aspects of task structure, such as the transition function, will be shared between context separately from other aspects, such as the reward function. Here, we develop a novel non-parametric Bayesian agent that forms independent latent clusters for transition and reward functions, affording separable transfer of their constituent parts across contexts. We show that the relative performance of this agent compared to an agent that jointly clusters reward and transition functions depends environmental task statistics: the mutual information between transition and reward functions and the stochasticity of the observations. We formalize our analysis through an information theoretic account of the priors, and propose a meta learning agent that dynamically arbitrates between strategies across task domains to optimize a statistical tradeoff.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X_ZyVI2ySQ4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas T.

These results show how functional and topological characteristics of metabolic pathways contribute to shape the patterns of evolutionary pressures driven by natural selection and how pathway network structure matters in the evolutionary process that shapes the evolution of the system.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292714v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Montanucci, L.</name></author><title>Influence of pathway topology and functional class on the molecular evolution of human metabolic genes [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162964c6b49:a54d05e:9f3b30f2</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292714v1?rss=1</link><published>1522911600000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23767-8</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source reconstruction of airborne toxics based on acute health effects information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source reconstruction of airborne toxics based on acute health effects information, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23767-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23767-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Source reconstruction of airborne toxics based on acute health effects information&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-daSxDvMY_I&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source reconstruction of airborne toxics based on acute health effects information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source reconstruction of airborne toxics based on acute health effects information, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23767-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23767-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Source reconstruction of airborne toxics based on acute health effects information&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-daSxDvMY_I&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>682</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23767-8/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23767_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width></visual><crawled>1522833366950</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2193ed4a</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23767-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/-daSxDvMY_I/s41598-018-23767-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Christos D.

Reactive electrophile species (RES), including prostaglandins, phytoprostanes and 12-oxo phytodienoic acid (OPDA), activate detoxification responses in plants and animals.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. An important step in the shift to a pro-cancerous microenvironment is the transformation of normal stromal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are present in a majority of solid tumors and can directly promote tumor cell motility via cytokine, chemokine and growth factor secretion into the TME. The exact effects that the TME has upon cytoskeletal regulation in motile tumor cells remain enigmatic. The conserved formin family of cytoskeleton regulating proteins plays an essential role in the assembly and/or bundling of unbranched actin filaments. Mammalian Diaphanous-related formin 2 (mDia2/DIAPH3/Drf3/Dia) assembles a dynamic F-actin cytoskeleton that underlies tumor cell migration and invasion. We therefore sought to understand whether CAF-derived chemokines impact breast tumor cell motility through modification of the formin-assembled F-actin cytoskeleton. In MDA-MB-231 cells, conditioned media (CM) from WS19T CAFs, a human breast tumor-adjacent CAF line, significantly and robustly increased wound closure and invasion relative to normal human mammary fibroblast (HMF)-CM. WS19T-CM also promoted proteasome-mediated mDia2 degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells relative to control HMF-CM and WS21T CAF-CM, a breast CAF cell line that failed to promote robust MDA-MB-231 migration. Cytokine array analysis of CM identified up-regulated secreted factors in WS19T relative to control WS21T CM. We identified CXCL12 as a CM factor influencing loss of mDia2 protein while increasing MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Our data suggest a mechanism whereby CAFs promote tumor cell migration and invasion through CXCL12 secretion to regulate the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton in breast tumor cells.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195278</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8ed0de76</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kaitlyn M.

addiction is a global health problem that causes substantial damage to the
health of addicted individuals around the world. Dopamine synthesizing neurons
in the brain play a vital role in the addiction to cocaine. But the underlying
molecular mechanisms that help cocaine exert its addictive effect have not been
very well understood. Bioinformatics can be a useful tool in the attempt to
broaden our understanding in this area. In the present study, Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was carried out on the upregulated genes from a
dataset of Dopamine synthesizing neurons of post-mortem human brain of cocaine

addiction is a global health problem that causes substantial damage to the
health of addicted individuals around the world. Dopamine synthesizing neurons
in the brain play a vital role in the addiction to cocaine. But the underlying
molecular mechanisms that help cocaine exert its addictive effect have not been
very well understood. Bioinformatics can be a useful tool in the attempt to
broaden our understanding in this area. In the present study, Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was carried out on the upregulated genes from a
dataset of Dopamine synthesizing neurons of post-mortem human brain of cocaine
addicts. As a result of this analysis, 3 miRNAs have been identified as having
significant influence on transcription of the upregulated genes. These 3 miRNAs
hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of cocaine addiction.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25198?af=R</originId><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1522925554799</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d6818eb8</fingerprint><description>The aim of this study was to determine whether the periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations can be used for accurate prediction of the influence of the increased pressure on crystal structure and stability of molecular solids.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;HIV-1 dual infection is a condition that results from infection with at least two HIV-1 variants from different sources. The scarceness of information on this condition is partly due to the fact that its detection is technically challenging. Using next-generation sequencing we defined the extent of HIV-1 dual infection in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM).&lt;/p&gt; Material &amp;amp; methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-six MSM, diagnosed with HIV-1 subtype B infection between 2008 and 2013 were selected for next-generation sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;envelope&lt;/i&gt; V3. Sequencing was performed on 2 plasma samples collected with an interval of &gt; 6 months before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inspected for dual infection, defined as the presence of two or more monophyletic clusters with ≥ 90% bootstrap support and a mean between-cluster genetic distance of ≥ 10%. To confirm dual infection, deep V3 sequencing of intermediate samples was performed as well as clonal sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;protease-reverse transcriptase&lt;/i&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five of the 74 patients (6.8%) for whom deep sequencing was successful, showed clear evidence of dual infection. In 4 of them, the second strain was absent in the first sample but occurred in subsequent samples. This was highly suggestive for superinfection.

This prevalence is probably an underestimation, because stringent criteria were used to classify viral variants as originating from a new infection event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195679</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Laura Hebberecht</name></author><title>Frequency of occurrence of HIV-1 dual infection in a Belgian MSM population</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523048400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd088:7c9981b6</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195679</link><published>1523048400000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24097-5</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: The Incipient Motion Features of Sediment from Yangtze Estuary: Annular Flume Experiments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: The Incipient Motion Features of Sediment from Yangtze Estuary: Annular Flume Experiments, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24097-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24097-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: The Incipient Motion Features of Sediment from Yangtze Estuary: Annular Flume Experiments&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/DdKy0F1CYL4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: The Incipient Motion Features of Sediment from Yangtze Estuary: Annular Flume Experiments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: The Incipient Motion Features of Sediment from Yangtze Estuary: Annular Flume Experiments, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24097-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24097-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: The Incipient Motion Features of Sediment from Yangtze Estuary: Annular Flume Experiments&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/DdKy0F1CYL4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523485220395</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>30fa7d29</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24097-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/DdKy0F1CYL4/s41598-018-24097-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Huang Wei</name></author><title>Author Correction: The Incipient Motion Features of Sediment from Yangtze Estuary: Annular Flume Experiments</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b6cb9e2b:918ca1:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24097-5</link><published>1523516400000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195283</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Esmaeil Amiri, Per Kryger, Marina D.

Deformed wing virus (DWV) is an important pathogen in a broad range of insects, including honey bees. Concordant with the spread of &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt;, DWV is present in the majority of honey bee colonies and can result in either low-level infections with asymptomatic bees that nonetheless exhibit increased colony loss under stress, or high-level infections with acute effects on bee health and viability. DWV can be transmitted vertically or horizontally and evidence suggests that horizontal transmission via &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt; is associated with acute symptomatic infections. Vertical transmission also occurs and is presumably important for the maintenance of DWV in honey bee populations. To further our understanding the vertical transmission of DWV through queens, we performed three experiments: we studied the quantitative effectiveness of vertical transmission, surveyed the prevalence of successful egg infection under commercial conditions, and distinguished among three possible mechanisms of transmission. We find that queen-infection level predicts the DWV titers in their eggs, although the transmission is not very efficient. Our quantitative assessment of DWV demonstrates that eggs in 1/3 of the colonies are infected with DWV and highly infected eggs are rare in newly-installed spring colonies. Additionally, our results indicate that DWV transmission occurs predominantly by virus adhering to the surface of eggs (transovum) rather than intracellularly. Our combined results suggest that the queens’ DWV vectoring capacity in practice is not as high as its theoretical potential. Thus, DWV transmission by honey bee queens is part of the DWV epidemic with relevant practical implications, which should be further studied.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195283</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>94a2f6db</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Esmaeil Amiri, Per Kryger, Marina D.

The best predictor of IA was AspICU algorithm (AUC, 1) followed by serum galactomannan antigen (GM) cut-off (≥1.24) calculated based on AspICU algorithm (AUC, 0.822).

South Africa has a Universal Test and Treat (UTT) policy in place to ensure that everyone tests for HIV and can access treatment if they test positive. The aim of this study is to document the pathways that older South Africans who are living with HIV take to access testing and treatment in this context. Despite the aging of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and clear evidence that testing older persons (over age 50) is necessary, very little is known about the circumstances under which older persons test for HIV or their motivations for doing so. In this study, we analyze 21 qualitative, in-depth interviews with women and men aged 50 and over who are living with HIV from two townships outside of Cape Town. Using grounded theory to specify emerging themes, we find similarities and differences between older men and women in their pathways to testing. Men primarily test for HIV when their spouse is diagnosed or in connection with TB testing and treatment. Older women, who are more likely to be widowed or divorced, often test for HIV only when they are symptomatic or not responding appropriately to care for non-communicable diseases. Most importantly, we find that older South Africans do not seek testing as a response to risk. Instead, older men and women test only once they are symptomatic and referred by a provider, or as a result of a partner’s status. Our respondents, particularly the women, expressed “shock” and confusion at learning they were HIV-positive because they do not see themselves as at risk of acquiring HIV. Because the benefits of UTT are greatest with early detection and treatment, older persons’ tendency to test at such a late stage of illness decreases the individual and population level advantages of UTT. More research is needed to understand older persons’ risk and testing behavior so that policy and programs include HIV testing messages that reach this population.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196158</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4cb79259</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enid Schatz, Lucia Knight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; is a protozoon parasite that causes congenital toxoplasmosis, as well as other serious clinical presentations, in immune compromised humans. Analyses of the prevalence and genotyping of strains from the definitive host and intermediate hosts will help to understanding the circulation of the different strains and elucidating the role of the genotype(s) in human toxoplasmosis. Turkey has a specific geographic location bridging Africa, Europe, and Asia. We hypothesized that &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains may have been transferred to Turkey from these continents via migratory birds or vice versa. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in wild birds of prey of İzmir and Manisa provinces as well as genetically characterize &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains from these wild birds to show the relation between bird strains and neighboring stray cats as well as human strains previously isolated in Turkey. Tissues obtained from 48 wild birds were investigated for the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA and then bioassayed in mouse. Isolated strains were genotyped using 15 microsatellite markers. The prevalence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA was found to be 89.6% (n: 43/48) in wild birds. Out of 43 positive samples, a total of 14 strains were genotyped by 15 microsatellite markers. Among them, eight were type II, three were type III and three were mixture of genotypes (two type II/II and one was II/III). These are the first data that showed the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; and types II and III genotypes in wild birds of Turkey. Moreover, Africa 1 was not detected. In addition, cluster analysis showed that &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains within type II and III lineage have close relation with strains previously isolated from stray cats in İzmir. Further studies are required to isolate more strains from human cases, other intermediate hosts, and water sources to reveal this relation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196159</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524074227579</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>cb4ccfc2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammet Karakavuk, Duygu Aldemir, Aurélien Mercier, Esra Atalay Şahar, Hüseyin Can, Jean-Benjamin Murat, Ömer Döndüren, Şengül Can, Hüseyin Gökhan Özdemir, Aysu Değirmenci Döşkaya, Bayram Pektaş, Marie-Laure Dardé, Adnan Yüksel Gürüz, Mert Döşkaya&lt;/p&gt;

The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in wild birds of prey of İzmir and Manisa provinces as well as genetically characterize &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains from these wild birds to show the relation between bird strains and neighboring stray cats as well as human strains previously isolated in Turkey. Tissues obtained from 48 wild birds were investigated for the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA and then bioassayed in mouse. Isolated strains were genotyped using 15 microsatellite markers. The prevalence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA was found to be 89.6% (n: 43/48) in wild birds. Out of 43 positive samples, a total of 14 strains were genotyped by 15 microsatellite markers. Among them, eight were type II, three were type III and three were mixture of genotypes (two type II/II and one was II/III). These are the first data that showed the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; and types II and III genotypes in wild birds of Turkey. Moreover, Africa 1 was not detected. In addition, cluster analysis showed that &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains within type II and III lineage have close relation with strains previously isolated from stray cats in İzmir. Further studies are required to isolate more strains from human cases, other intermediate hosts, and water sources to reveal this relation.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196159</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Muhammet Karakavuk</name></author><title>Prevalence of toxoplasmosis and genetic characterization of &amp;lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&amp;lt;/i&gt; strains isolated in wild birds of prey and their relation with previously isolated strains from Turkey</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524085200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe37:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196159</link><published>1524085200000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03924-9</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecology’s remote-sensing revolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecology’s remote-sensing revolution, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03924-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03924-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Satellite data, and the tools that ecologists use to analyse them, are more accessible and plentiful than ever.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03924-9/d41586-018-03924-9_15578108.jpg</url><width>1024</width></visual><crawled>1522784608098</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>19e1bea</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecology’s remote-sensing revolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecology’s remote-sensing revolution, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03924-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03924-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Satellite data, and the tools that ecologists use to analyse them, are more accessible and plentiful than ever.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03924-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Roberta Kwok</name></author><title>Ecology’s remote-sensing revolution</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>132</engagement><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1628d091f62:95ea4d8:34f43e70</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03924-9</link><published>1522738800000</published></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25165?af=R</originId><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1522119010699</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ea68e52d</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25165?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>False</unread><published>1522119010699</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162655ce98b:6ce09:76251cdd</id><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25165?af=R</link><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195071</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Meng-Ruey Wu, Chia-Ying Hsiao, Chun-Han Cheng, Feng-Ching Liao, Chuan-Lei Chao, Chun-Yen Chen, Hung-I Yeh, Min-I Su&lt;/p&gt;
Introduction &lt;p&gt;Paraquat poisoning can result in dysfunction of multiple organs, and pulmonary fibrosis with respiratory failure is the major cause of mortality. For terminally ill patients, some life-prolonging treatments can be non-beneficial treatments (NBT). The objective of this study was to determine if intubation is a NBT for patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study included 68 patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning. Patients were hospitalized at MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taitung Branch, Taiwan, between 2005 to April 2016. Composite outcomes of intra-hospital mortality, the rate of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, prescribed medications, length of stay, and medical costs were recorded and compared between the do-not-intubate (DNI) group and endotracheal intubation (EI) group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Intra-hospital mortality rate for the entire population was 100%. There were significantly more patients with DNR orders in the DNI group (P = 0.007). There were no differences in the length of hospital stay. However, patients in DNI group had significantly less vasopressor use and more morphine use, shorter time in the intensive care unit, and fewer medical costs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The procedure of intubation in patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning can be considered inappropriate life-prolonging treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195071</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>52e34a5f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Meng-Ruey Wu, Chia-Ying Hsiao, Chun-Han Cheng, Feng-Ching Liao, Chuan-Lei Chao, Chun-Yen Chen, Hung-I Yeh, Min-I Su&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Acute gastroenteritis illness is a common illness that causes considerable morbidity, but current estimates of the cost to the Australian healthcare system are unknown.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the current healthcare utilisation and direct public healthcare system costs attributable to acute gastroenteritis illness in Australia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is an incidence-based cost-of-illness study focused on quantifying direct health care costs using a bottom-up approach. Data on general practitioner consultations, prescribed medications, diagnostic tests, specialist consultations, emergency department visits and hospital admissions were collected from national reports.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using 2016 prices, the estimated annual direct per capita cost of acute gastroenteritis illness was AUD$14.87 (USD$10.71), equating to AUD$20.27 (USD$14.59) per case. The estimated overall economic burden in Australia was AUD$359 million (USD$258 million; AUD$1.5 million per 100,000 people). The major contributors to this cost were hospital admissions (57.1%), emergency department visits (17.7%), and general practitioner consultations (14.0%). Children under five years of age have the highest per capita rates of acute gastroenteritis illness; however, service utilisation rates vary by age group and both young children and older adults accounted for a substantial proportion of the overall economic burden attributable to acute gastroenteritis illness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although chronic diseases comprise a large cost burden on the healthcare system, acute illnesses, including acute gastroenteritis illness, also impose substantial direct healthcare system costs. Providing data on current cost estimates is useful for prioritizing public health interventions, with our findings suggesting that it would be ideal if targeted interventions to reduce hospitalisation rates among young children and older adults were available.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195759</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2ab4cff</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by S.

Two plasma devices at atmospheric pressure (air dielectric barrier discharge and helium plasma jet) have been used to study the early germination of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; seeds during the first days. Then, plasma activated waters are used during the later stage of plant development and growth until 42 days. The effects on both testa and endospserm ruptures during the germination stage are significant in the case of air plasma due to its higher energy and efficiency of producing reactive oxygen species than the case of helium plasma. The latter has shown distinct effects only for testa rupture. Analysis of germination stimulations are based on specific stainings for reactive oxygen species production, peroxidase activity and also membrane permeability tests. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown a smoother seed surface for air plasma treated seeds that can explain the plasma induced-germination. During the growth stage, plants were watered using 4 kinds of water (tap and deionized waters activated or not by the low temperature plasma jet). With regards to other water kinds, the characterization of the tap water has shown a larger conductivity, acidity and concentration of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Only the tap water activated by the plasma jet has shown a significant effect on the plant growth. This effect could be correlated to reactive nitrogen species such as nitrite/nitrate species present in plasma activated tap water.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195512</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fa5a3ed9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maxime Bafoil, Achraf Jemmat, Yves Martinez, Nofel Merbahi, Olivier Eichwald, Christophe Dunand, Mohammed Yousfi&lt;/p&gt;

Variation in cortical connectivity profiles is typically modeled as having a coarse spatial scale parcellated into interconnected brain areas. We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PKWzqyJ_2Tk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Variation in cortical connectivity profiles is typically modeled as having a coarse spatial scale parcellated into interconnected brain areas. We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure.

The present study aimed to explore how state self-control influences the intertemporal decisions made by individuals with high and low trait self-control. State self-control, represented by the degree of depletion, was manipulated by conducting Stroop tasks with different levels of difficulty, and the intertemporal decision task was used as a self-control task. Compared with participants with high trait self-control, the preferences of participants with low trait self-control for immediate rewards were more vulnerable to the difficulty of depletion tasks. Throughout the experimental stages, the heart rate variability (HRV) of participants with high trait self-control was significantly higher than that of participants with low trait self-control, indicating that individuals with high trait self-control may have stronger and more stable self-control abilities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195333</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a0e64413</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Guan, Jiamei He&lt;/p&gt;

The transfer of seaweeds from subtidal bottoms to nearby intertidal rocky shores is a common but often overlooked phenomenon. Freshly detached seaweeds often represent critical trophic subsidies for herbivores living in upper-shore rocky intertidal areas, such as the marine snail &lt;i&gt;Diloma nigerrima&lt;/i&gt;. This species relies on three species of seaweeds for food and displays feeding strategies to deal with a resource that is scarce and at times unpredictable. This study focused on the nutritional quality of freshly detached algae (&lt;i&gt;Durvillaea antarctica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lessonia spicata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lessonia trabeculata&lt;/i&gt;) and measured &lt;i&gt;Diloma nigerrima&lt;/i&gt;’s algal consumption rates in trials with and without choice. Absorption efficiency and growth of individual snails fed on each alga were also measured. &lt;i&gt;Durvillaea antarctica&lt;/i&gt; had the highest nutritional quality and was the most consumed algae in both single and multiple-choice trials. Absorption efficiency was also highest for &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;antarctica&lt;/i&gt; but growth rates of snails fed with this species were similar to those fed with the other algae. Combined, these results suggest that &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigerrima&lt;/i&gt; has the ability to discriminate among seaweeds based on their nutritional quality. A potential increase in oxygen uptake when &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigerrima&lt;/i&gt; is consuming the preferred food item is also proposed as a plausible hypothesis to explain the mismatch between snails’ preference and growth rate. These results aim to guide further studies on trophic subsidies and their role in coastal systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196121</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>19ab5e97</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Quintanilla-Ahumada, Pedro A.

LdtR is a master regulator of gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Liberibacter asiaticus&lt;/i&gt;, one of the causative agents of citrus greening disease. LdtR belongs to the MarR-family of transcriptional regulators and it has been linked to the regulation of more than 180 genes in &lt;i&gt;Liberibacter&lt;/i&gt; species, most of them gathered in the following Clusters of Orthologous Groups: cell motility, cell wall envelope, energy production, and transcription. Our previous transcriptomic evidence suggested that LdtR is directly involved in the modulation of the zinc uptake system genes (&lt;i&gt;znu&lt;/i&gt;) in the closely related &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;crescens&lt;/i&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;In parturients with increased physiologically intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and a short stature, a greater cephalad spread of spinal anesthesia is often observed after a fixed amount of plain bupivacaine is administered. Therefore, we designed this prospective study to test whether IAP and vertebral column length (VCL) were predictors of spinal spread in parturients undergoing a cesarean section.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 113 parturients, all undergoing elective cesarean sections with single-shot spinal anesthesia, were enrolled. The L3-L4 interspace was entered, and 2 mL of 0.5% plain bupivacaine was injected into the subarachnoid space. Upon loss of temperature sensation at the T4 level, IAP was measured through a bladder catheter while the patient was in the supine position with a 10°left lateral tilt. Parturient demographic variables, including age, height, weight, IAP, and VCL were recorded. Linear regressions and multiple regressions were performed to analyze the relationships between parturient variables and the spread of spinal anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 109 parturients were included in the analysis. Linear regression analysis showed a significant univariate correlation of height, weight, body mass index (BMI), IAP, and VCL with cephalad spread (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt; 0.004). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that IAP and VCL were the key determinants of spinal spread (both &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), where as exclusion of age, weight, and height did not change the result (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt; 0.209).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our data indicated that IAP and VCL were significant predictors of intrathecal spread of plain bupivacaine, and there was a positive association between IAP and abdominal girth in term parturients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195137</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e2e14759</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ting-ting Ni, Ying Zhou, An-cui Yong, Lu Wang, Qing-he Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

The relapse of nasal deformity is a challenge for modern correction of cleft lip. A comprehensive understanding in the biomechanical perspective of both the formation and correction of the cleft lip nasal deformity would lead to improved stability of the corrective outcome. In this study, a finite element model of secondary cleft lip nasal deformity was constructed, on which two critical corrective maneuvers were mimicked in the form of force-loading. The intercrural suture was simulated by a force loaded at the intermediate crus of the alar cartilage directing anteriorly and medially, and the suture suspending the alar cartilage to the upper lateral cartilage was simulated by a force loaded at the lateral crus directing superiorly and medially. The equivalent von-mises stress and the total deformation consequent to different patterns of loading were captured. Our biomechanical analyses suggested that the intercrural suture at the nasal tip might be more effective in generating widespread morphological change than the suspension suture, but left much higher level of stress within the skin envelope if placed too high. Synergistic effect was observed between the two sutures in both the resultant deformation and stress. In addition, our simulations were partially supported by clinical photogrammetry data.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>940c8d61</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanyao Huang, Yeping Li, Xiangyou Luo, Xu Cheng, Bing Shi, Jingtao Li&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Salivary glands are known immune effector sites and considered to be part of the whole mucosal immune system. The aim of the present study was to assess the salivary immune response to rotavirus (RV) infection through the analysis of the cytokine immune profile in saliva.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;A prospective comparative study of serial saliva samples from 27 RV-infected patients (sampled upon admission to the hospital during acute phase and at convalescence—i.e. at least three months after recovery) and 36 healthy controls was performed. Concentrations of 11 salivary cytokines (IFN-γ, IFN-α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL12&lt;sub&gt;p70&lt;/sub&gt;, TNF-α, IFN-λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, IL-22) were determined. Cytokine levels were compared between healthy controls acute infection and convalescence. The correlation between clinical data and salivary cytokine profile in infected children was assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The salivary cytokine profile changes significantly in response to acute RV infection. In RV-infected patients, IL-22 levels were increased in the acute phase with respect to convalescence (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-value &amp;lt; 0.001). Comparisons between infected and control group showed significant differences in salivary IFN-α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-22. Although acute-phase levels of IL-12, IL-10, IL-6 and IFN-γ showed nominal association with Vesikari’s severity, this trend did not reach statistical significance after multiple test adjustment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RV infection induces a host salivary immune response, indicating that immune mucosal response to RV infection is not confined to the intestinal mucosa. Our data point to a whole mucosal implication in the RV infection as a result of the integrative mucosal immune response, and suggest the salivary gland as effector site for RV infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195314</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c984e6fb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by José Gómez-Rial, María José Curras-Tuala, Irene Rivero-Calle, Carmen Rodríguez-Tenreiro, Lorenzo Redondo-Collazo, Alberto Gómez-Carballa, Jacobo Pardo-Seco, Antonio Salas, Federico Martinón-Torres&lt;/p&gt;

The enigmatic introns of ribosomal proteins may prove to be a novel and vital link in this regulatory balancing act.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289751v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Pande, A.</name></author><title>Intronic non-coding RNAs within ribosomal protein coding genes can regulate biogenesis of yeast ribosome [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162692d65db:655dffe:9f3b30f2</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289751v1?rss=1</link><published>1522134000000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04556-9</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When feathers flew at a natural-history archive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When feathers flew at a natural-history archive, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04556-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04556-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stuart Pimm on the tragic tale of a hobbyist, a heist and a great scientific legacy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04556-9/d41586-018-04556-9_15632968.jpg</url><width>1024</width></visual><crawled>1523966659180</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fb44711b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When feathers flew at a natural-history archive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When feathers flew at a natural-history archive, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04556-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04556-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stuart Pimm on the tragic tale of a hobbyist, a heist and a great scientific legacy.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04556-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Stuart Pimm</name></author><title>When feathers flew at a natural-history archive</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>109</engagement><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162d37dca6c:315ff4d:34f43e70</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04556-9</link><published>1523948400000</published></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/204?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Complex interactions between host immunity and the microbiome regulate norovirus infection.

The development of models of macromolecular electrostatics capable of delivering improved fidelity to quantum mechanical calculations is an active field of research in computational chemistry. Most molecular force field development takes place in the context of models with full Cartesian coordinate degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, a number of macromolecular modeling programs use a reduced set of conformational variables limited to rotatable bonds. Efficient algorithms for minimizing the energies of macromolecular systems with torsional degrees of freedom have been developed with the assumption that all atom-atom interaction potentials are isotropic. We describe novel modifications to address the anisotropy of higher order multipole terms while retaining the efficiency of these approaches. In addition, we present a treatment for obtaining derivatives of atom-centered tensors with respect to torsional degrees of freedom. We apply these results to enable minimization of the Amoeba multipole electrostatics potential in a system with torsional degrees of freedom, and validate the correctness of the gradients by comparison to finite difference approximations. In the interest of enabling a complete model of electrostatics with implicit treatment of solvent-mediated effects, we also derive expressions for the derivative of solvent accessible surface area with respect to torsional degrees of freedom.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195578</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1535c7db</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas K.

Bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) is one experimental model of vascular dementia thought to preferentially impact brain white matter. Indeed, few studies report hippocampal and cortical pathology prior to 30 days post-stenosis; though it is unclear whether those studies examined regions outside the white matter. Since changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability precede more overt brain pathology in various diseases, we hypothesized that changes within the BBB and/or BBB-associated extracellular matrix (ECM) could occur earlier after BCAS in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum and be a precursor of longer term pathology. Here, C57Bl/6 mice underwent BCAS or sham surgeries and changes in the BBB and ECM were analyzed by collagen IV (vascular basement membrane component), α5 integrin (marker of endothelial activation), claudin-5 and occludin (tight junction proteins), Evans blue (permeability marker), Ki-67 (cell proliferation marker), and GFAP and CD11b (glial cell markers) immunohistochemistry after 14 days. Significant changes in markers of cerebrovascular integrity and glial activation were detected, not only in the striatum, but also in the hippocampus and cortex. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that changes in the BBB/ECM occur shortly after BCAS and within multiple brain regions and suggests such changes might underlie the gradual development of BCAS non-white matter pathology.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195765</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a5fc01f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jill M.

Numerous factors affect how people choose a fine dining restaurant, including food quality, service quality, food safety, and hedonic value. A conceptual framework for evaluating restaurant selection behavior has not yet been developed. This study surveyed 150 individuals with fine dining experience and proposed the use of mental accounting and axiomatic design to construct a consumer economic behavior model. Linear and logistic regressions were employed to determine model correlations and the probability of each factor affecting behavior. The most crucial factor was food quality, followed by service and dining motivation, particularly regarding family dining. Safe ingredients, high cooking standards, and menu innovation all increased the likelihood of consumers choosing fine dining restaurants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194886</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>773d0fd3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sheng-Hsun Hsu, Cheng-Fu Hsiao, Sang-Bing Tsai&lt;/p&gt;

Herein, we extend this approach to estimate evolutionary distances between species based on their complete or incomplete proteomes; our implementation is called Prot-SpaM. We show that Prot-SpaM can accurately estimate phylogenetic distances, and that our program can be used to calculate phylogenetic trees from whole proteomes in a matter of seconds. For various groups of taxa, we show that trees calculated with Prot-SpaM are of high quality. The source code of our software is available through Github: https://github.com/jschellh/ProtSpaM</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/306142v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Leimeister, C.-A.</name></author><title>Prot-SpaM: Fast alignment-free phylogeny reconstruction based on whole-proteome sequences [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162f402fab0:615b9f2:34f43e70</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/306142v1?rss=1</link><published>1524466800000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195300</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yu-Hung Lai, Hsiu-Lin Chen, San-Nan Yang, Shun-Jen Chang, Lea-Yea Chuang, Wen-Chuan Wu&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;The etiology of transient corneal haze in premature infants is not known and how it relates to clinical outcomes in premature infants is not clear.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To study associated factors of transient corneal haze in premature infants.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a retrospective study of 261 premature infants from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening in the neonatal intensive care unit at a tertiary referral hospital. Characteristics of premature infants with and without corneal haze were analyzed by correlation tests, Chi-square tests, and logistic regressions were used for statistical analyses. Associations between corneal haze and birth weight (BW), gestational age at birth (GA), central corneal thickness, intraocular pressure, and other systemic and ophthalmic data were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The incidence of corneal haze was 13.4%. Lower BW, lower GA, packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion, more days on oxygen, older maternal age, bronchopulmonary disease, and stage 3 ROP are associated with corneal haze. The severity of corneal haze decreased with infants’ postmenstrual age. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that BW and maternal age are the most important predictors of corneal haze.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Low BW and older maternal age are the most important predictors of corneal haze in premature infants. Premature infants with corneal haze could carry more systemic and ocular morbidities. Hence they may require more clinical attention. Corneal haze is unlikely to hinder the treatment of ROP. However, it is possible that corneal haze could hinder the examination of ROP in some infants. If corneal haze does interfere with ROP screening, a closer, more conservative follow-up schedule with a senior ophthalmologist experienced in managing ROP is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195300</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>934468ef</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu-Hung Lai, Hsiu-Lin Chen, San-Nan Yang, Shun-Jen Chang, Lea-Yea Chuang, Wen-Chuan Wu&lt;/p&gt;

Sea turtles are distributed in tropical and subtropical seas worldwide. They play several ecological roles and are considered important indicators of the health of marine ecosystems. Studying epibiotic diatoms living on turtle shells suggestively has great potential in the study of turtle behavior because diatoms are always there. However, diatom identification at the species level is time consuming, requires well-trained specialists, and there is a high probability of finding new taxa growing on turtle shells, which makes identification tricky. An alternative approach based on DNA barcoding and high throughput sequencing (HTS), metabarcoding, has been developed in recent years to identify species at the community level by using a DNA reference library. The suitabilities of morphological and molecular approaches were compared. Diatom assemblages were sampled from seven juvenile green turtles (&lt;i&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/i&gt;) from Mayotte Island, France. The structures of the epibiotic diatom assemblages differed between both approaches. This resulted in different clustering of the turtles based on their diatom communities. Metabarcoding allowed better discrimination between turtles based on their epibiotic diatom assemblages and put into evidence the presence of a cryptic diatom diversity. Microscopy, for its part, provided more ecological information of sea turtles based on historical bibliographical data and the abundances of ecological guilds of the diatom species present in the samples. This study shows the complementary nature of these two methods for studying turtle behavior.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195770</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5f2ddbf7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sinziana F.

The current push for rigor and reproducibility is driven by a desire for confidence in research results. Here, we suggest a framework for a systematic process, based on consensus principles of measurement science, to guide researchers and reviewers in assessing, documenting, and mitigating the sources of uncertainty in a study. All study results have associated ambiguities that are not always clarified by simply establishing reproducibility. By explicitly considering sources of uncertainty, noting aspects of the experimental system that are difficult to characterize quantitatively, and proposing alternative interpretations, the researcher provides information that enhances comparability and reproducibility.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/B-OvrhCl9FE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anne L.

HLA proteins have an essential role in the presentation of self and non-self peptides, as part of the adaptive immune response. Amongst the associated drugs-allele combinations, anti-HIV drug Abacavir has been shown to be associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele, and anti-epilepsy drug Carbamazepine with B*15:02, in both cases likely following the altered peptide repertoire model of interaction. Under this model, the drug binds directly to the antigen presentation region, causing different self peptides to be presented, which trigger an unwanted immune response. There is growing interest in searching for evidence supporting this model for other ADRs using bioinformatics techniques. In this study, in silico docking was used to assess the utility and reliability of well-known docking programs when addressing these challenging HLA-drug situations. Four docking programs: SwissDock, ROSIE, AutoDock Vina and AutoDockFR, were used to investigate if each software could accurately dock the Abacavir back into the crystal structure for the protein arising from the known risk allele, and if they were able to distinguish between the HLA-associated and non-HLA-associated (control) alleles. The impact of using homology models on the docking performance and how using different parameters such as including receptor flexibility affected the docking performance, were also investigated to simulate the approach where a crystal structure for a given HLA allele may be unavailable. The programs that were best able to predict the binding position of Abacavir were then used to recreate the docking seen for Carbamazepine with B*15:02 and controls alleles. It was found that the programmes investigated were sometimes able to correctly predict the binding mode of Abacavir with B*57:01 but not always. Each of the software packages that were assessed could predict the binding of Abacavir and Carbamazepine within the correct sub-pocket and, with the exception of ROSIE, was able to correctly distinguish between risk and control alleles. We found that docking to homology models could produce poorer quality predictions, especially when sequence differences impact the architecture of predicted binding pockets. Caution must therefore be used as inaccurate structures may lead to erroneous docking predictions. Incorporating receptor flexibility was found to negatively affect the docking performance for the examples investigated. Taken together, our findings help characterise the potential but also the limitations of computational prediction of drug-HLA interactions. These docking techniques should therefore always be used with care and alongside other methods of investigation, in order to be able to draw strong conclusions from the given results.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/06/296574</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523048372712</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><fingerprint>93ed513a</fingerprint><description>Adverse drug reactions have been linked with genetic polymorphisms in HLA genes in numerous different studies.

There is growing interest in searching for evidence supporting this model for other ADRs using bioinformatics techniques. In this study, in silico docking was used to assess the utility and reliability of well-known docking programs when addressing these challenging HLA-drug situations. Four docking programs: SwissDock, ROSIE, AutoDock Vina and AutoDockFR, were used to investigate if each software could accurately dock the Abacavir back into the crystal structure for the protein arising from the known risk allele, and if they were able to distinguish between the HLA-associated and non-HLA-associated (control) alleles. The impact of using homology models on the docking performance and how using different parameters such as including receptor flexibility affected the docking performance, were also investigated to simulate the approach where a crystal structure for a given HLA allele may be unavailable. The programs that were best able to predict the binding position of Abacavir were then used to recreate the docking seen for Carbamazepine with B*15:02 and controls alleles. It was found that the programmes investigated were sometimes able to correctly predict the binding mode of Abacavir with B*57:01 but not always. Each of the software packages that were assessed could predict the binding of Abacavir and Carbamazepine within the correct sub-pocket and, with the exception of ROSIE, was able to correctly distinguish between risk and control alleles. We found that docking to homology models could produce poorer quality predictions, especially when sequence differences impact the architecture of predicted binding pockets. Caution must therefore be used as inaccurate structures may lead to erroneous docking predictions. Incorporating receptor flexibility was found to negatively affect the docking performance for the examples investigated. Taken together, our findings help characterise the potential but also the limitations of computational prediction of drug-HLA interactions. These docking techniques should therefore always be used with care and alongside other methods of investigation, in order to be able to draw strong conclusions from the given results.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/296574v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ramsbottom, K.

TDP-43 is an ubiquitous and highly conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in several cellular processes including pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, mRNA stability and transport. Notwithstanding the evidence of TDP-43 involvement in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative disorders (i.e. ALS and FTLD), the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Given the high degree of functional similarity between the human and fly orthologs of TDP-43, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; is a simple and useful model to study the pathophysiological role of this protein &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. It has been demonstrated that the depletion of the TDP-43 fly ortholog (tbph) induces deficient locomotive behaviors and reduces life span and anatomical defects at the neuromuscular junction. In this study, using the known binding specificity of TDP-43/tbph for (UG) repeated sequences, we performed a bioinformatic screening for fly genes with at least 6 (TG) repeats in a row within the 3&apos;-UTR regions in order to identify the genes that might be regulated by this factor. Among these genes, we were able to identify RhoGAPp190 as a potential target of the tbph-mediated neurodegeneration. RhoGAPp190 is a negative regulator of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; RhoA, a GTPase protein implicated in the fine modulation of critical cellular processes including axon branch stability and motor axon defasciculation at muscle level and cognitive processes. We were able to demonstrate that the RhoGAPp190 expression is upregulated in a tbph-null fly model, providing evidence that this deregulation is associated to tbph silencing. Our results introduce RhoGAPp190 as a novel potential mediator in the complex scenario of events resulting from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tbph loss-of-function.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195845</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>886166b2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Simona Langellotti, Giulia Romano, Fabian Feiguin, Francisco Ernesto Baralle, Maurizio Romano&lt;/p&gt;

Network analysis of large metagenomic datasets generated by current sequencing technologies can reveal significant co-occurrence patterns between microbial species of a biological community. These patterns can be analyzed in terms of pairwise combinations between all species comprising a community. Here, we construct a co-occurrence network for abundant microbial species encompassing the three dominant phyla found in human gut. This was followed by an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; evaluation of the predicted microbe-microbe co-occurrences, where we chose species pairs &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium adolescentis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Roseburia inulinivorans&lt;/i&gt; as model organisms for our study. We then delineate the outcome of the co-cultures when equal distributions of resources were provided. The growth behavior of the co-culture was found to be dependent on the types of microbial species present, their specific metabolic activities, and resulting changes in the culture environment.

The aim of the present study is to differentiate subtypes of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) using ex vivo ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Included were 14 surgically resected hippocampi of patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The resected hippocampi were histologically categorized into subtypes of hippocampal sclerosis (HS type 1 (n = 10), HS type 2 (n = 2) and no-HS (n = 2)) and subsequently scanned on a preclinical 7T MRI acquiring T2-weighted morphology, relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging. On the morphological images, the pyramidal cell layer (PCL) of the hippocampus was segmented and the following parameters were derived: T2 signal intensity, T1-, T2- and T2*-relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Furthermore, the area of the PCL was determined, as well as the parameter product which refers to the widths of the PCL parallel and perpendicular to the stratum moleculare. Spearman correlation coefficient was used to demonstrate relationships between MR-parameters and type of sclerosis. In comparison to no-HS specimens, the PCL was significantly narrower in HS type 1 and HS type 2 hippocampi. This narrowing affected the entire cornu ammonis sector (CA) 1 in HS type 1, while it was limited to the upper half of CA1 in direction to CA2 in HS type 2. The parameter product median increased from 0.43 to 1.67 and 2.91 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for HS type 1, HS type 2 and no-HS, respectively. Correlation coefficients were significant for the PCL parameters product (0.73), area (0.71), T2*-time (-0.67), FA (0.65) and ADC (0.55). Our initial results suggest that HS type 1, HS type 2 and no-HS subtypes can be distinguished from each other using ex vivo UHF MRI based on T2-weighted morphologic images and the assessment of the parameter product. Upon clinical translation, UHF-MRI may provide a promising technique for the preoperative differentiation of HS subtypes in patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196008</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524074227579</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>14c9f5b3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Clarissa Gillmann, Roland Coras, Karl Rössler, Arnd Doerfler, Michael Uder, Ingmar Blümcke, Tobias Bäuerle&lt;/p&gt;

DNA methylation is mediated by a conserved family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). The human genome encodes three active Dnmts (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b), the tRNA methyltransferase Dnmt2, and the regulatory protein Dnmt3L. Despite their high degree of conservation among different species, genes encoding Dnmts have been duplicated and/or lost in multiple lineages throughout evolution, indicating that the DNA methylation machinery has some potential to undergo evolutionary change. However, little is known about the extent to which this machinery, or the methylome, varies among vertebrates. Here, we study the molecular evolution of Dnmt1, the enzyme responsible for maintenance of DNA methylation patterns after replication, in 79 vertebrate species. Our analyses show that all studied species exhibit a single copy of the &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; gene, with the exception of tilapia and marsupials (tammar wallaby, koala, Tasmanian devil and opossum), each of which displays two apparently functional &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; duplicated before the radiation of major marsupial groups (i.e., at least ~75 million years ago), thus giving rise to two &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies in marsupials (copy 1 and copy 2). In the opossum lineage, copy 2 was lost, and copy 1 recently duplicated again, generating three &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies: two putatively functional genes (copy 1a and 1b) and one pseudogene (copy 1ψ). Both marsupial copies (&lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies 1 and 2) are under purifying selection, and copy 2 exhibits elevated rates of evolution and signatures of positive selection, suggesting a scenario of neofunctionalization. This gene duplication might have resulted in modifications in marsupial methylomes and their dynamics.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195162</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>22f41d4c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Alvarez-Ponce, María Torres-Sánchez, Felix Feyertag, Asmita Kulkarni, Taylen Nappi&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;As genomic research gathers momentum in sub-Saharan Africa, it has become increasingly important to understand the reasons why individuals wish to participate in this kind of medical research. Against the background of communitarianism conceived as typical of African communities, it is often suggested that individuals consent to participate on the grounds of solidarity and to further the common good. In this paper, we seek to explore this contention by presenting data from focus groups with potential research participants about what would influence their decisions to participate in genomic research.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;These focus groups were conducted as part of a larger qualitative study with a purposively selected group of participants from a community situated in south west Nigeria. We conducted fifteen focus group sessions comprising 50 participants organized by age and sex, namely: 1) adult (&gt;30 years) males, 2) adult females, 3) youth (18–30 years) males, and 4) youth females. A mixed age-group was conducted to probe different views between the age groups. There was discordance and clear division between the adults and youths regarding the decision to participate in genomic research based on commitment to communal values. Adults based their decision to participate on altruism and furthering the common good while youths based their decisions on personal benefits and preferences and also took into account the views and welfare of family members and neighbours.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This discordance suggests a ‘generational shift’ and we advance a model of ‘relative solidarity’ among the youths, which is different from the communal solidarity model typical of African communitarianism. Our findings suggest the need for a closer look at strategies for implementation of community engagement and informed consent in genomic research in this region, and we recommend further studies to explore this emerging trend.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195171</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8cb246f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Olubunmi Ogunrin, Kerry Woolfall, Mark Gabbay, Lucy Frith&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings suggest the need for a closer look at strategies for implementation of community engagement and informed consent in genomic research in this region, and we recommend further studies to explore this emerging trend.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195171</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Olubunmi Ogunrin</name></author><title>Relative solidarity: Conceptualising communal participation in genomic research among potential research participants in a developing Sub-Saharan African setting</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f45ff:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195171</link><published>1522962000000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24079-7</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unravelling the inhibitory activity of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; sulfated polysaccharides against α-Synuclein fibrillation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unravelling the inhibitory activity of &amp;lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&amp;lt;/i&gt; sulfated polysaccharides against α-Synuclein fibrillation, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24079-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24079-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Unravelling the inhibitory activity of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; sulfated polysaccharides against α-Synuclein fibrillation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/MyOVANCEtDo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unravelling the inhibitory activity of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; sulfated polysaccharides against α-Synuclein fibrillation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unravelling the inhibitory activity of &amp;lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&amp;lt;/i&gt; sulfated polysaccharides against α-Synuclein fibrillation, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24079-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24079-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Unravelling the inhibitory activity of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; sulfated polysaccharides against α-Synuclein fibrillation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/MyOVANCEtDo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>321</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24079-7/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24079_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width></visual><crawled>1523265642650</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7162998e</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24079-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/MyOVANCEtDo/s41598-018-24079-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Sinjan Choudhary</name></author><title>Unravelling the inhibitory activity of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii sulfated polysaccharides against α-Synuclein fibrillation</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162a9b5209a:142c874:7c9981b6</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24079-7</link><published>1523257200000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196021</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Molly Brunner, Noémie Mandier, Thierry Gautier, Genevieve Chevalier, Anne-Sophie Ribba, Philippe Guardiola, Marc R.

Osteoblast differentiation is a highly regulated process that requires coordinated information from both soluble factors and the extracellular matrix. Among these extracellular stimuli, chemical and physical properties of the matrix are sensed through cell surface receptors such as integrins and transmitted into the nucleus to drive specific gene expression. Here, we showed that the conditional deletion of β1 integrins in the osteo-precursor population severely impacts bone formation and homeostasis both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Mutant mice displayed a severe bone deficit characterized by bone fragility and reduced bone mass. We showed that β1 integrins are required for proper BMP2 dependent signaling at the pre-osteoblastic stage, by positively modulating Smad1/5-dependent transcriptional activity at the nuclear level. The lack of β1 integrins results in a transcription modulation that relies on a cooperative defect with other transcription factors rather than a plain blunted BMP2 response. Our results point to a nuclear modulation of Smad1/5 transcriptional activity by β1 integrins, allowing a tight control of osteoblast differentiation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196021</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f42ce162</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Molly Brunner, Noémie Mandier, Thierry Gautier, Genevieve Chevalier, Anne-Sophie Ribba, Philippe Guardiola, Marc R.

Amnion is a membrane surrounding the embryo/fetus which determine growth factors and interleukins with angiogenic, immunogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of conditioned culture medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion (hAM CCM) on migration and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial primary cells (HUVECs), freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs), and Jurkat leukemia cell line. Amnion membrane was freshly isolated from healthy placenta and its fragments cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to produce hAM CCM. Members of the IGFBP protein family made up one third of all assayed proteins present in the hAM medium. The hAM CCM did not affect the proliferation rate of HUVECs or MNCs, but we observed more intensive migration of those cells, and lower expression of CD31 surface antigen on HUVECs as compared to control cultures. In contrast, Jurkat cells did not respond to hAM CCM treatment by proliferation or mobility change. The conditioned medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion is easy to obtain and is a convenient source of various growth and other factors that may be useful in practical medicine.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195035</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>93b0fe42</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zofia Grzywocz, Grazyna Hoser, Stanislawa Sabalinska, Piotr Ladyzynski, Jaroslaw Czubak, Malgorzata Dworczynska, Romuald Debski, Ewa Pius-Sadowska, Boguslaw Machalinski, Jerzy Kawiak&lt;/p&gt;

The cutaneous silent period is an inhibitory evoked response that demonstrates a wide variety of responses in muscles of the human upper limb. Classically, the cutaneous silent period results in a characteristic muscle pattern of extensor inhibition and flexor facilitation within the upper limb, in the presence of nociceptive input. The aims of the current study were: 1) to primarily investigate the presence and characteristics of the cutaneous silent period response across multiple extensor and flexor muscles of the upper limb, and 2) to secondarily investigate the influence of stimulation site on this nociceptive reflex response. It was hypothesized that the cutaneous silent period would be present in all muscles, regardless of role (flexion/extension) or the stimulation site. Twenty-two healthy, university-age adults (14 males; 8 females; 23 ± 5 yrs) participated in the study. Testing consisted of three different stimulation sites (Digit II, V, and II+III nociceptive stimulation) during a low intensity, sustained muscle contraction, in which, 7 upper limb muscles were monitored via surface EMG recording electrodes. Distal muscles of the upper limb presented with the earliest reflex onset times, longest reflex duration, and lowest level of EMG suppression when compared to the more proximal muscles, regardless of extensor/flexor role. Additionally, the greatest overall inhibitory influence was expressed within the distal muscles. In conclusion, the present study provides a new level of refinement within the current understanding of the spinal organization associated with nociceptive input processing and the associated motor control of the upper limb. Subsequently, these results have further implications on the impact of nociception on supraspinal processing.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196129</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e7139302</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathanial R.

Sunscreen users are often inadequately protected and become sunburned. This study aimed to investigate how much two consecutive sunscreen applications increased the quantity of sunscreen applied and decreased the skin area left without sunscreen (missed area) compared to a single application. Thirty-one healthy volunteers wearing swimwear were included and applied sunscreen two consecutive times in a laboratory environment. Participants had pictures taken in black light before and after each application. As sunscreens absorb black light, the darkness of the skin increased with increasing amounts of sunscreen applied. We conducted a standard curve establishing a link between change in picture darkness and quantity of sunscreen. The quantity of sunscreen at selected skin sites as well as the percentage of missed area was determined after each application. Participants had missed a median of 20% of their available body surface after a single application. After double application they had missed 9%. The decrease in missed areas was significant for the whole body surface and for each of the body regions separately. The median participant had applied between 13% and 100% more sunscreen at the selected skin sites after double application than after single application. We recommend double application, especially before intense sun exposure.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193916</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ad78f125</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ida M.

&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most important plant pathogens in the world, causing root rot in more than a thousand plant species. This observational study was carried out on a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; infected heathland of &lt;i&gt;Erica umbellata&lt;/i&gt; used as goat pasture. The patterns and shapes of disease foci and their distribution were described in a spatial and temporal context using an aerial photograph record. A set of topographic traits was selected on the basis of a disease dynamic hypothesis and their effects on observed spatial disease patterns were analyzed. Incipient infections situated in flat terrain expanded as compact circular front patterns with a low growth rate. On slopes, disease patches developed more rapidly down slope, forming parabolic shapes. The axis direction of the parabolas was highly correlated with terrain aspect, while the parabolic amplitude was associated with land curvature and slope. New secondary foci appeared over the years producing an accelerated increase of the affected surface. These new foci were observed in sites where disease density was higher or near sites more frequently visited by animals such as the stable or the forage crop. In contrast, a smaller number of disease foci occur in areas which animals are reluctant to visit, such as where they have a short range of vision. Our results suggest that 1) the growth of existing &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; foci is controlled by a combination of root-to-root contact and water flows, 2) the increase in the diseased area arises mainly from the multiplication of patches, 3) the formation of new foci is mediated by long-distance transport due to the movement of animals and humans along certain preferential pathways, and 4) geomorphology and topography traits are associated with the epidemiology of this soil-borne pathogen.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195060</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7f82b0f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enrique Cardillo, Angel Acedo, Enrique Abad&lt;/p&gt;

The present study evaluated auditory sensitivity to spectral modulation by determining the modulation depth required to detect modulation phase reversal. This approach may be preferable to spectral modulation detection with a spectrally flat standard, since listeners appear unable to perform the task based on the detection of temporal modulation. While phase reversal thresholds are often evaluated by holding modulation depth constant and adjusting modulation rate, holding rate constant and adjusting modulation depth supports rate-specific assessment of modulation processing. Stimuli were pink noise samples, filtered into seven octave-wide bands (0.125–8 kHz) and spectrally modulated in dB. Experiment 1 measured performance as a function of modulation depth to determine appropriate units for adaptive threshold estimation. Experiment 2 compared thresholds in dB for modulation detection with a flat standard and modulation phase reversal; results supported the idea that temporal cues were available at high rates for the former but not the latter. Experiment 3 evaluated spectral modulation phase reversal thresholds for modulation that was restricted to either one or two neighboring bands. Flanking bands of unmodulated noise had a larger detrimental effect on one-band than two-band targets. Thresholds for high-rate modulation improved with increasing carrier frequency up to 2 kHz, whereas low-rate modulation appeared more consistent across frequency, particularly in the two-band condition. Experiment 4 measured spectral weights for spectral modulation phase reversal detection and found higher weights for bands in the spectral center of the stimulus than for the lowest (0.125 kHz) or highest (8 kHz) band. Experiment 5 compared performance for highly practiced and relatively naïve listeners, and found weak evidence of a larger practice effect at high than low spectral modulation rates. These results provide preliminary data for a task that may provide a better estimate of sensitivity to spectral modulation than spectral modulation detection with a flat standard.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195686</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6e45d9a8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emily Buss, John Grose&lt;/p&gt;

These results provide preliminary data for a task that may provide a better estimate of sensitivity to spectral modulation than spectral modulation detection with a flat standard.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195686</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Emily Buss</name></author><title>Auditory sensitivity to spectral modulation phase reversal as a function of modulation depth</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d74d:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195686</link><published>1522962000000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24799-w</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Quantifying Nearshore Sea Turtle Densities: Applications of Unmanned Aerial Systems for Population Assessments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Quantifying Nearshore Sea Turtle Densities: Applications of Unmanned Aerial Systems for Population Assessments, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24799-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24799-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Quantifying Nearshore Sea Turtle Densities: Applications of Unmanned Aerial Systems for Population Assessments&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/YI5737vMgts&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Quantifying Nearshore Sea Turtle Densities: Applications of Unmanned Aerial Systems for Population Assessments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Quantifying Nearshore Sea Turtle Densities: Applications of Unmanned Aerial Systems for Population Assessments, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24799-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24799-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Quantifying Nearshore Sea Turtle Densities: Applications of Unmanned Aerial Systems for Population Assessments&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/YI5737vMgts&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1524122516644</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fcb0d934</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24799-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/YI5737vMgts/s41598-018-24799-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Seth T.

L-Proline is a multifunctional amino acid that plays an essential role in primary metabolism and physiological functions. Proline is oxidized to glutamate in the mitochondria and the FAD-containing enzyme proline oxidase (PO) catalyzes the first step in L-proline degradation pathway. Alterations in proline metabolism have been described in various human diseases, such as hyperprolinemia type I, velo-cardio-facial syndrome/Di George syndrome, schizophrenia and cancer. In particular, the mutation giving rise to the substitution &lt;i&gt;Leu441Pro&lt;/i&gt; was identified in patients suffering of schizophrenia and hyperprolinemia type I. Here, we report on the expression of wild-type and &lt;i&gt;L441P&lt;/i&gt; variants of human PO in a U87 glioblastoma human cell line in an attempt to assess their effect on glutamate metabolism. The subcellular localization of the flavoenzyme is not altered in the &lt;i&gt;L441P&lt;/i&gt; variant, for which specific activity is halved compared to the wild-type PO. While this decrease in activity is significantly less than that previously proposed, an effect of the substitution on the enzyme stability is also apparent in our studies. At 24 hours of growth from transient transfection, the intracellular level of proline, glutamate, and glutamine is decreased in cells expressing the PO variants as compared to control U87 cells, reaching a similar figure at 72 h. On the other hand, the extracellular levels of the three selected amino acids show a similar time course for all clones. Furthermore, PO overexpression does not modify to a significant extent the expression of GLAST and GLT-1 glutamate transporters. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the proline pathway links cellular proline levels with those of glutamate and glutamine. On this side, PO might play a regulatory role in glutamatergic neurotransmission by affecting the cellular concentration of glutamate.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196283</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>113a5b2b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pamela Cappelletti, Elena Tallarita, Valentina Rabattoni, Paola Campomenosi, Silvia Sacchi, Loredano Pollegioni&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, the difference of distributions of key features in two allosteric states also underlies the population shift hypothesis of dynamics‐driven allostery model. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24601-x</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: WNT-activated bone grafts repair osteonecrotic lesions in aged animals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: WNT-activated bone grafts repair osteonecrotic lesions in aged animals, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24601-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24601-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: WNT-activated bone grafts repair osteonecrotic lesions in aged animals&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/MjAuD-H6veU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: WNT-activated bone grafts repair osteonecrotic lesions in aged animals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: WNT-activated bone grafts repair osteonecrotic lesions in aged animals, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24601-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24601-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: WNT-activated bone grafts repair osteonecrotic lesions in aged animals&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/MjAuD-H6veU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523917193282</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2b26e891</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24601-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/MjAuD-H6veU/s41598-018-24601-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>B.

How they become immortal and how their specific features can be exploited to combat tumorigenesis are key questions in tumor biology. Here we describe the long non-coding RNA cherub that is critically required for the development of brain tumors in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; but is dispensable for normal development. In mitotic &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neural stem cells, cherub localizes to the cell periphery and segregates into the differentiating daughter cell. During tumorigenesis, de-differentiation of cherub-high cells leads to the formation of tumorigenic stem cells that accumulate abnormally high cherub levels. We show that cherub establishes a molecular link between the RNA-binding proteins Staufen and Syncrip.

How they become immortal and how their specific features can be exploited to combat tumorigenesis are key questions in tumor biology. Here we describe the long non-coding RNA cherub that is critically required for the development of brain tumors in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; but is dispensable for normal development. In mitotic &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neural stem cells, cherub localizes to the cell periphery and segregates into the differentiating daughter cell. During tumorigenesis, de-differentiation of cherub-high cells leads to the formation of tumorigenic stem cells that accumulate abnormally high cherub levels. We show that cherub establishes a molecular link between the RNA-binding proteins Staufen and Syncrip.

The phytohormones auxin and cytokinin control development and maintenance of plant meristems and stem cell systems. Fluorescent protein reporter lines that monitor phytohormone controlled gene expression programmes have been widely used to study development and differentiation in the model species Arabidopsis, but equivalent tools are still missing for the majority of crop species. Barley (&lt;i&gt;Hordeum vulgare&lt;/i&gt;) is the fourth most abundant cereal crop plant, but knowledge on these important phytohormones in regard to the barley root and shoot stem cell niches is still negligible. We have now analysed the role of auxin and cytokinin in barley root meristem development, and present fluorescent protein reporter lines that allow to dissect auxin and cytokinin signalling outputs in vivo. We found that application of either auxin or cytokinin to barley seedlings negatively impacts root meristem growth. We further established a barley cytokinin reporter, &lt;i&gt;TCSnew&lt;/i&gt;, which revealed significant cytokinin signalling in the stele cells proximal to the QC, and in the differentiated root cap cells. Application of exogenous cytokinin activated signalling in the root stem cell niche. Commonly employed auxin reporters DR5 or DR5v2 failed to respond to auxin in barley. However, analysis of putative auxin signalling targets barley PLETHORA1 (HvPLT1) is expressed in a similar pattern as its orthologue AtPLT1 from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. in the QC and the surrounding cells. Furthermore, the PINFORMED1 (HvPIN1) auxin efflux carrier was found to be expressed in root and shoot meristems, where it polarly localized to the plasma membrane. HvPIN1 expression is negatively regulated by cytokinin and its intracellular localisation is sensitive to brefeldinA (BFA). With this study, we provide the first fluorescent reporter lines as a tool to study auxin and cytokinin signalling and response pathways in barley.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196086</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8e73c12e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gwendolyn K.

In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of repeated brain metastases (BM) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS2) following local failure of a prior radiosurgical procedure (SRS1). Between December 1996 and August 2015, 30 patients with 36 BM underwent SRS2 with a median dose of 18Gy. All BM were located outside critical structures. Following SRS2, local control at 6 months and one year were respectively 82.9% (IC 95%: 67.6–91.9) and 67.8% (IC 95%: 51–81). On multivariate analysis, planning target volume (PTV) &amp;lt; 3cc (HR: 0.19 (0.1–0.52)) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) prior to SRS2 (HR: 0.25 (0.1–0.64)) were significantly associated with a better local control. One- and two-year overall survival rates after SRS2 were respectively 65.5% (IC 95%: 47.3–80%) and 27.6% (IC 95%: 14.7–45.7). Median overall survival following SRS2 was 14.2 months (range 1–106). Nineteen (63%) patients died from progressive systemic disease. Three (10%) patients died from out-field progressive brain disease and 8 (27%) in-field. Concerning toxicities, edema, radionecrosis, and hemorrhages were identified in 5 (12.8%), 4 (10.2%), and 5 (12.8%) patients respectively. No toxicity resulted in a neurological deficit. On univariate analysis, toxicities were significantly associated with PTV &gt; 7cc (p = 0.02) and all patients had a WBRT before SRS2. A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases showed encouraging rates of local control. This treatment led to acceptable toxicities, especially for brain metastases smaller than 7cc, in our selected cohort of patients with BM located outside critical structures.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In light of the limited impact the syndromic management approach has had on the global sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic, we assessed a care model comprising point-of-care (POC) STI testing, immediate treatment, and expedited partner therapy (EPT) among a cohort of young women at high HIV risk in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;HIV negative women presenting for STI care underwent POC testing for &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT), &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; (NG) and &lt;i&gt;Trichomonas vaginalis&lt;/i&gt; (TV), and swabs were sent for NG culture and susceptibility testing. Results were available within 2 hours and women with STIs were immediately treated and offered EPT packs, including medication, condoms, and information for sexual partners. An EPT questionnaire was administered after one week, and women retested for STIs after 6 and 12 weeks. 267 women, median age 23 (IQR 21–26), were recruited and 88.4% (236/267) reported genital symptoms. STI prevalence was CT 18.4% (95%CI 13.7–23.0), NG 5.2% (95%CI 2.6–7.9) and TV 3.0% (95%CI 1.0–5.0). After 12 weeks, all but one NG and two CT infections were cleared. No cephalosporin-resistant NG was detected. Of 63/267 women (23.6%) diagnosed with STIs, 98.4% (62/63) were offered and 87.1% (54/62) accepted EPT. At one week 88.9% (48/54) stated that their partner had taken the medication. No allergic reactions or social harms were reported. Of 51 women completing 6-week follow up, detection rates were lower amongst women receiving EPT (2.2%, 1/46) compared to those who did not (40.0%, 2/5), p = 0.023. During focus group discussions women supported the care model, because they received a rapid, specific diagnosis, and could facilitate their partners’ treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;POC STI testing and EPT were acceptable to young South African women and their partners, and could play an important role in reducing STI reinfection rates and HIV risk.

Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) respond to numerous hormonal and neural signals, resulting in changes in food intake. Here, we demonstrate that ARC POMC neurons express capsaicin-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1)-like receptors. To show expression of TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons, we use single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, TRPV1 knock-out (KO), and TRPV1-Cre knock-in mice. A small elevation of temperature in the physiological range is enough to depolarize ARC POMC neurons. This depolarization is blocked by the TRPV1 receptor antagonist and by &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt; gene knockdown. Capsaicin-induced activation reduces food intake that is abolished by a melanocortin receptor antagonist. To selectively stimulate TRPV1-like receptor-expressing ARC POMC neurons in the ARC, we generate an adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) carrying a Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) expression cassette under the control of the two neuronal POMC enhancers (nPEs). Optogenetic stimulation of TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neurons decreases food intake. Hypothalamic temperature is rapidly elevated and reaches to approximately 39 °C during treadmill running. This elevation is associated with a reduction in food intake. Knockdown of the &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt; gene exclusively in ARC POMC neurons blocks the feeding inhibition produced by increased hypothalamic temperature. Taken together, our findings identify a melanocortinergic circuit that links acute elevations in hypothalamic temperature with acute reductions in food intake.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LGEs5NFlL1s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jae Hoon Jeong, Dong Kun Lee, Shun-Mei Liu, Streamson C.

To show expression of TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons, we use single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, TRPV1 knock-out (KO), and TRPV1-Cre knock-in mice. A small elevation of temperature in the physiological range is enough to depolarize ARC POMC neurons. This depolarization is blocked by the TRPV1 receptor antagonist and by &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt; gene knockdown. Capsaicin-induced activation reduces food intake that is abolished by a melanocortin receptor antagonist. To selectively stimulate TRPV1-like receptor-expressing ARC POMC neurons in the ARC, we generate an adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) carrying a Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) expression cassette under the control of the two neuronal POMC enhancers (nPEs). Optogenetic stimulation of TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neurons decreases food intake. Hypothalamic temperature is rapidly elevated and reaches to approximately 39 °C during treadmill running. This elevation is associated with a reduction in food intake. Knockdown of the &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt; gene exclusively in ARC POMC neurons blocks the feeding inhibition produced by increased hypothalamic temperature. Taken together, our findings identify a melanocortinergic circuit that links acute elevations in hypothalamic temperature with acute reductions in food intake.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LGEs5NFlL1s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>903106e8</fingerprint><recrawled>1524594787541</recrawled><crawled>1524591809657</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><title>Activation of temperature-sensitive TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons reduces food intake</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004399</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/LGEs5NFlL1s/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jae Hoon Jeong</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>0.46</engagementRate><engagement>6</engagement><updated>1524603600000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f8c0d479:29c068:ae8b474d</id><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004399</link><published>1524603600000</published></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33318</originId><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33318</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522066234610</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6568483</fingerprint><description>The pituitary is an essential endocrine gland regulating multiple processes.

Our human model of nasal colonization and eradication of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; is limited by safety issues. As rhesus macaques are closely related to humans and natural hosts for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;, we developed an experimental decolonization and inoculation protocol in these animals. Animals were screened for nasal carriage of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; and 20 carriers were selected. Decolonization was attempted using nasal mupirocin (10 animals) or mupirocin plus trimethoprim/sulfadiazine intramuscularly (10 animals) both once daily for 5 days, and checked by follow-up cultures for 10 weeks. Intranasal inoculation was performed with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; strain 8325–4 in culture-negative animals. 11/20 animals, of which 5 received mupirocin and 6 the combination treatment, became culture-negative for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; for 10 weeks and these 11 animals were subsequently inoculated. Swabs were taken once a week for 5 weeks to test for the presence of the inoculated strain. In 3 animals, strain 8325–4 was cultured from the nose 1 week after inoculation, indicating short-term survival of this strain only, a finding similar to that previously found in our human model.

The ecology of Lyme borreliosis is complex in northwestern California, with several potential reservoir hosts, tick vectors, and genospecies of &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato. The primary objective of this study was to determine the fine-scale spatial distribution of different genospecies in four rodent species, the California ground squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Otospermophilus beecheyi&lt;/i&gt;), northern flying squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Glaucomys sabrinus&lt;/i&gt;), dusky-footed woodrat (&lt;i&gt;Neotoma fuscipes&lt;/i&gt;), and Allen’s chipmunk (&lt;i&gt;Neotamias senex&lt;/i&gt;). Rodents were live-trapped between June 2004 and May 2005 at the Hoopa Valley Tribal Reservation (HVTR) in Humboldt County, California. Ear-punch biopsies obtained from each rodent were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis. The programs ArcGIS and SaTScan were used to examine the spatial distribution of genospecies. Multinomial log-linear models were used to model habitat and host-specific characteristics and their effect on the presence of each borrelial genospecies. The Akaike information criterion (AICc) was used to compare models and determine model fit. &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was primarily associated with chipmunks and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; largely with woodrats. The top model included the variables “host species”, “month”, and “elevation” (weight = 0.84). Spatial clustering of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; was detected in the northwestern section of the HVTR, whereas &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was clustered in the southeastern section. We conclude that the spatial distribution of these borreliae are driven at least in part by host species, time-of-year, and elevation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195586</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>968b65e3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gregory M.

The top model included the variables “host species”, “month”, and “elevation” (weight = 0.84). Spatial clustering of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; was detected in the northwestern section of the HVTR, whereas &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was clustered in the southeastern section. We conclude that the spatial distribution of these borreliae are driven at least in part by host species, time-of-year, and elevation.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195586</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Gregory M.

Neuronal information processing is regulated by fast and localized fluctuations of brain states. Brain states reliably switch between distinct spatiotemporal signatures at a network scale even though they are composed of heterogeneous and variable rhythms at a cellular scale. We investigated the mechanisms of this network control in a conductance-based population model that reliably switches between active and oscillatory mean-fields. Robust control of the mean-field properties relies critically on a switchable negative intrinsic conductance at the cellular level. This conductance endows circuits with a shared cellular positive feedback that can switch population rhythms on and off at a cellular resolution. The switch is largely independent from other intrinsic neuronal properties, network size and synaptic connectivity. It is therefore compatible with the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity induced by slower regulatory functions such as neuromodulation, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. Strikingly, the required cellular mechanism is available in all cell types that possess T-type calcium channels but unavailable in computational models that neglect the slow kinetics of their activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/12Pj_Yzaong&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Drion, Julie Dethier, Alessio Franci, Rodolphe Sepulchre&lt;/p&gt;

State-of-the-art light-sheet and confocal microscopes allow recording of entire embryos in 3D and over time (3D+t) for many hours. Fluorescently labeled structures can be segmented and tracked automatically in these terabyte-scale 3D+t images, resulting in thousands of cell migration trajectories that provide detailed insights to large-scale tissue reorganization at the cellular level. Here we present EmbryoMiner, a new interactive open-source framework suitable for in-depth analyses and comparisons of entire embryos, including an extensive set of trajectory features. Starting at the whole-embryo level, the framework can be used to iteratively focus on a region of interest within the embryo, to investigate and test specific trajectory-based hypotheses and to extract quantitative features from the isolated trajectories. Thus, the new framework provides a valuable new way to quantitatively compare corresponding anatomical regions in different embryos that were manually selected based on biological prior knowledge. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 3D+t light-sheet microscopy images of zebrafish embryos, showcasing potential user applications that can be performed using the new framework.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fPwmNSZz3xw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Schott, Manuel Traub, Cornelia Schlagenhauf, Masanari Takamiya, Thomas Antritter, Andreas Bartschat, Katharina Löffler, Denis Blessing, Jens C.

Since the shooting of Black teenager Michael Brown by White police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, the protest hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has amplified critiques of extrajudicial killings of Black Americans. In response to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted #AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis of over 860,000 tweets, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse. We find that #AllLivesMatter facilitates opposition between #BlackLivesMatter and hashtags such as #PoliceLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter in such a way that historically echoes the tension between Black protesters and law enforcement. In addition, we show that a significant portion of #AllLivesMatter use stems from hijacking by #BlackLivesMatter advocates. Beyond simply injecting #AllLivesMatter with #BlackLivesMatter content, these hijackers use the hashtag to directly confront the counter-protest notion of “All lives matter.” Our findings suggest that Black Lives Matter movement was able to grow, exhibit diverse conversations, and avoid derailment on social media by making discussion of counter-protest opinions a central topic of #AllLivesMatter, rather than the movement itself.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195644</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524073508287</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9795cd16</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryan J.

Mechanical ventilation is an important tool for supporting critically ill patients but may also exert pathological forces on lung cells leading to Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI). We hypothesised that inhibition of the force-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV4) ion channel may attenuate the negative effects of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical stretch increased intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung epithelial cells that was partially blocked by about 30% with the selective TRPV4 inhibitor GSK2193874, but nearly completely blocked with the pan-calcium channel blocker ruthenium red, suggesting the involvement of more than one calcium channel in the response to mechanical stress. Mechanical stretch also induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from M1 macrophages, but in contrast this was entirely dependent upon TRPV4. In a murine ventilation model, TRPV4 inhibition attenuated both pulmonary barrier permeability increase and pro-inflammatory cytokines release due to high tidal volume ventilation. Taken together, these data suggest TRPV4 inhibitors may have utility as a prophylactic pharmacological treatment to improve the negative pathological stretch-response of lung cells during ventilation and potentially support patients receiving mechanical ventilation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196055</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523986744698</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>425da426</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by N.

Tissue perfusion during surgery is important in reducing surgical site infections and promoting healing. This study aimed to determine if insufflation of the open abdomen with heated, humidified (HH) carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) increased visceral tissue perfusion and core body temperature during open abdominal surgery in a rodent model. Using two different rodent models of open abdominal surgery, visceral perfusion and core temperature were measured. Visceral perfusion was investigated using a repeated measures crossover experiment with rodents receiving the same sequence of two alternating treatments: exposure to ambient air (no insufflation) and insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Core body temperature was measured using an independent experimental design with three treatment groups: ambient air, HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cold, dry (CD) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Visceral perfusion was measured by laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) and core body temperature was measured with a rectal thermometer. Insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a rodent open abdominal cavity significantly increased visceral tissue perfusion (2.4 perfusion units (PU)/min (95% CI 1.23–3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001) compared with ambient air, which significantly reduced visceral blood flow (-5.20 PU/min (95% CI -6.83- -3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001). Insufflation of HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the open abdominal cavity significantly increased core body temperature (+1.15 ± 0.14°C) compared with open cavities exposed to ambient air (-0.65 ± 0.52°C; p = 0.037), or cavities insufflated with CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (-0.73 ± 0.33°C; p = 0.006). Abdominal visceral temperatures also increased with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insufflation compared with ambient air or CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown by infrared thermography.

Ageing is associated with grey matter atrophy and changes in task-related neural activations. This study investigated the effects of age and education on neural activation during a spatial working memory task in 189 participants aged between 20–80 years old, whilst controlling for grey matter density. Age was related to linear decreases in neural activation in task activated areas, and this effect was no longer significant when adjusting for education or accuracy. Age was also related to cubic increases in neural activation in non-task related areas, such as the temporal gyrus, cuneus and cerebellum when adjusting for accuracy and education. These findings support previous lifespan datasets indicating linear age-related decreases in task activation, but non-linear increases in non-task related areas during episodic memory tasks. The findings also support past studies indicating education offers a form of cognitive reserve through providing a form of neural compensation and highlights the need to consider education in ageing studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194878</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8b6fabff</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jo A.

Over expression of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induces apoptosis and reduces neointima formation occurring after saphenous vein interposition grafting or coronary stenting. In studies to address the mechanism of TIMP-3-driven apoptosis in human VSMCs we find that TIMP-3 increased activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis was inhibited by expression of Cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) and dominant negative FAS-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD). TIMP-3 induced apoptosis did not cause mitochondrial depolarisation, increase activation of caspase-9 and was not inhibited by over-expression of B-cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), indicating a mitochondrial independent/type-I death receptor pathway. TIMP-3 increased levels of the First Apoptosis Signal receptor (FAS) and depletion of FAS with shRNA showed TIMP-3-induced apoptosis was FAS dependent. TIMP-3 induced formation of the Death-Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC), as detected by immunoprecipitation and by immunofluorescence. Cellular-FADD-like IL-1 converting enzyme-Like Inhibitory Protein (c-FLIP) localised with FAS at the cell periphery in the absence of TIMP-3 and this localisation was lost on TIMP-3 expression with c-FLIP adopting a perinuclear localisation. Although TIMP-3 inhibited FAS shedding, this did not increase total surface levels of FAS but instead increased FAS levels within localised regions at the cell surface. A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is inhibited by TIMP-3 and depletion of ADAM17 with shRNA significantly decreased FAS shedding. However ADAM17 depletion did not induce apoptosis or replicate the effects of TIMP-3 by increasing localised clustering of cell surface FAS. ADAM17-depleted cells could activate caspase-3 when expressing levels of TIMP-3 that were otherwise sub-apoptotic, suggesting a partial role for ADAM17 mediated ectodomain shedding in TIMP-3 mediated apoptosis. We conclude that TIMP-3 induced apoptosis in VSMCs is highly dependent on FAS and is associated with changes in FAS and c-FLIP localisation, but is not solely dependent on shedding of the FAS ectodomain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195116</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7884ae8f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by William R.

Background &lt;p&gt;While links between disability and poverty are well established, there have been few longitudinal studies to clarify direction of causality, particularly among older adults in low and middle income countries. We aimed to study the effect of care dependence among older adult residents on the economic functioning of their households, in catchment area survey sites in Peru, Mexico and China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Households were classified from the evolution of the needs for care of older residents, over two previous community surveys, as ‘incident care’, ‘chronic care’ or ‘no care’, and followed up three years later to ascertain economic outcomes (household income, consumption, economic strain, satisfaction with economic circumstances, healthcare expenditure and residents giving up work or education to care).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Household income did not differ between household groups. However, income from paid work (Pooled Count Ratio pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–1.00) and government transfers (pCR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69–0.93) were lower in care households. Consumption was 12% lower in chronic care households (pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99). Household healthcare expenditure was higher (pCR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26–1.90), and catastrophic healthcare spending more common (pRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.64–2.22) in care households.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While endogeneity cannot be confidently excluded as an explanation for the findings, this study indicates that older people’s needs for care have a discernable impact on household economics, controlling for baseline indicators of long-term economic status. Although living, typically, in multigenerational family units, older people have not featured prominently in global health and development agendas. Population ageing will rapidly increase the number of households where older people live, and their societal significance. Building sustainable long-term care systems for the future will require some combination of improved income security in old age; incentivisation of informal care through compensation for direct and opportunity costs; and development of community care services to support, and, where necessary, supplement or substitute the central role of informal caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9d62ddb3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maëlenn M.

The aim of this study was to analyze the position of the lumbopelvic region and the muscle activation of erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles in a group of pregnant women in the third trimester. The hypothesis was that pregnancy-related biomechanical and morphological changes modify the position of the lumbopelvic region and the activation of extensor muscles. The position of the lumbar spine and pelvis in the sagittal plane, and the EMG activity of the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles, were recorded during standing in 34 nulliparous and 34 pregnant women in the third trimester, and also two months after birth in the group of pregnant women. No significant differences in the position of the lumbar spine or pelvis between the group of pregnant women and nulliparous or postpartum were observed. A significant increase was observed in the EMG activity of the erector spinae (4.6% vs 2.4% and 2.1% in the nulliparous group and postpartum respectively) and the biceps femoris (3.4% vs 1.2% and 1.4%) in pregnant women compared to the other two groups (p &amp;lt;0.01). We conclude that pregnant women in the third trimester show no alterations in lumbopelvic position compared to nulliparous and postpartum women. However, there is an increase of the EMG activity of the trunk extensors. These results indicate that the extensor muscles of the trunk show, in static positions, adaptive responses to the increase of anterior loads during pregnancy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194853</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3af0ee32</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gemma Biviá-Roig, Juan Francisco Lisón, Daniel Sánchez-Zuriaga&lt;/p&gt;

A tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant mechanism is responsible for the electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions and relaxations of &lt;i&gt;Crotalus durissus terrificus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa. Here it was investigated whether this mechanism also occurs in corpora cavernosa and aortae of the non-venomous snake &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortae. Corpora cavernosa and aortic rings isolated from &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; snake were mounted in organ bath system for isometric tension recording. EFS-induced contractions in both tissues were performed in the presence and absence of guanethidine (30 μM), phentolamine (10 μM) and tetrodotoxin (1 μM). In another set of experiments, the endothelium was removed from aortic rings and EFS-induced contractions were performed in the denuded rings. Electrical field stimulation-induced contractions were frequency-dependent in &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortic rings. The contractions were significantly reduced in the presence of guanethidine (30 μM) or phentolamine (10 μM). Pre-treatment with tetrodotoxin had no effect on the EFS-induced contractions of either corpora cavernosa or aortic rings. Surprisingly, the EFS-induced contractions of aortic rings denuded of endothelium were almost abolished. These results indicate that the TTX-resistant mechanism is present in EFS-induced contractions of &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortae. The experiments performed in the aorta indicate that the endothelium is the main source for the release of catecholamines induced by EFS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196123</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524160641534</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4ef3dd09</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael Campos, Fabíola Z.

A tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant mechanism is responsible for the electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions and relaxations of &lt;i&gt;Crotalus durissus terrificus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa.

Discovery of copy number variations (CNVs), a major category of structural variations, have dramatically changed our understanding of differences between individuals and provide an alternate paradigm for the genetic basis of human diseases. CNVs include both copy gain and copy loss events and their detection genome-wide is now possible using high-throughput, low-cost next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. However, accurate detection of CNVs from NGS data is not straightforward due to non-uniform coverage of reads resulting from various systemic biases. We have developed an integrated platform, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV, to handle some of these issues in CNV detection in whole genome NGS data. It has a modular framework comprising five major modules: data pre-treatment, segmentation, variant calling, annotation and visualization. An important feature of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV is the functional annotation module that enables the user to identify and prioritize CNVs encompassing various functional elements, genomic features and disease-associations. Parallelization of the segmentation algorithms makes the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV platform even accessible on a desktop. Here we show the effect of sequencing coverage, read length, bin size, data pre-treatment and segmentation approaches on accurate detection of the complete spectrum of CNVs. Performance of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV is evaluated on both simulated data and real data for different sequencing depths.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery programme (ERAS) is an approach to the perioperative care of patients encompassing multiple interventions and involving a wide range of different actors.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty-six healthcare professionals working in three specialities (thoracic, colorectal, head and neck) in a UK hospital. Data were analysed using an adapted Framework Approach.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coherence&lt;/i&gt;, or sense-making work, was key to successful implementation and demonstrated in the importance of participants believing in ERAS both as an individual and as a team. In order to invest in ERAS individuals needed to be able to differentiate its practices favourably with those enacted pre-implementation (differentiation). Participants also needed to understand their specific tasks and responsibilities (individual specification) and build a shared understanding (communal specification), resolving differences in planning meetings.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic features of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with endplate degeneration and the association between cartilaginous fragments and inflammatory response to the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Summary of background data &lt;p&gt;LDH often involves hyaline cartilage fragments pulled from the vertebral endplates. Modic changes are closely associated with LDH that contains hyaline cartilage, and cartilaginous endplates seem to affect resorption of the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 78 patients who underwent microscopic discectomy between 9 and 16 weeks after an occurrence of LDH were reviewed. Modic changes, disc degeneration, high-intensity zone, and vertebral corner defect were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histopathological observations of cartilaginous endplates and inflamed granulation tissue in the herniated disc were made. In cases with inflamed granulation tissue, neovascularization and macrophage infiltration were also evaluated using immunohistochemical analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Modic changes were observed in approximately one-third of the patients (26 cases: type 1, 7; type 2, 17; and type 3, 2). Cartilaginous endplates were observed in 32 cases (41%) and in the majority of cases with Modic changes compared with cases without Modic changes (65%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). Although inflamed granulation tissue was observed in 60 cases (77%), no significant differences were detected in patient age and the composition of the herniated material. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that fewer CD34-positive capillaries and CD68-positive cells were found in cases with cartilaginous fragments compared with those without cartilaginous fragments (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In addition, a higher immunoreactivity to CD34 and CD68 was found in herniated discs &amp;lt;25% of whose area was occupied by cartilaginous endplates compared with discs whose area was occupied at 25% or more (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;There is an association between LDH with endplate degeneration and cartilaginous herniation, with Modic type 2 predominating.

This cell atlas dataset provides an important resource to link molecular operations to brain regions and complex neural processes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25230?af=R</originId><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1524404386520</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8024ae85</fingerprint><description>The electronic and magnetic structures of tetragonal, Cu2Sb‐type CrMnAs were examined using density functional theory.

Jeffrey Beall himself has said that it was taken down under “intense pressure” from his employer (the University of Colorado at Denver), although his employer says no, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/18/librarians-list-predatory-journals-reportedly-removed-due-threats-and-politics&quot;&gt;not at all&lt;/a&gt;, this was his personal decision. (I know which side of that story I believe more). The businesses in this area are a touchy and litigious lot – well, at least in threatening to file lawsuits, anyway – and many legal departments would surely just rather not deal with all of the potential trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It now appears, though, that the list &lt;a href=&quot;https://beallslist.weebly.com/&quot;&gt;is back online&lt;/a&gt; in updated form, but is being &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02921-2&quot;&gt;maintained anonymously&lt;/a&gt;. One of the people behind it told &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; that they spend several hours a week dealing with inquiries and maintaining the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the journal titles aren’t already listed, the manager says they carry out an “in-depth analysis” of the publishers’ policies, checking them against a set of criteria originally laid out by Beall, and researching whether they are indexed on journal ‘whitelists’, such as the Directory of Open Access Journals or Journal Citation Reports. Journals or publishers deemed untrustworthy by the manager are included in an ‘update’ addendum on the blog. By March 2018, the new site had added 85 stand-alone journals and 27 publishers to Beall’s original lists of more than one thousand titles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for them. There are people who object to the idea that such journals are being called out anonymously, and there’s no doubt that the situation is open to potential abuse (although that doesn’t seem to be what’s happening so far). But what else to do when you’re barraged by threats if you do this work openly under your own name? Cabell’s is a company that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/07/25/cabells-new-predatory-journal-blacklist-review/&quot;&gt;taken on the challenge&lt;/a&gt;, with a subscription model blacklist (and whitelist), and it would be interesting to know what kind of flak they get from the hack publishers of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As that last link says, though, there can be some confusion (and has been on Cabell’s list and others) between low-quality journals and predatory ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So what are the problems? The most serious is that, as currently configured, Cabell’s Blacklist perpetuates the common problem of conflating low-quality journal publishing with deceptive or predatory publishing. In this case, the conflation happens because many of the blacklisting criteria Cabell’s applies are really quality criteria (“poor grammar and/or spelling,” “does not have a clearly stated peer review policy,” “no policy for digital preservation,” etc.) that can easily end up gathering fundamentally honest but less-competently-run journals into the same net as those journals that are actively trying to perpetrate a scam. Predatory and incompetent journals do often evince some of the same traits, but these traits don’t always indicate predatory intent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things overlap to a good degree, but not perfectly. Many of the predatory outfits, the we-have-three-hundred-journals-and-add-two-every-day folks, tend to be very sloppy and unprofessional quick-buck artists. But there are some rather slick ones, too, that at first glance don’t look that much different from actual journals. Meanwhile, there are actual journals, the smaller and/or newer ones, that can be rough around the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by an “actual journal”, then? There are perfectly good open-access journals, so we can’t say that the distinction is whether someone has to pay to read it. I’d say that the big distinction is some level of editorial control – and by that, I don’t only mean “Just a proportion of the papers make it in”, although that’s often the case. Even in more wide-open journals such as &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, papers are reviewed to make sure that they appear to be technically sound (they just don’t make calls on a paper’s impact or importance), and the same goes for many of the other respectable open-access titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings up another criterion: a real journal has some care for what it publishes. A fake or predatory journal, though, does not give a damn. Their reason to exist is to publish as many manuscripts as they can get and collect the payments for them, and if those manuscripts are faked, incoherent, or plagiarized? &lt;em&gt;Oh well.&lt;/em&gt; Did the payment clear? All right, then. Plenty of other journals and their publishers are trying to make money – and how – but their method of doing so runs through some variation of “Attain and preserve some level of respect from the readers and authors”. That’s as opposed to “Shear those sheep and keep the line moving”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to publish everything that comes in the door and maintain that respect, because the stuff that comes in that door is seriously contaminated with garbage. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/004641.html&quot;&gt;Here’s a famous post&lt;/a&gt; from the science-fiction publishing world, from editor Theresa Nielsen Hayden, called “Slushkiller”, about what comes in the transom where she works. About 70% of the submissions can be dismissed out of hand, usually within seconds, because the writing is &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; disjointed or incoherent. Another 25% of the stuff is written reasonably competently, but has a totally overused or borrowed plotline or has some other such flaw that would make it unsaleable. Now you’re down to the last five per cent or so, which is where the real editorial decisions actually start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific publishing is not as different as one might hope. I don’t know how many green-ink religious revelation manuscripts &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; get, but I’ll bet its a nonzero number. There are surely a lot of papers that come in written in such a disorganized manner that they cannot even be reviewed. Beyond that, there are many, many manuscripts that are readable and apparently not wrong, but are still not right for the journal they’ve been submitted to (often because of those impact and importance factors, which is where &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, etc. come in). &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, for example, has said that it rejects about 60% of submitted manuscripts without review, so although the proportion is a bit better than it was at Tor Books, it still means that a solid majority of all submissions don’t even clear the first hurdle of editorial attention. &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, for its part, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/15/plos-one-faced-decline-submissions-new-editor-speaks/&quot;&gt;said recently&lt;/a&gt; that it ends up rejecting about 50% of its submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast with a predatory journal could not be greater. They can, and do, publish whatever gibberish comes in, as long as the money is good, while all the time pretending to be what they are not. Editorial attention of any type is incompatible with their business model. That, to me, is the difference, and that is why these journals must be shunned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a736fc1d</fingerprint><crawled>1522679455660</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><title>Predation</title><description>“Beall’s List”, as a way to keep track of predatory publishers, has been officially offline for some time now.

The tumor suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in human breast cancer and is a marker for poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Transplantation of p53 null mouse mammary epithelium into syngeneic wild-type mice leads to normal mammary gland development followed by spontaneous mammary tumors that recapitulate many of the phenotypic, molecular and genetic features of human breast cancer. Transient exposure of p53 null mice to the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen leads to sustained and robust protection against tumor development. However the mechanism underlying this anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that transient exposure to tamoxifen leads to a reduction in mammary ductal side-branching and epithelial cell proliferation after tamoxifen withdrawal. Global gene expression analysis showed that transient tamoxifen exposure leads to persistent changes in the expression of a subset of estrogen regulated gene signatures in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Among these was the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 5 (&lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt;). We show that &lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt; is a novel tamoxifen regulated target gene which is upregulated in MECs after transient tamoxifen exposure and displays tumor suppressor activity in human breast cancer cells. Further, PTPN5 expression is strongly associated with good clinical outcome in tamoxifen treated human breast cancer patients suggesting that PTPN5 may represent a novel biomarker of tamoxifen response in human breast cancer.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194913</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>33265d5b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Murugesan Palaniappan, David Edwards, Chad J.

It’s from the IBM Zürich group that has pioneered so much work in this area. Over just the time I’ve been writing this blog, that idea has gone from “Maybe someday” to “In some well-defined &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/09/03/real_molecules&quot;&gt;test cases&lt;/a&gt;” to “A few real-world examples known”, and now perhaps to “Hey, this might actually start working”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it’s not just AFM. There’s also scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), among other even more exotic ideas, and together you can get information that simply cannot be obtained by any other methods. Here they are in that order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFM is done typically by picking up a single CO molecule (from the carbon end) with the tip of the metal probe and scanning with the oxygen end across an adsorbed molecule (at liquid helium temperatures) at a constant height, about 4 Angstroms over the molecule itself. Often you go back and scan at several different tip heights. There are many other possible tips – xenon atoms, other diatomic molecules, halogen atoms, and so on. The cantilever holding the tip is oscillating (over about half an Angstrom) at a high frequency, and changes in this, induced by interactions with the molecule under study, are what get measured out (along with deflections in the angle that the CO molecule makes with the surface).  The mechanism for these changes is just flat-out Pauli repulsion for the most part – electrons not wanting to occupy the same volume of space and getting out of each other’s way – although van der Waals and electrostatic forces can show up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPFM is pretty similar, except the readout is the voltage dependence of the position of the tip relative to the molecule, rather than changes in frequency of oscillation. You pick a voltage that gives you good signal/noise and scan around as with AFM. In practice, that gives you more of a pure electrostatic read on the surface, and it’s very useful for determining charge states and electron density in the sample. For example, fluorine is very close to the size of hydrogen, but they look dramatically different in KPFM because of the mass of electrons around the F atoms. Interpretation of the data, though, is not very straightforward, and often seems to involve matching up the experimental results to various calculations to try to see what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, in STM you apply a voltage to the tip and measure the changes in electric current between the tip and the sample as you scan, often by having the tip height change to keep a constant current level. At these distances, electrons are tunneling right across the gap, so this is sheer quantum mechanics all the way. If you pick the appropriate voltage, electrons can be temporarily attached to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the test molecule (or detached from the highest-occupied, the HOMO, if you flip the voltage around), and the resulting images are absolutely &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt; for someone like me who came up thinking of these as mathematical abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At right is an example of these, with a CO tip used to show the bonds in the graphene-like molecule and then (in STM mode), its LUMO. As you can see, the resolution on these experiments is getting pretty good, and allows for an unequivocal assignment of the structure. Of course, an X-ray structure determination would almost certainly nail that down, too, but for that you have to have a purified sample and a good crystal. One interesting thing about AFM-type techniques is that you can scatter a mixed sample across the surface and take a look at the various things that might be in it, one molecule at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At right is an illustration of something else that can really only be done under AFM conditions: actual atomic-level manipulation of the sample. Individual atoms can be pushed, twanged, or (as in this case) removed entirely. The result can be highly reactive intermediates (radicals, arynes, etc.) that can be studied directly at the liquid-helium temperatures involved. There are also opportunities to do on-surface reaction by heating followed by cooling down to AFM conditions, through photochemistry, etc. You can also study the interaction of individual molecules with each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it has to be said that there are not very many labs that are capable of these things at the moment, but that’s changing with the advent of more commercial apparatus and the spread of experienced workers in the field. What’s lacking? As the authors note, there’s a real need for techniques that might be able to read out functional groups and elements more directly. An even bigger challenge is that all the most spectacular results to date have been on planar or near-planar molecules, since these yield the most (and the most interpretable) data. You’re running your quantum fingers over the surface of things here, so the inside of a folded-up conformation is just not going to be available. And finally, there need to be improvements in the time it takes to get a measurement. It’s been stuck at roughly ten-minutes-per-molecule for a long time, but better time resolution would allow for a lot of new things to be picked up (and for better characterization of mixtures, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, an increasing popularity of marathons has been seen. Although running has been shown to have considerable positive health effects, the risk of sudden death, most often due to sudden cardiac arrests, is also a risk runners expose themselves to. Whilst there are some studies on the mortality amongst long-distance runners, much of the evidence is dated. Given the increased popularity in running during the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century as well as the improvements in medical care at marathons, more knowledge is required on the mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and method &lt;p&gt;Publicly available racing and news databases were used to identify the number of entrants and finishers in half to full marathons in Sweden between 2007 and 2016 and the number of deaths that occurred in conjunction with the races.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,156,271 runners entered a long distance (21-42km) running race in Sweden between 2007 and 2016, and 834,412 runners finished the races (72.2%). A large majority of the finishers (677,050 (81%)) competed in distances under a full marathon. Two deaths occurred during the time period, meaning that the death rate was 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.04–0.79) per 100,000 finishers.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study can show that death rates in long distance running races between 2007 and 2016 in Sweden are very low, compared to previous studies. When added to the existing literature, the combined picture suggests a general downward trend in the risk of death during marathons since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195626</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7183bd96</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Finn Nilson, Mats Börjesson&lt;/p&gt;

Iron plays vital roles in the human body including enzymatic processes, oxygen-transport via hemoglobin and immune response. Iron metabolism is characterized by ~95% recycling and minor replenishment through diet. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a lack of synthesis of erythropoietin leading to reduced red blood cell (RBC) formation and aberrant iron recycling. Treatment of CKD anemia aims to normalize RBC count and serum hemoglobin. Clinically, the various fluxes of iron transport and accumulation are not measured so that changes during disease (e.g., CKD) and treatment are unknown. Unwanted iron accumulation in patients is known to lead to adverse effects. Current whole-body models lack the mechanistic details of iron transport related to RBC maturation, transferrin (Tf and TfR) dynamics and assume passive iron efflux from macrophages. Hence, they are not predictive of whole-body iron dynamics and cannot be used to design individualized patient treatment. For prediction, we developed a mechanistic, multi-scale computational model of whole-body iron metabolism incorporating four compartments containing major pools of iron and RBC generation process. The model accounts for multiple forms of iron &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, mechanisms involved in iron uptake and release and their regulation. Furthermore, the model is interfaced with drug pharmacokinetics to allow simulation of treatment dynamics. We calibrated our model with experimental and clinical data from peer-reviewed literature to reliably simulate CKD anemia and the effects of current treatment involving combination of epoietin-alpha and iron dextran. This &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; whole-body model of iron metabolism predicts that a year of treatment can potentially lead to 90% downregulation of ferroportin (FPN) levels, 15-fold increase in iron stores with only a 20% increase in iron flux from the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Model simulations quantified unmeasured iron fluxes, previously unknown effects of treatment on FPN-level and iron stores in the RES. This mechanistic whole-body model can be the basis for future studies that incorporate iron metabolism together with related clinical experiments. Such an approach could pave the way for development of effective personalized treatment of CKD anemia.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mfiym6I-5Rs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joydeep Sarkar, Alka A.

GDSL lipase (GLIP) plays a pivotal role in plant cell growth as a multifunctional hydrolytic enzyme. Herein, a cotton (&lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; L. cv Xuzhou 142) GDSL lipase gene (&lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;) was obtained from developing ovules and fibers. The &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,143 base pairs (bp) and encodes a putative polypeptide of 380 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment indicated that GhGLIP includes four enzyme catalytic amino acid residue sites of Ser (S), Gly (G), Asn (N) and His (H), located in four conserved blocks. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that GhGLIP belongs to the typical class IV lipase family with potential functions in plant secondary metabolism. Subcellular distribution analysis demonstrated that GhGLIP localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm and plasma membrane. &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; was expressed predominantly at 5–15 day post anthesis (dpa) in developing ovules and elongating fibers, measured as mRNA levels and enzyme activity. Ectopic overexpression of &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; in Arabidopsis plants resulted in enhanced seed development, including length and fresh weight. Meanwhile, there was increased soluble sugar and protein storage in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, coupled with the promotion of lipase activity. Moreover, the expression of cotton &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; is induced by ethylene (ETH) treatment &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. A 1,954-bp &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; promoter was isolated and expressed high activity in driving green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression in tobacco leaves. &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting element analysis of the &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; promoter (&lt;i&gt;pGhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;) indicated the presence of an ethylene-responsive element (ERE), and transgenic tobacco leaves with ectopic expression of &lt;i&gt;pGhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP-GUS&lt;/i&gt; showed increased GUS activity after ETH treatment. In summary, these results suggest that GhGLIP is a functional enzyme involved in ovule and fiber development and performs significant roles in seed development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195556</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>66975b42</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rendi Ma, Hali Yuan, Jing An, Xiaoyun Hao, Hongbin Li&lt;/p&gt;

Control and synchronization of fractional-order chaotic systems have attracted wide attention due to their numerous potential applications. To get suitable control method and parameters for fractional-order chaotic systems, the stability analysis of time-varying fractional-order systems should be discussed in the first place. Therefore, this paper analyzes the stability of the time-varying fractional-order systems and presents a stability theorem for the system with the order 0&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;1. This theorem is a sufficient condition which can discriminate the stability of time-varying systems conveniently. Feedback controllers are designed for control and synchronization of the fractional-order Lü chaotic system.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by enhanced pulmonary vascular resistance, which causes right ventricle (RV) pressure overload and results in right sided heart failure and death. This work investigated the effectiveness of a combined therapy with PDE5 inhibitor (PDE5i) and a new adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) agonist in mitigating monocrotaline (MCT) induced PH in rats.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An in vitro isobolographic analysis was performed to identify possible synergistic relaxation effect between sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 in rat pulmonary arteries (PAs). In the in vivo experiments, PH was induced in male Wistar rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg MCT. Rats were divided into the following groups: control (saline injection only), MCT + vehicle, MCT + sildenafil, MCT + LASSBio 1359 and MCT + combination of sildenafil and LASSBio 1359. Fourteen days after the MCT injection, rats were treated daily with oral administration of the regimen therapies or vehicle for 14 days. Cardiopulmonary system function and structure were evaluated by echocardiography. RV systolic pressure and PA endothelial function were measured.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Isobolographic analysis showed a synergistic interaction between sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 in rat PAs. Combined therapy with sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 but not monotreatment with low dosages of either sildenafil or LASSBio 1359 ameliorated all of PH related abnormalities in cardiopulmonary function and structure in MCT challenged rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 has a synergistic interaction, suggesting that combined use of these pharmacological targets may be an alternative to improve quality of life and outcomes for PH patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195047</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fbd13b0a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allan K.

In the in vivo experiments, PH was induced in male Wistar rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg MCT. Rats were divided into the following groups: control (saline injection only), MCT + vehicle, MCT + sildenafil, MCT + LASSBio 1359 and MCT + combination of sildenafil and LASSBio 1359. Fourteen days after the MCT injection, rats were treated daily with oral administration of the regimen therapies or vehicle for 14 days. Cardiopulmonary system function and structure were evaluated by echocardiography. RV systolic pressure and PA endothelial function were measured.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Isobolographic analysis showed a synergistic interaction between sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 in rat PAs. Combined therapy with sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 but not monotreatment with low dosages of either sildenafil or LASSBio 1359 ameliorated all of PH related abnormalities in cardiopulmonary function and structure in MCT challenged rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 has a synergistic interaction, suggesting that combined use of these pharmacological targets may be an alternative to improve quality of life and outcomes for PH patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195047</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Allan K.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity after acute coronary syndrome compared to patients without prior multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multicenter prospective cohort study in Switzerland included 5,635 patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome between 2009 and 2014, with a one-year follow-up period. We defined cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity as having at least two prior comorbidities before the index hospitalization. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional models were built to assess the one-year risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, defined as cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke. The final model was adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, tobacco consumption, education, and family history of cardiovascular disease, prescription of high-dose statinsat discharge and use of cardiac rehabilitation after discharge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 3,664 patients (65%) had no multimorbidity, 1,839 (33%) had cardiovascular multimorbidity, 62 (1%) had non-cardiovascular multimorbidity, and 70 (1%) had both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity. The multivariate risk of recurrent cardiovascular events was increased among patients with cardiovascular multimorbidity (hazard ratio (HR) 2.05, 95% CI: 1.54–2.73, p&amp;lt;0.001) and patients with non-cardiovascular multimorbidity (HR 2.57, 95% CI: 1.04–6.35, p = 0.04) compared to patients without multimorbidity. Patients with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity had the highest risk of recurrence with a HR of 5.19, 95% CI: 2.79–9.64, p&amp;lt;0.001, compared to patients without multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Multimorbidity increased by two-fold the risk of cardiovascular events over the year after an acute coronary syndrome.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). Natural killer cell responses play a crucial role in autoimmune disease through innate immunity, in which killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are closely involved. Although the genetic combination of KIRs with their specific HLA class I ligands has been associated with IBD in Caucasians, such KIR-HLA receptor-ligand combinations are not fully understood in the Japanese. We investigated 14 KIR genes along with HLA-Bw and -C ligands in 90 patients with UC and 50 patients with CD and compared them with the characteristics of 325 healthy control subjects. The frequency of HLA-Bw4 was significantly increased in patients with UC (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;; odds ratio [OR] = 3.39) and CD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0065; OR = 2.32) versus controls. The UC group had a significantly higher frequency of KIR2DS3 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024; OR = 1.94) and lower frequency of KIR2DS4 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019; OR = 0.40) and KIR2DL1-HLA-C2 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.035; OR = 0.47). The Tel-A/B haplotype was significantly decreased in UC patients (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0056; OR = 0.49). The frequency of KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 was significantly higher in patients with UC (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 4.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;; OR = 3.12) and CD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0067; OR = 2.30).

The modulatory role of the primary motor cortex (M1), reflected by an inhibitory effect of M1-stimulation on clinical pain, motivated us to deepen our understanding of M1’s role in pain modulation. We used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)-induced virtual lesion (VL) to interrupt with M1 activity during noxious heat pain. We hypothesized that TMS-VL will effect experimental pain ratings. Three VL protocols were applied consisting of single-pulse TMS to transiently interfere with right M1 activity: (1) VL&lt;sub&gt;M1&lt;/sub&gt;- TMS applied to 11 subjects, 20 msec before the individual’s first pain-related M1 peak activation, as determined by source analysis (sLORETA), (2) VL&lt;sub&gt;-50&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 50 ms prior to noxious stimulus onset), and (3) VL&lt;sub&gt;+150&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 150 ms after noxious stimulus onset). Each protocol included 3 conditions (&apos;pain-alone&apos;, &apos; TMS-VL&apos;, and ‘SHAM-VL’), each consisted of 30 noxious heat stimuli. Pain ratings were compared, in each protocol, for TMS-VL vs. SHAM-VL and vs. pain-alone conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance, corrected for multiple comparisons revealed no significant differences in the pain ratings between the different conditions within each protocol. Therefore, our results from this exploratory study suggest that a single pulse TMS-induced VL that is targeted to M1 failed to interrupt experimental pain processing in the specific three stimulation timing examined here.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>228e14c4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lee-Bareket Kisler, Ilan Gurion, Yelena Granovsky, Alon Sinai, Elliot Sprecher, Simone Shamay-Tsoory, Irit Weissman-Fogel&lt;/p&gt;

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from intensive care unit (ICU) patients with (n = 30) and without sepsis (n = 10), and healthy volunteers (n = 15) were isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation.

The severity of disease was assessed by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II.

Anti-drug antibody formation occurs with most biological agents across disease states, but the mechanism by which they are formed is unknown. The formation of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab (AAA) may decrease its therapeutic effects in some patients. HLA alleles have been reported to be associated with autoantibody formation against interferons and other TNF inhibitors, but not adalimumab. We analyzed samples from 634 subjects with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or hidradenitis suppurativa (HS): 37 subjects (17 RA and 20 HS) developed AAA (AAA+) during adalimumab treatment and 597 subjects (348 RA, 249 HS) did not develop AAA (AAA-) during the clinical trials. Using next-generation sequencing-based HLA typing, we identified three protective HLA alleles (HLA-DQB1*05, HLA-DRB1*01,and HLA-DRB1*07) that were less prevalent in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 0.4, 0.25 and 0.28, respectively; and P values: 0.012, 0.012 and 0.018, respectively) and two risk HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*011) that were more abundant in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 2.52, and 2.64, respectively; and P values: 0.006 and 0.019). Similar to the finding of Billiet &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. who found that carriage of the HLA-DRB1*03 allele was more prevalent in those with anti-infliximab antibodies (OR = 3.6, p = 0.002, 95% CI: [1.5,8.6]).), we found HLA-DRB1*03 allele was also more prevalent in anti-adalimumab positive (OR = 2.52, p = 0.006, 95% CI: [1.37,4.63]). The results suggest that specific HLA alleles may play a key role in developing AAAs in RA and HS patients treated with adalimumab.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195325</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e08b35e8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohan Liu, Jacob Degner, Justin Wade Davis, Kenneth B.

Childhood traumas, in the form of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and neglect, are globally widespread and highly prevalent, and associated with a range of subsequent poor health outcomes. This study sought to understand the relationship between physical, sexual and emotional childhood abuse and subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people (18–30) living in urban informal settlements in Durban, South Africa. Data came from self-completed questionnaires amongst 680 women and 677 men comprising the baseline of the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures intervention trial. Men and women were analysed separately. Logistic regression models assessed the relationship between six HIV-risk behaviours and four measures of trauma: the form of trauma, the severity of each trauma, the range of traumas, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Childhood traumas were incredibly prevalent in this population. All childhood traumas were associated with a range of HIV-risk behaviours. This was for the ever/never trauma, as well as the severity of each type of trauma, the range of trauma, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Despite the wider harsh contexts of urban informal settlements, childhood traumas still play a significant role in shaping subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people. Interventions to reduce childhood traumas for populations in informal settlements need to be developed. In addition, trauma focused therapies need to be considered as part of wider HIV-prevention interventions for young adults.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to gain insight into the physiological changes occurring in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) after autogenic drainage (AD). Changes in respiratory system resistance (Rrs), reactance (Xrs), and spirometry were analyzed in adult CF subjects after a single AD physiotherapy session.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective observational study was conducted during the annual check-up of adult CF subjects in stable condition. Spirometry and Rrs and Xrs measurements using the forced oscillations technique at 5, 11, and 19 hertz (Hz) were performed before and 30 min after a 20-min AD session. Control CF subjects were tested at baseline and 50 min without AD. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median [interquartile range].&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty subjects were included in the physiotherapy group (age 29 [25–34] years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 40.3 [30.1–57.9]% predicted) and 11 in the control group (age 31 [28.5–36.5] years, FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 43.6 [31.1–51.9] % predicted). No significant changes in any parameter were observed in the control group. AD modestly but significantly increased the forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (p&amp;lt;0.001). Inspiratory resistance was also significantly improved by AD: Rrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; from 5.74±2.39 to 5.24±2.17 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/L/s, p&amp;lt;0.05; Rrs&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; from 4.83±1.98 to 4.32±1.7 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/L/s, p = 0.003; and Rrs&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; from 4.18 [3.46–5.07] to 3.86 [2.76–4.98] cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/L/s, p&amp;lt;0.001. In contrast, AD had no significant effects on frequency dependence of resistance (Rrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;–Rrs&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;) or expiratory resistance. Inspiratory Xrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, but not ΔXrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (expiratory—inspiratory Xrs), was improved by AD (p&amp;lt;0.05). Moderate correlations were detected between the improvement in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and FVC and inspiratory resistance (r = 0.53, p = 0.005 and r = 0.44, p = 0.02, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A single session of AD improved inspiratory airway resistance, except in the distal airways. The forced oscillations technique provides a new tool for understanding the pathophysiological effects of airway clearance physiotherapy in CF.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195154</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>58461e67</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elliot Wallaert, Thierry Perez, Anne Prevotat, Gregory Reychler, Benoit Wallaert, Olivier Le Rouzic&lt;/p&gt;

In contrast, AD had no significant effects on frequency dependence of resistance (Rrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;–Rrs&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;) or expiratory resistance. Inspiratory Xrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, but not ΔXrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (expiratory—inspiratory Xrs), was improved by AD (p&amp;lt;0.05). Moderate correlations were detected between the improvement in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and FVC and inspiratory resistance (r = 0.53, p = 0.005 and r = 0.44, p = 0.02, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A single session of AD improved inspiratory airway resistance, except in the distal airways. The forced oscillations technique provides a new tool for understanding the pathophysiological effects of airway clearance physiotherapy in CF.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195154</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Elliot Wallaert</name></author><title>The immediate effects of a single autogenic drainage session on ventilatory mechanics in adult subjects with cystic fibrosis</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde23:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195154</link><published>1522357200000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11998</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b11998/20180409/images/medium/jp-2017-119985_0003.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11998&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) have always represented a public health concern in the military, yet most studies rely on self-reports among non-random samples of military populations. In addition, most of the studies exploring STI rates among the military focus on US service members. This paper assesses the prevalence and correlates of STIs in the French military using biomarkers and compares self-reported versus diagnosed STIs.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data are drawn from the COSEMIL study, a national sexual health survey conducted in the French military in 2014 and 2015. A random sample of 784 men and 141 women aged 18–57 years completed a self-administered questionnaire and provided biological samples for STI testing. We used logistic regression modeling to identify the correlates of STI diagnosis and self-reports.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of diagnosed STIs was 4.7% [3.8–5.9], mostly due to &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt;. This rate was four times higher than the 12 months self-reported rate of 1.1% [0.6–2.3]. Reported STI rates were similar among men and women (1.1% &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 1.8%), but diagnosed STI rates were twice as high among females &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; males (10.4% &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 4.1%, p = 0.007). There were significant differences in the determinants of reported &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; diagnosed STIs. In particular, age and sexual orientation were associated with reported STIs, but not with diagnosed STIs. Conversely, STI counseling and depression were associated with STI diagnosis but not with STI reports.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study underlines the need to use biomarkers in population-based surveys, given the differential and substantial underreporting of STIs. Results also highlight the need for programmatic adaptation to address gender inequalities in STI rates, by developing women’s health services in the French military. Addressing such needs not only benefits women but could also serve as a strategy to reduce overall STI rates as most military women have military partners, increasing the risk of internal transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195158</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2a3d4dc5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sandrine Duron, Henri Panjo, Aline Bohet, Christine Bigaillon, Sébastien Sicard, Nathalie Bajos, Jean-Baptiste Meynard, Audrey Mérens, Caroline Moreau&lt;/p&gt;

Echinoderms are capable of asexual reproduction by fission. An individual divides into parts due to changes in the strength of connective tissue of the body wall. The structure of connective tissue and the mechanisms of variations in its strength in echinoderms remain poorly studied. An analysis of transcriptomes of individuals during the process of fission provides a new opportunity to understand the mechanisms of connective tissue mutability. In the holothurian &lt;i&gt;Cladolabes schmeltzii&lt;/i&gt;, we have found a rather complex organization of connective tissue. Transcripts of genes encoding a wide range of structural proteins of extracellular matrix, as well as various proteases and their inhibitors, have been discovered. All these molecules may constitute a part of the mechanism of connective tissue mutability. According to our data, the extracellular matrix of echinoderms is substantially distinguished from that of vertebrates by the lack of elastin, fibronectins, and tenascins. In case of fission, a large number of genes of transcription factors and components of different signaling pathways are expressed. Products of these genes are probably involved in regulation of asexual reproduction, connective tissue mutability, and preparation of tissues for subsequent regeneration. It has been shown that holothurian tensilins are a special group of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which has formed within the class Holothuroidea and is absent from other echinoderms. Our data can serve a basis for the further study of the mechanisms of extracellular matrix mutability, as well as the mechanisms responsible for asexual reproduction in echinoderms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195836</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9dc269e0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Igor Yu.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Variations in the degree of hirsutism among women of different ethnic backgrounds may stem from multiple etiologies. Shorter length of the polymorphic CAG repeats of the &lt;i&gt;androgen receptor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt;) gene may be associated with increased activity of the receptor leading to hirsutism. We hypothesized that there are ethnic differences in the degree of hirsutism that is unrelated to androgen levels among Israeli women, and that the CAG repeats length may contribute to these differences. Anti-androgenic therapies, such as spironolactone, could be suggested if a shorter CAG repeats length is found to affect the difference in the degree of hirsutism between the ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Healthy Israeli Jewish women aged 18–45 years of Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi origin were invited to participate. Hirsutism was assessed using the simplified Ferriman–Gallwey (sFG) score, and serum total testosterone levels were measured as well. The CAG repeats length was determined by PCR. Methylation-sensitive methods were used to detect the fractional activity of each allele, and the weighted mean was calculated for the CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and eight women were recruited (49 Ashkenazi and 59 non-Ashkenazi). The Ashkenazi women had a significantly lower degree of hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), lower mean BMI (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), total testosterone levels (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017), and longer weighted bi-allelic CAG repeats mean (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015) compared to non-Ashkenazi women. For the group as a whole, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of CAG repeats in the &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; gene and the sFG score, while the number of repeats was not related to testosterone levels. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that ethnic origin and the CAG repeats length were the strongest factors affecting hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is a significant difference in the degree of hirsutism between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi women in Israel that is partially explained by CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195046</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>17eb6b10</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naomi Weintrob, Ori Eyal, Meital Slakman, Anat Segev Becker, Galit Israeli, Ofra Kalter-Leibovici, Shay Ben-Shachar&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent genetic cause of intellectual disability. Despite the fact that more than 50 years have passed since the discovery of its genetic aberrations, the exact pathogenesis of the DS phenotype has remained largely unexplained. It was recently hypothesized that the DS pathogenesis involves complex (epi)genetic, molecular and cellular determinants. To date, many reports have addressed epigenetic aberrations associated with DS at different developmental stages/ages and tissue types, but to our best knowledge not in DS newborns. This study aimed to investigate genome-wide methylation patterns in DS newborns compared to non-trisomic newborns.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;We analyzed blood samples obtained from ten newborns with DS and five age-matched non-trisomic newborns. Epigenetic profiles were obtained from extracted DNA using the Illumina Infinium 450K array. Since aberrant blood cell distribution is known to be present in DS, we applied two distinct models: with and without correction for estimated blood cell distribution.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Differentially methylated position (DMP) analysis of the uncorrected model detected 19525 significant hits (51,2% hypomethylated). In the corrected model, we found 121953 significant DMPs (49,8% hypomethylated). Independent of the used model we observed a chromosome 21 dosage effect. Moreover, we detected 46 and 145 differentially methylated regions in the uncorrected and corrected model respectively, both showing hypomethylation overrepresentation. Replication analyses of DMPs and DMRs found by Bacalini &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. (2015) showed a large overlap.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In this study, we found methylation profile differences between DS newborns and controls reflecting a systematically affected epigenetic profile. The observed chromosome 21 dosage effect suggests the involvement of affected essential regulatory factors/regions or altered expression of chromatin modeling enzymes located on chromosome 21. Additional research is necessary to substantiate these hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194938</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8d6b0412</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Henneman, Arjan Bouman, Adri Mul, Lia Knegt, Anne-Marie van der Kevie-Kersemaekers, Nitash Zwaveling-Soonawala, Hanne E.

Nitric oxide (NO) regulates neuronal function and thus is critical for tuning neuronal communication. Mechanisms by which NO modulates protein function and interaction include posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as S-nitrosylation. Importantly, cross signaling between S-nitrosylation and prenylation can have major regulatory potential. However, the exact protein targets and resulting changes in function remain elusive. Here, we interrogated the role of NO-dependent PTMs and farnesylation in synaptic transmission. We found that NO compromises synaptic function at the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in a cGMP-independent manner. NO suppressed release and reduced the size of available vesicle pools, which was reversed by glutathione (GSH) and occluded by genetic up-regulation of GSH-generating and de-nitrosylating glutamate-cysteine-ligase and S-nitroso-glutathione reductase activities. Enhanced nitrergic activity led to S-nitrosylation of the fusion-clamp protein complexin (cpx) and altered its membrane association and interactions with active zone (AZ) and soluble &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive fusion protein Attachment Protein Receptor (SNARE) proteins. Furthermore, genetic and pharmacological suppression of farnesylation and a nitrosylation mimetic mutant of cpx induced identical physiological and localization phenotypes as caused by NO. Together, our data provide evidence for a novel physiological nitrergic molecular switch involving S-nitrosylation, which reversibly suppresses farnesylation and thereby enhances the net-clamping function of cpx. These data illustrate a new mechanistic signaling pathway by which regulation of farnesylation can fine-tune synaptic release.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6OU2NItN4wI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susan W.

Transverse lines, called Harris Lines (HL), osteological markers of recovery from growth arrest episodes, are visible in radiograms of recent and Pleistocene fossil bones. Since on the one hand they mark stressful episodes in life, and on the other are mainly used to trace health fluctuations in prehistoric human communities, I used a cave bear population to check if the processes that could affect the specie’ condition were in any way reflected in the bone structure. 392 bear bones from Bear Cave in Kletno (collection: Department of Palaeozoology, University of Wrocław), dated as 32 100 ±1300 to &gt;49 000 years BP, were radiologically examined. The bones were found in a non-anatomical position; morphological analysis indicated that they belonged to different individuals. HL shadows were observed on 9 tibiae and 3 radii: 8.8% out of the 59 tibiae and 77 radii and 3.1% of all the bones. At least 3 transverse lines were recognised in those cases; the specimens were histologically examined. The bear individuals in question experienced regular malnutrition periods during their ontogeny. Starvation resulting in growth inhibition involved young individuals, aged 1 to 4 years. Juveniles aged 6 months, i.e. before weaning, or younger, showed no signs of nutritional stress. Starvation periods associated with seasonal food deficit were not long or common and had no significant effect on the development and welfare of the species.

There is evidence that altering stress mindset—the belief that stress is enhancing vs. debilitating—can change cognitive, affective and physiological responses to stress. However individual differences in responsiveness to stress mindset manipulations have not been explored. Given the previously established role of catecholamines in both placebo effects and stress, we hypothesized that genetic variation in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines, would moderate responses to an intervention intended to alter participants’ mindsets about stress. Participants (N = 107) were exposed to a stress mindset manipulation (videos highlighting either the enhancing or debilitating effects of stress) prior to engaging in a Trier Social Stress task and subsequent cognitive tasks. The associations of the &lt;i&gt;COMT&lt;/i&gt; rs4680 polymorphism with the effect of stress mindset video manipulations on cognitive and affective responses were examined. Genetic variation at rs4680 modified the effects of stress mindset on affective and cognitive responses to stress. Individuals homozygous for rs4680 low-activity allele (met/met) were responsive to the stress-is-enhancing mindset manipulation as indicated by greater increases in positive affect, improved cognitive functioning, and happiness bias in response to stress. Conversely, individuals homozygous for the high-activity allele (val/val) were not as responsive to the stress mindset manipulation. These results suggest that responses to stress mindset intervention may vary with &lt;i&gt;COMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype. These findings contribute to the understanding of gene by environment interactions for mindset interventions and stress reactivity and therefore warrant further investigations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195883</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c1bbc3e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alia J.

This behavior is not consistent with a clock-type mechanism in the notochord.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301358v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Mango is one of the famous and fifth most important subtropical/tropical fruit crops worldwide with the production centered in India and South-East Asia.

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have remarkable properties: they represent the most abundant cycling cell population in the adult normal brain and they manage to achieve a uniform and constant density throughout the adult brain. This equilibrium is obtained by the interplay of four processes: division, differentiation or death, migration and active self-repulsion. They are also strongly suspected to be at the origin of gliomas, when their equilibrium is disrupted. In this article, we present a model of the dynamics of OPCs, first in a normal tissue. This model is based on a cellular automaton and its rules are mimicking the ones that regulate the dynamics of real OPCs. The model is able to reproduce the homeostasis of the cell population, with the maintenance of a constant and uniform cell density and the healing of a lesion. We show that there exists a fair quantitative agreement between the simulated and experimental parameters, such as the cell velocity, the time taken to close a lesion, and the duration of the cell cycle. We present three possible scenarios of disruption of the equilibrium: the appearance of an over-proliferating cell, of a deadless/non-differentiating cell, or of a cell that lost any contact-inhibition. We show that the appearance of an over-proliferating cell is sufficient to trigger the growth of a tumor that has low-grade glioma features: an invasive behaviour, a linear radial growth of the tumor with a corresponding growth velocity of less than 2 mm per year, as well a cell density at the center which exceeds the one in normal tissue by a factor of less than two. The loss of contact inhibition leads to a more high-grade-like glioma. The results of our model contribute to the body of evidence that identify OPCs as possible cells of origin of gliomas.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4yhFdqGpIbo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aloys Dufour, Emilie Gontran, Christophe Deroulers, Pascale Varlet, Johan Pallud, Basile Grammaticos, Mathilde Badoual&lt;/p&gt;

The peregrine falcon &lt;i&gt;Falco peregrinus&lt;/i&gt; is renowned for attacking its prey from high altitude in a fast controlled dive called a stoop. Many other raptors employ a similar mode of attack, but the functional benefits of stooping remain obscure. Here we investigate whether, when, and why stooping promotes catch success, using a three-dimensional, agent-based modeling approach to simulate attacks of falcons on aerial prey. We simulate avian flapping and gliding flight using an analytical quasi-steady model of the aerodynamic forces and moments, parametrized by empirical measurements of flight morphology. The model-birds’ flight control inputs are commanded by their guidance system, comprising a phenomenological model of its vision, guidance, and control. To intercept its prey, model-falcons use the same guidance law as missiles (pure proportional navigation); this assumption is corroborated by empirical data on peregrine falcons hunting lures. We parametrically vary the falcon’s starting position relative to its prey, together with the feedback gain of its guidance loop, under differing assumptions regarding its errors and delay in vision and control, and for three different patterns of prey motion. We find that, when the prey maneuvers erratically, high-altitude stoops increase catch success compared to low-altitude attacks, but only if the falcon’s guidance law is appropriately tuned, and only given a high degree of precision in vision and control. Remarkably, the optimal tuning of the guidance law in our simulations coincides closely with what has been observed empirically in peregrines. High-altitude stoops are shown to be beneficial because their high airspeed enables production of higher aerodynamic forces for maneuvering, and facilitates higher roll agility as the wings are tucked, each of which is essential to catching maneuvering prey at realistic response delays.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ypEvewr7kSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robin Mills, Hanno Hildenbrandt, Graham K.

Pooled DNA from multiple unknown organisms arises in a variety of contexts, for example microbial samples from ecological or human health research. Determining the composition of pooled samples can be difficult, especially at the scale of modern sequencing data and reference databases. Here we propose a novel method for taxonomic profiling in pooled DNA that combines the speed and low-memory requirements of k-mer based pseudoalignment with a likelihood framework that uses base quality information to better resolve multiply mapped reads. We apply the method to the problem of classifying 16S rRNA reads using a reference database of known organisms, a common challenge in microbiome research. Using simulations, we show the method is accurate across a variety of read lengths, with different length reference sequences, at different sample depths, and when samples contain reads originating from organisms absent from the reference. We also assess performance in real 16S data, where we reanalyze previous genetic association data to show our method discovers a larger number of quantitative trait associations than other widely used methods. We implement our method in the software Karp, for k-mer based analysis of read pools, to provide a novel combination of speed and accuracy that is uniquely suited for enhancing discoveries in microbial studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3dI4mAo5X0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mark Reppell, John Novembre&lt;/p&gt;

While food losses (foods which were intended for human consumption, but which ultimately are not directly eaten by people) have been included in animal feed for millennia, the practice is all but banned in the European Union. Amid recent calls to promote a circular economy, we conducted a survey of pig farmers (n = 82) and other agricultural stakeholders (n = 81) at a UK agricultural trade fair on their attitudes toward the use of food losses in pig feed, and the potential relegalisation of swill (the use of cooked food losses as feed). While most respondents found the use of feeds containing animal by-products or with the potential for intra-species recycling (i.e. pigs eating pork products) to be less acceptable than feeds without, we found strong support (&gt;75%) for the relegalisation of swill among both pig farmers and other stakeholders. We fit multi-hierarchical Bayesian models to understand people’s position on the relegalisation of swill, finding that respondents who were concerned about disease control and the perception of the pork industry supported relegalisation less, while people who were concerned with farm financial performance and efficiency or who thought that swill would benefit the environment and reduce trade-deficits, were more supportive. Our results provide a baseline estimate of support amongst the large-scale pig industry for the relegalisation of swill, and suggest that proponents for its relegalisation must address concerns about disease control and the consumer acceptance of swill-fed pork.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196288</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>25ccf198</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erasmus K.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies are becoming routinely used for the detection of novel and clinically actionable DNA variants at a pangenomic scale. Such analyses are now used in the clinical practice to enable precision medicine. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are still one of the most abundant source of cancer clinical specimen, unfortunately this method of preparation is known to degrade DNA and therefore compromise subsequent analysis. Some studies have reported that variant detection can be performed on FFPE samples sequenced with NGS techniques, but few or none have done an in-depth coverage analysis and compared the influence of different state-of-the-art FFPE DNA extraction kits on the quality of the variant calling. Here, we generated 42 human whole-exome sequencing data sets from fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE samples. These samples include normal and tumor tissues from two different organs (liver and colon), that we extracted with three different FFPE extraction kits (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and GeneRead DNA FFPE kit from Qiagen, Maxwell&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; RSC DNA FFPE Kit from Promega). We determined the rate of concordance of called variants between matched FF and FFPE samples on all common variants (representing at least 86% of the total number of variants for SNVs). The concordance rate is very high between all matched FF / FFPE pairs, with equivalent values for the three kits we analyzed. On the other hand, when looking at the difference between the total number of variants in FF and FFPE, we find a significant variation for the three different FFPE DNA extraction kits. Coverage analysis shows that FFPE samples have less good indicators than FF samples, yet the coverage quality remains above accepted thresholds. We detect limited but statistically significant variations in coverage indicator values between the three FFPE extraction kits. Globally, the GeneRead and QIAamp kits have better variant calling and coverage indicators than the Maxwell kit on the samples used in this study, although this kit performs better on some indicators and has advantages in terms of practical usage. Taken together, our results confirm the potential of FFPE samples analysis for clinical genomic studies, but also indicate that the choice of a FFPE DNA extraction kit should be done with careful testing and analysis beforehand in order to maximize the accuracy of the results.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195471</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d03d05e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Bonnet, Marie-Laure Moutet, Céline Baulard, Delphine Bacq-Daian, Florian Sandron, Lilia Mesrob, Bertrand Fin, Marc Delépine, Marie-Ange Palomares, Claire Jubin, Hélène Blanché, Vincent Meyer, Anne Boland, Robert Olaso, Jean-François Deleuze&lt;/p&gt;

Taken together, our results confirm the potential of FFPE samples analysis for clinical genomic studies, but also indicate that the choice of a FFPE DNA extraction kit should be done with careful testing and analysis beforehand in order to maximize the accuracy of the results.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195471</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Eric Bonnet</name></author><title>Performance comparison of three DNA extraction kits on human whole-exome data from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal and tumor samples</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d736:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195471</link><published>1522962000000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04435-3</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why fit fathers sire smarter offspring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why fit fathers sire smarter offspring, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04435-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04435-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Mice that hit the running wheel have brainier pups than sedentary rodents do.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04435-3/d41586-018-04435-3_15603110.jpg</url><width>1024</width></visual><crawled>1523549449921</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ca4fc227</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why fit fathers sire smarter offspring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why fit fathers sire smarter offspring, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04435-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04435-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Mice that hit the running wheel have brainier pups than sedentary rodents do.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04435-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><title>Why fit fathers sire smarter offspring</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>190</engagement><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162ba9faec1:f26749:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04435-3</link><published>1523516400000</published></item><item><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0092867418302290%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D7710de7869f2bfe3db0a8adf7c97b805</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418302290</canonicalUrl><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>375</height><url>http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0092867418302290-fx1.jpg</url><width>375</width></visual><crawled>1523662580928</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell</title><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/7051</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1af59f6a</fingerprint><description>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell, Volume 173, Issue 2&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Jianfang Liu, Tara Lichtenberg, Katherine A.

Extracting and identifying genetic material from environmental media (i.e. water and soil) presents a unique opportunity for researchers to assess biotic diversity and ecosystem health with increased speed and decreased cost as compared to traditional methods (e.g. trapping). The heterogeneity of soil mineralogy, spatial and temporal variations however present unique challenges to sampling and interpreting results. Specifically, fate/transport of genetic material in the terrestrial environment represents a substantial data gap. Here we investigate to what degree, benthic fauna transport genetic material through soil. Using the red worm (Eisenia fetida), we investigate how natural movement through artificial soil affect the transport of genetic material. All experiments were run in Frabill® Habitat® II worm systems with approximately 5 cm depth of artificial soil. We selected an “exotic” source of DNA not expected to be present in soil, zebrafish (Danio rerio) tissue. Experiment groups contained homogenized zebrafish tissue placed in a defined location combined with a varying number of worms (10, 30 or 50 worms per experimental group). Experimental groups comprised two controls and three treatment groups (representing different worm biomass) in triplicate. A total of 210 soil samples were randomly collected over the course of 15 days to investigate the degree of genetic transfer, and the rate of detection. Positive detections were identified in 14% - 38% of samples across treatment groups, with an overall detection rate of 25%. These findings highlight two important issues when utilizing environmental DNA for biologic assessments. First, benthic fauna are capable of redistributing genetic material through a soil matrix. Second, despite a defined sample container and abundance of worm biomass, as many as 86% of the samples were negative. This has substantial implications for researchers and managers who wish to interpret environmental DNA results from terrestrial systems. Studies such as these will aid in future study protocol design and sample collection methodology.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196430</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9634d2fb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher M.

The macaque is widely accepted as a suitable model for preclinical characterization of dengue vaccine candidates. However, the only vaccine for which both preclinical and clinical efficacy results were reported so far showed efficacy levels that were substantially different between macaques and humans. We hypothesized that this model’s predictive capacity may be improved using recent and minimally passaged dengue virus isolates, and by assessing vaccine efficacy by characterizing not only the post-dengue virus challenge viremia/RNAemia but also the associated-cytokine profile. Ten recent and minimally passaged Brazilian clinical isolates from the four dengue virus serotypes were tested for their infectivity in rhesus macaques. For the strains showing robust replication capacity, the associated-changes in soluble mediator levels, and the elicited dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses, were also characterized. Three isolates from dengue virus serotypes 1, 2 and 4 induced viremia of high magnitude and longer duration relative to previously reported viremia kinetics in this model, and robust dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses. Consistent with observations in humans, increased MCP-1, IFN-γ and VEGF-A levels, and transiently decreased IL-8 levels were detected after infection with the selected isolates. These results may contribute to establishing a dengue macaque model showing a higher predictability for vaccine efficacy in humans.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196311</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a848de53</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Beatriz Borges, Renato Sergio Marchevsky, Ygara S.

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction following left ventricular (LV) failure is associated with poor prognosis. RV remodeling is thought initiated by the increase in the afterload of RV due to secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) to impaired LV function; however, RV molecular changes might occur in earlier stages of the disease. cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)-phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, widely used to treat PH through their pulmonary vasorelaxation properties, have shown direct cardiac benefits, but their impacts on the RV in LV diseases are not fully determined. Here we show that RV molecular alterations occur early in the absence of RV hemodynamic changes during LV pressure-overload and are ameliorated by PDE5 inhibition. Two-day moderate LV pressure-overload (transverse aortic constriction) neither altered RV pressure/ function nor RV weight in mice, while it induced only mild LV hypertrophy. Importantly, pathological molecular features were already induced in the RV free wall myocardium, including up-regulation of gene markers for hypertrophy and inflammation, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and calcineurin. Concomitant PDE5 inhibition (sildenafil) prevented induction of such pathological genes and activation of ERK and calcineurin in the RV as well as in the LV. Importantly, dexamethasone also prevented these RV molecular changes, similarly to sildenafil treatment. These results suggest the contributory role of inflammation to the early pathological interventricular interaction between RV and LV. The current study provides the first evidence for the novel early molecular cross-talk between RV and LV, preceding RV hemodynamic changes in LV disease, and supports the therapeutic strategy of enhancing cGMP signaling pathway to treat heart diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195528</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>727a0802</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yousuke Imai, Taro Kariya, Masaki Iwakiri, Yoshitsugu Yamada, Eiki Takimoto&lt;/p&gt;

The hemodynamic effects of intravenous (IV) paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are unknown. We performed a prospective single center placebo controlled randomized study with parallel group design in adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Participants received paracetamol (1 gram) IV or placebo (an equal volume of 0.9% saline) preoperatively followed by two postoperative doses 6 hours apart. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in systolic (SBP) 30 minutes after the preoperative infusion, analysed using an ANCOVA model. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic blood pressure (DPB), and other key hemodynamic variables after each infusion. All other endpoints were analysed using random-effect generalized least squares regression modelling with individual patients treated as random effects. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to receive paracetamol (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). Post preoperative infusion, paracetamol decreased SBP by a mean (SD) of 13 (18) mmHg, p = 0.02, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (11) mmHg with saline. Paracetamol decreased MAP and DBP by a mean (SD) of 9 (12) mmHg and 8 (9) mmHg (p = 0.01 and 0.02), respectively, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (8) mmHg and 0 (6) mmHg with placebo. Postoperatively, there were no significant differences in pressure or flow based hemodynamic parameters in both groups. This study provides high quality evidence that the administration of IV paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery causes a transient decrease in preoperative blood pressure when administered before surgery but no adverse hemodynamic effects when administered in the postoperative setting.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195931</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ac938260</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth Chiam, Rinaldo Bellomo, Leonid Churilov, Laurence Weinberg&lt;/p&gt;

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-1 family with multiple context dependent functions. We and others have shown that HIV infection is accompanied by increased circulating levels of IL-18 along with decreased levels of its antagonist, Interleukin-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP). The infection is also accompanied by intestinal inflammation and decreased intestinal integrity as measured by intestinal permeability, regeneration and repair. However, little is known concerning the relation between high level of IL-18 associated with the viral infection and intestinal permeability. Here we demonstrate that HIV treatment increases production of IL-18 and decreases that of IL-18BP production in human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines. IL-18 causes apoptosis of the IEC by activating caspase-1 and caspase-3. It induces epithelial barrier hyperpermeability by decreasing and disrupting both tight and adherens junction proteins, occludin, claudin 2 and beta-catenin. Disorganization of F-actin was also observed in the IEC that were exposed to the cytokine. Moreover IL-18 decreases transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in Caco-2 and increases permeability in HT29 monolayers. The cells’ treatment with IL-18 causes an increase in the expression of phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light-chain (p-MLC) and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and a decrease in phosphorylated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (p-STAT)-5. This increase in p-MLC is suppressed by a Rho-kinase (ROCK)-specific inhibitor. Interestingly, the levels of the cytokine correlate with those of LPS in the circulation in three different categories of HIV infected patients (HAART-naïve and HAART-treated HIV-infected individuals, and Elite controls) as well as in healthy controls. Collectively, these results suggest that the HIV-induced IL-18 plays a role in increased intestinal permeability and microbial translocation observed in HIV-infected individuals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194185</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>cb164de5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ossama Allam, Suzanne Samarani, Vikram Mehraj, Mohammad-Ali Jenabian, Cecile Tremblay, Jean-Pierre Routy, Devendra Amre, Ali Ahmad&lt;/p&gt;

The use of cocoa pod husk hemicellulose hydrolysate (CPHHH) was evaluated for the production of xylitol by &lt;i&gt;Candida boidinii&lt;/i&gt; XM02G yeast isolated from soil of cocoa-growing areas and decaying bark, as an alternative means of reusing this type of waste. Xylitol was obtained in concentrations of 11.34 g.L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to a yield (Y&lt;sub&gt;p/s&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.52 g.g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; with a fermentation efficiency (ε) of 56.6%. The yeast was tolerant to inhibitor compounds present in CPHHH without detoxification in different concentration factors, and was able to tolerate phenolic compounds at approximately 6 g.L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The yeast was also able to metabolize more than 99% (p/v) of furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural present in the non-detoxified CPHHH without extension of the cell-growth lag phase, showing the potential of this microorganism for the production of xylitol.

Xylitol was obtained in concentrations of 11.34 g.L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to a yield (Y&lt;sub&gt;p/s&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.52 g.g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; with a fermentation efficiency (ε) of 56.6%. The yeast was tolerant to inhibitor compounds present in CPHHH without detoxification in different concentration factors, and was able to tolerate phenolic compounds at approximately 6 g.L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The yeast was also able to metabolize more than 99% (p/v) of furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural present in the non-detoxified CPHHH without extension of the cell-growth lag phase, showing the potential of this microorganism for the production of xylitol. The fermentation of cocoa pod husk hydrolysates appears to provide an alternative use which may reduce the impact generated by incorrect disposal of this waste.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195206</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Nivio Batista Santana</name></author><title>Production of xylitol and bio-detoxification of cocoa pod husk hemicellulose hydrolysate by &amp;lt;i&gt;Candida boidinii&amp;lt;/i&gt; XM02G</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523480400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd85:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195206</link><published>1523480400000</published></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302604v2?rss=1</originId><content><content>Background: Cohesive visualization and interpretation of hyperdimensional, large-scale -omics data is an ongoing challenge, particularly for biologists and clinicians involved in current highly complex sequencing studies.

PRESTO detected gene networks from the natural variations among mouse macrophages and human blood leukocytes. We applied PRESTO to clinical transcriptomic and proteomic data from large patient cohorts and detected disease-defining signatures in antibody-mediated kidney transplant rejection, renal cell carcinoma, and relapsing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In AML, PRESTO confirmed a previously described gene signature and found a new signature of 10 genes that is highly predictive of patient outcome.

While there is substantial evidence that adults who violate gender stereotypes often face backlash (i.e. social and economic penalties), less is known about the nature of gender stereotypes for young children, and the penalties that children may face for violating them. We conducted three experiments, with over 2000 adults from the US, to better understand the content and consequences of adults’ gender stereotypes for young children. In Experiment 1, we tested which characteristics adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 635) believed to be descriptive (i.e. typical), prescriptive (i.e. required), and proscriptive (i.e. forbidden) for preschool-aged boys and girls.

Experiment 2 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 697) revealed that adults rated stereotype-violating children as less likeable than their stereotype-conforming peers, and that this difference was more robust for boys than girls.

While there is substantial evidence that adults who violate gender stereotypes often face backlash (i.e. social and economic penalties), less is known about the nature of gender stereotypes for young children, and the penalties that children may face for violating them. We conducted three experiments, with over 2000 adults from the US, to better understand the content and consequences of adults’ gender stereotypes for young children. In Experiment 1, we tested which characteristics adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 635) believed to be descriptive (i.e. typical), prescriptive (i.e. required), and proscriptive (i.e. forbidden) for preschool-aged boys and girls. Using the characteristics that were rated in Experiment 1, we then constructed vignettes that were either ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’, and manipulated whether the vignettes were said to describe a boy or a girl. Experiment 2 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 697) revealed that adults rated stereotype-violating children as less likeable than their stereotype-conforming peers, and that this difference was more robust for boys than girls. Experiment 3 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 731) was a direct replication of Experiment 2, and revealed converging evidence of backlash against stereotype-violating children. In sum, our results suggest that even young children encounter backlash from adults for stereotype violations, and that these effects may be strongest for boys.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195503</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jessica Sullivan</name></author><title>Backlash against gender stereotype-violating preschool children</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523307600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715290:9aea0a7d</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195503</link><published>1523307600000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01003</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01003/20180326/images/medium/mp-2017-01003s_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01003&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Global introductions of aquatic species and their associated pathogens are threatening worldwide biodiversity. The introduction of two North American crayfish species, &lt;i&gt;Procambarus clarkii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pacifastacus leniusculus&lt;/i&gt;, into Japan in 1927 seems to have negatively affected native Japanese crayfish populations of &lt;i&gt;Cambaroides japonicus&lt;/i&gt;. Several studies have shown the decline of these native populations due to competition, predation and habitat colonization by the two invasive North American crayfish species. Here, we identify an additional factor contributing to this decline. We report the first crayfish plague outbreaks in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonicus&lt;/i&gt; populations in Japan, which were diagnosed using both histological and molecular approaches (analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region). Subsequent analyses of the mitochondrial ribosomal rnnS and rnnL regions of diseased specimens indicate that these outbreaks originated from a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt; population and identify a novel haplotype of &lt;i&gt;Aphanomyces astaci&lt;/i&gt;, d3-haplotype, hosted by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt;. Overall, our findings demonstrate the first two cases of crayfish plague in Japan, and the first case in a non-European native crayfish species, which originated from the red swamp crayfish &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;Diagnosing HIV and/or TB is not sufficient; linkage to care and treatment is conditional to reduce the burden of disease. This study aimed to determine factors associated with linkage to HIV care and TB treatment at community-based services in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized routinely collected data from clients who utilized stand-alone (fixed site not attached to a health facility) and mobile HIV testing services in eight communities in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan district, between January 2008 and June 2012. Clients were included in the analysis if they were ≥12 years and had a known HIV status. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were used to assess the association between determinants (sex, age, HIV testing service and co-infection status) and self-reported linkage to HIV care and/or TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Linkage to HIV care was 3 738/5 929 (63.1%). Linkage to HIV care was associated with the type of HIV testing service. Clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services had a significantly reduced odds of linking to HIV care (aOR 0.7 (CI 95%: 0.6–0.8), p&amp;lt;0.001. Linkage to TB treatment was 210/275 (76.4%). Linkage to TB treatment was not associated with sex and service type, but was associated with age. Clients in older age groups were less likely to link to TB treatment compared to clients in the age group 12–24 years (all, p-value&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A large proportion of clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services did not link to care.

Studies disrupting the chemokine pathway CX3CL1 (fractalkine)/ CX3CR1 have shown decreased atherosclerosis in animal models but the techniques used to interrupt the pathway have not been easily translatable into human trials. DNA vaccination potentially overcomes the translational difficulties. We evaluated the effect of a DNA vaccine, targeted to CX3CR1, on atherosclerosis in a murine model and examined possible mechanisms of action. DNA vaccination against CX3CR1, enhanced by dendritic cell targeting using DEC-205 single chain variable region fragment (scFv), was performed in 8 week old ApoE-/- mice, fed a normal chow diet. High levels of anti-CX3CR1 antibodies were induced in vaccinated mice. There were no apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine. Arterial vessels of 34 week old mice were examined histologically for atherosclerotic plaque size, macrophage infiltration, smooth muscle cell infiltration and lipid deposition. Vaccinated mice had significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque in the brachiocephalic artery. There was less macrophage infiltration but no significant change to the macrophage phenotype in the plaques. There was less lipid deposition in the lesions, but there was no effect on smooth muscle cell migration. Targeted DNA vaccination to CX3CR1 was well tolerated, induced a strong immune response and resulted in attenuated atherosclerotic lesions with reduced macrophage infiltration. DNA vaccination against chemokine pathways potentially offers a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195657</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4cb30a82</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jimmy Jianheng Zhou, Yuan Min Wang, Vincent W.

DNA vaccination against chemokine pathways potentially offers a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195657</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jimmy Jianheng Zhou</name></author><title>DEC205-DC targeted DNA vaccine against CX3CR1 protects against atherogenesis in mice</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523480400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3c9:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195657</link><published>1523480400000</published></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Synthesis_and_Biological_Evaluation_of_the_Antimicrobial_Natural_Product_Lipoxazolidinone_A/6103607</originId><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><crawled>1523290830036</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8a7cf494</fingerprint><description>The lipoxazolidinone family of marine natural products, with an unusual 4-oxazolidinone heterocycle at their core, represents a new scaffold for antimicrobial discovery; however, questions regarding their mechanism of action and high lipophilicity have likely slowed follow-up studies.

In medicine, diagnoses based on medical test results are probabilistic by nature. Unfortunately, cognitive illusions regarding the statistical meaning of test results are well documented among patients, medical students, and even physicians. There are two effective strategies that can foster insight into what is known as Bayesian reasoning situations: (1) translating the statistical information on the prevalence of a disease and the sensitivity and the false-alarm rate of a specific test for that disease from probabilities into natural frequencies, and (2) illustrating the statistical information with tree diagrams, for instance, or with other pictorial representation. So far, such strategies have only been empirically tested in combination for “1-test cases”, where one binary hypothesis (“disease” vs. “no disease”) has to be diagnosed based on one binary test result (“positive” vs. “negative”). However, in reality, often more than one medical test is conducted to derive a diagnosis. In two studies, we examined a total of 388 medical students from the University of Regensburg (Germany) with medical “2-test scenarios”. Each student had to work on two problems: diagnosing breast cancer with mammography and sonography test results, and diagnosing HIV infection with the ELISA and Western Blot tests. In Study 1 (N = 190 participants), we systematically varied the presentation of statistical information (“only textual information” vs. “only tree diagram” vs. “text and tree diagram in combination”), whereas in Study 2 (N = 198 participants), we varied the kinds of tree diagrams (“complete tree” vs. “highlighted tree” vs. “pruned tree”). All versions were implemented in probability format (including probability trees) and in natural frequency format (including frequency trees). We found that natural frequency trees, especially when the question-related branches were highlighted, improved performance, but that none of the corresponding probabilistic visualizations did.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195029</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>272c294d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karin Binder, Stefan Krauss, Georg Bruckmaier, Jörg Marienhagen&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Loss to care is high among asymptomatic HIV-infected women initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. However, whether pregnancy itself plays a role in the high loss to care rate is uncertain. We compared loss to care over seven years between pregnant and non-pregnant women at enrollment into HIV care in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective analysis of all ART-naive women aged 15–45 initiating HIV care at two large clinics in Kinshasa, DRC, from 2007–2013. Pregnancy status was recorded at care enrollment. Patients were classified as having no follow-up if they did not return to care after the initial enrollment visit. Among those with at least one follow-up visit after enrollment, we classified patients as lost to care if more than 365 days had passed since their last clinic visit. We used logistic regression to model the association between pregnancy status and no follow-up, and Cox proportional hazards regression to model the association between pregnancy status and time to loss to care.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2175 women included in the analysis, 1497 (68.8%) were pregnant at enrollment. Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were less likely to be over 35 years of age (19.1% vs. 31.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and less likely to be in WHO stage III or IV (9.0% vs. 26.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Among pregnant women, 106 (7.1%) were not seen after enrollment, versus 25 (3.7%) non-pregnant women (adjusted odds ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.24–3.24). Of the 2,044 women with at least one follow-up visit, 46.5% of pregnant women and 46.7% of non-pregnant women were lost to care by 5 years; hazards of loss to care were similar for pregnant and non-pregnant women (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.93–1.26).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this large cohort of HIV-infected women, patients pregnant at care enrollment were more likely to never return for follow-up. Among those who attended at least one follow-up visit, loss to care was not different between pregnant and non-pregnant women, suggesting that pregnancy itself may not be the main driver of the high attrition observed in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195231</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e9c8c069</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Ross, Andrew Edmonds, Donald R.

The relationship between the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of neural systems is of central importance in brain network science. It is an open question, however, how the SC-FC relationship depends on specific topological features of brain networks or the models used for describing neural dynamics. Using a basic but general model of discrete excitable units that follow a susceptible—excited—refractory activity cycle (SER model), we here analyze how the network activity patterns underlying functional connectivity are shaped by the characteristic topological features of the network. We develop an analytical framework for describing the contribution of essential topological elements, such as common inputs and pacemakers, to the coactivation of nodes, and demonstrate the validity of the approach by comparison of the analytical predictions with numerical simulations of various exemplar networks. The present analytic framework may serve as an initial step for the mechanistic understanding of the contributions of brain network topology to brain dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-BJLyjXZ7qg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arnaud Messé, Marc-Thorsten Hütt, Claus C.

The present analytic framework may serve as an initial step for the mechanistic understanding of the contributions of brain network topology to brain dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-BJLyjXZ7qg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fd8895a0</fingerprint><recrawled>1523306525319</recrawled><crawled>1523296582770</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><title>Toward a theory of coactivation patterns in excitable neural networks</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006084</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/-BJLyjXZ7qg/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Arnaud Messé</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>5</engagement><updated>1523307600000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162ab8d3c72:d9a77:a077e55f</id><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006084</link><published>1523307600000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26158</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Architecture of the human GATOR1 and GATOR1–Rag GTPases complexes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture of the human GATOR1 and GATOR1–Rag GTPases complexes, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26158&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nature26158&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical analyses of the GATOR1 protein complex reveal that two binding modes underpin its ability to regulate Rag GTPases as a GTPase-activating protein for RAGA.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>539</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nature26158-f1.jpg</url><width>685</width></visual><crawled>1522256354648</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>20876514</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Architecture of the human GATOR1 and GATOR1–Rag GTPases complexes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture of the human GATOR1 and GATOR1–Rag GTPases complexes, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26158&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nature26158&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical analyses of the GATOR1 protein complex reveal that two binding modes underpin its ability to regulate Rag GTPases as a GTPase-activating protein for RAGA.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26158</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Kuang Shen</name></author><title>Architecture of the human GATOR1 and GATOR1–Rag GTPases complexes</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>57</engagement><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1626d8c9d58:6c4a591:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26158</link><published>1522220400000</published></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34311</originId><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34311</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524234559201</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e8191982</fingerprint><description>Potent, selective and broadly characterized small molecule modulators of protein function (chemical probes) are powerful research reagents.

Violent acts on university campuses are becoming more frequent. Enrollment rates of Latinos at universities is increasing. Research has indicated that youths are more susceptible to trauma, particularly Latinos. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate the validity of commonly used posttraumatic stress measures among Latino college students. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) is one of the most commonly used metrics of posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. However, it is largely unknown if the IES-R is measuring the same construct across different sub-samples (e.g. Latino versus non-Latino). The current study aimed to assess measurement invariance for the IES-R between Latino and non-Latino participants. A total of 545 participants completed the IES-R. One- and three-factor scoring solutions were compared using confirmatory factor analyses. Measurement invariance was then evaluated by estimating several multiple-group confirmatory factor analytic models. Four models with an increasing degree of invariance across groups were compared. A significant χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; difference test was used to indicate a significant change in model fit between nested models within the measurement invariance testing process. The three-factor scoring solution could not be used for the measurement invariance process because the subscale correlations were too high for estimation (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;s 0.92–1.00). Therefore, the one-factor model was used for the invariance testing process. Invariance was met for each level of invariance: configural, metric, scalar, and strict. All measurement invariance testing results indicated that the one-factor solution for the IES-R was equivalent for the Latino and non-Latino participants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195229</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fc68bb5d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jitske Tiemensma, Sarah Depaoli, Sonja D.

This paper studies the Retailer Stackelberg game in a supply chain consisting of two manufacturers and one retailer where they compete simultaneously under three factors including price, service and simple price discount contract. It is assumed that the second manufacturer provides service directly to his customers, and the retailer provides service for the first product’s customers, while the retailer buys the first product under price discount from the first manufacturer. The analysis of the optimal equilibrium solutions and the results of the numerical examples show that if a manufacturer chooses the appropriate range of discount rate, he will gain more profit than when there is no discount given to the retailer. This situation can be considered as an effective tool for the coordination of the first manufacturer and the retailer to offer discount by manufacturer and to provide the service by the retailer. We obtain equilibrium solution of Retailer Stackelberg game and analyze the numerical examples under two cases: a) the manufacturers sell their products to the retailer without price discount contract. b) The first manufacturer sells his products to the retailer with the simple price discount contract. The preliminary results show that the service and the price discount contract can improve the performance of supply chain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195109</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2adf9807</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seyed Jafar Sadjadi, Hashem Asadi, Ramin Sadeghian, Hadi Sahebi&lt;/p&gt;

Vibrations are important cues for tactile perception across species. Whisker-based sensation in mice is a powerful model system for investigating mechanisms of tactile perception. However, the role vibration plays in whisker-based sensation remains unsettled, in part due to difficulties in modeling the vibration of whiskers. Here, we develop an analytical approach to calculate the vibrations of whiskers striking objects. We use this approach to quantify vibration forces during active whisker touch at a range of locations along the whisker. The frequency and amplitude of vibrations evoked by contact are strongly dependent on the position of contact along the whisker. The magnitude of vibrational shear force and bending moment is comparable to quasi-static forces. The fundamental vibration frequencies are in a detectable range for mechanoreceptor properties and below the maximum spike rates of primary sensory afferents. These results suggest two dynamic cues exist that rodents can use for object localization: vibration frequency and comparison of vibrational to quasi-static force magnitude. These complement the use of quasi-static force angle as a distance cue, particularly for touches close to the follicle, where whiskers are stiff and force angles hardly change during touch. Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oRjfKRlw_io&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Vaxenburg, Isis Wyche, Karel Svoboda, Alexander L.

Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oRjfKRlw_io&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c4a8f063</fingerprint><recrawled>1522182248935</recrawled><crawled>1522172570172</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><title>Dynamic cues for whisker-based object localization: An analytical solution to vibration during active whisker touch</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006032</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/oRjfKRlw_io/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Roman Vaxenburg</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>30</engagement><updated>1522184400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162688e2a3c:4d823:a077e55f</id><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006032</link><published>1522184400000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01795</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01795/20180329/images/medium/jm-2017-01795d_0020.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01795&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Decreased but measurable serum IgA levels (≤70 mg/dL) have been associated with risk for infections in some populations, but are unstudied in COPD. This study tested the hypothesis that subnormal serum IgA levels would be associated with exacerbation risk in COPD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data were analyzed from 1,049 COPD participants from the observational cohort study SPIROMICS (535 (51%) women; mean age 66.1 (SD 7.8), 338 (32%) current smokers) who had baseline serum IgA measured using the Myriad RBM biomarker discovery platform. Exacerbation data was collected prospectively (mean 944.3 (SD 281.3) days), and adjusted linear, logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions were performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean IgA was 269.1 mg/dL (SD 150.9). One individual had deficient levels of serum IgA (&amp;lt;7 mg/dL) and 25 (2.4%) had IgA level ≤70 mg/dL. Participants with IgA ≤70 mg/dL were younger (62 vs. 66 years, p = 0.01) but otherwise similar to those with higher IgA. In adjusted models, IgA ≤70 mg/dL was associated with higher exacerbation incidence rates (IRR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01–2.87, p = 0.044) and greater risk for any severe exacerbation (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.30–6.94, p = 0.010). In adjusted models among those in the lowest decile (&amp;lt;120 mg/dL), each 10 mg/dL decrement in IgA (analyzed continuously) was associated with more exacerbations during follow-up (β 0.24, 95% CI 0.017–0.46, p = 0.035).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Subnormal serum IgA levels were associated with increased risk for acute exacerbations, supporting mildly impaired IgA levels as a contributing factor in COPD morbidity. Additionally, a dose-response relationship between lower serum IgA and number of exacerbations was found among individuals with serum IgA in the lowest decile, further supporting the link between serum IgA and exacerbation risk. Future COPD studies should more comprehensively characterize immune status to define the clinical relevance of these findings and their potential for therapeutic correction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194924</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6d80d12d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nirupama Putcha, Gabriel G.

Data on carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children &amp;lt;5years and adults &gt;65 years (2004–2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases). Serotypes 6C, 23B and 11A have high carriage prevalence in children, but show low invasive disease potential. Serotype 8 is the main causative agent for IPD in older adults (11.3%). In conclusion, 10 years after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children in The Netherlands shifts in carriage and disease serotypes are still ongoing. Surveillance of both carriage and IPD is important to assess PCV impact and to predict necessary future vaccination strategies in both children and older adults.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194823</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>590fb747</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marloes Vissers, Alienke J.

To grow straight and upright, plants need to regulate actively their posture. Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation (tilting) experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observations of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. The relationship between those oscillations and the postural control of the organ remains unclear, but indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7ec64172</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Renaud Bastien, Olivia Guayasamin, Stéphane Douady, Bruno Moulia&lt;/p&gt;

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sensitive inflammatory marker rapidly increased in response to infection, injury or trauma during the acute phase. Resolution of the acute phase and SAA reduction are well documented, however the exact mechanism remains elusive. Two inducible SAA proteins, SAA1 and SAA2, with their variants could contribute to systemic inflammation. While unconjugated human variant SAA1α is already commercially available, the variants of SAA2 are not. Antibodies against SAA have been identified in apparently healthy blood donors (HBDs) in smaller, preliminary studies. So, our objective was to detect anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in the sera of 300 HBDs using ELISA, characterize their specificity and avidity. Additionally, we aimed to determine the presence of anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations and examine their effects on released IL-6 from SAA/SAA1α-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Autoantibodies against SAA and SAA1α had a median (IQR) absorbance OD (A&lt;sub&gt;450&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.655 (0.262–1.293) and 0.493 (0.284–0.713), respectively. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α exhibited heterogeneous to high avidity and reached peak levels between 41–50 years, then diminished with age in the oldest group (51–67 years). Women consistently exhibited significantly higher levels than men. Good positive correlation was observed between anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α were detected in IVIg, their fractions subsequently isolated, and shown to decrease IL-6 protein levels released from SAA/SAA1α-treated PBMCs. In conclusion, naturally occurring antibodies against SAA and anti-SAA1α could play a physiological role in down-regulating their antigen and proinflammatory cytokines leading to the resolution of the acute phase and could be an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195346</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bbb665c1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tadeja Kuret, Katja Lakota, Polonca Mali, Saša Čučnik, Sonja Praprotnik, Matija Tomšič, Snezna Sodin-Semrl&lt;/p&gt;

Increasing evidence indicates that the Golgi apparatus plays active roles in cancer, but a comprehensive understanding of its functions in the oncogenic transformation has not yet emerged. At the same time, the Golgi is becoming well recognized as a hub that integrates its functions of protein and lipid biosynthesis to signal transduction for cell proliferation and migration in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the active function of the Golgi apparatus in cancer cells has not been fully evaluated as a target for combined treatment. Here, we analyzed the effect of perturbing the Golgi apparatus on the sensitivity of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to the drugs Actinomycin D and Vinblastine. We disrupted the function of ARF1, a protein necessary for the homeostasis of the Golgi apparatus. We found that the expression of the ARF1-Q71L mutant increased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to both Actinomycin D and Vinblastine, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and cell migration, as well as in increased apoptosis. Likewise, the combined treatment of cells with Actinomycin D or Vinblastine and Brefeldin A or Golgicide A, two disrupting agents of the ARF1 function, resulted in similar effects on cell proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis. Interestingly, each combined treatment had distinct effects on ERK1/2 and AKT signaling, as indicated by the decreased levels of either phospho-ERK1/2 or phospho-AKT. Our results suggest that disruption of Golgi function could be used as a strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195401</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4838f225</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charlotte Luchsinger, Marcelo Aguilar, Patricia V.

Distance between rows and plants are essential parameters that affect the final grain yield in row crops. This paper presents the results of research intended to develop a novel method to quantify the distance between maize plants at field scale using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Using this method, we can recognize maize plants as objects and calculate the distance between plants. We initially developed our method by training an algorithm in an indoor facility with plastic corn plants. Then, the method was scaled up and tested in a farmer’s field with maize plant spacing that exhibited natural variation. The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to precisely quantify the distance between maize plants. We found that accuracy of the measurement of the distance between maize plants depended on the height above ground level at which UAV imagery was taken. This study provides an innovative approach to quantify plant-to-plant variability and, thereby final crop yield estimates.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195223</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f0fe591b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinshui Zhang, Bruno Basso, Richard F.

Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power–integrated information (Φ), and showing that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to “beat” the micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for Φ across different spatial and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible &lt;i&gt;black boxes&lt;/i&gt;. These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of Φ across several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nmwWC-o9ix4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by William Marshall, Larissa Albantakis, Giulio Tononi&lt;/p&gt;

Trace metal dynamics have not been studied with respect to growth increments in octocorals.

We benchmark our results and highlight the applicability of the package by an interesting problem in RNA design, namely the interaction of tetracycline with an aptamer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.39</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders: CRISPR to the rescue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders: CRISPR to the rescue, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.39&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders: CRISPR to the rescue&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/dLnzfkDigJc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders: CRISPR to the rescue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders: CRISPR to the rescue, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.39&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders: CRISPR to the rescue&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/dLnzfkDigJc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>305</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nrd.2018.39-i1.jpg</url><width>300</width></visual><crawled>1522217097879</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2a887f42</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.39</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/dLnzfkDigJc/nrd.2018.39</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>M.

We present a fast, robust and parsimonious approach to detecting signals in an ordered sequence of numbers. Our motivation is in seeking a suitable method to take a sequence of scores corresponding to properties of positions in virus genomes, and find outlying regions of low scores. Suitable statistical methods without using complex models or making many assumptions are surprisingly lacking. We resolve this by developing a method that detects regions of low score within sequences of real numbers. The method makes no assumptions &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; about the length of such a region; it gives the explicit location of the region and scores it statistically. It does not use detailed mechanistic models so the method is fast and will be useful in a wide range of applications. We present our approach in detail, and test it on simulated sequences. We show that it is robust to a wide range of signal morphologies, and that it is able to capture multiple signals in the same sequence. Finally we apply it to viral genomic data to identify regions of evolutionary conservation within influenza and rotavirus.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195763</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8e3101ff</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julia R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease, which is defined as having a reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and/or signs of kidney damage (albuminuria), is highly prevalent in Western society and is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. This warrants a search for risk factors of lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. Physical activity and sedentary behavior may be such risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine associations of physical activity (total, high, low), sedentary time and sedentary behavior patterns (breaks, prolonged bouts, average bout duration) with eGFR and albuminuria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We examined these associations in 2,258 participants of the Maastricht Study (average age 60.1±8.1 years; 51.3% men), who wore an accelerometer 24h/day on 7 consecutive days. Associations with continuous eGFR and categories of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; &amp;lt;15 [reference category], 15-&amp;lt;30, ≥30 mg/24h) were evaluated with linear regression analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After adjustment for potential confounders, each extra hour of total physical activity was associated with a more favorable kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.30 (95%CI = 1.46; 3.14)), whereas each extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with a more adverse kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.71 (-1.08; -0.35)). Also, compared to individuals with the lowest levels of total physical activity, individuals with the highest levels had less kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.63 (0.41; 0.96), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.84 (0.53; 1.35). An extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with more kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.11 (1.01; 1.22), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.10 (0.99; 1.22)). Further, a highly sedentary pattern was associated with a more adverse kidney function, but no association was seen with kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Physical activity and sedentary behavior were associated with kidney function and kidney damage. Additionally, sedentary behavior patterns were associated with kidney function. Causal studies are required to examine whether this indeed implicates that prevention strategies should focus not only on increasing physical activity, but on reducing sedentary behavior as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195306</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>76a5e3f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Remy J.

&lt;i&gt;Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum&lt;/i&gt; is a thermophilic anaerobe that has been engineered to produce high amounts of ethanol, reaching ~90% theoretical yield at a titer of 70 g/L.

In particular the universal enrichment of negative charge and the larger than average SES area for a polar atom on the surface of a water-soluble protein suggest that from a protein-solvent interaction perspective to fold into a native state is to optimize the electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between solvent molecules and the surface polar atoms of a protein rather than to only minimize its apolar surface area.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294082v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Wang, L.</name></author><title>The solvent-excluded surfaces of water-soluble proteins [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162915cffce:9e2384b:9f3b30f2</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294082v1?rss=1</link><published>1522825200000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.1002626</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS Biology Staff &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot;

The co-existence of several ploidy types in natural populations makes the cyprinid loach &lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; an exciting model system to study the genetic and phenotypic consequences of ploidy variations. A first step in such effort is to identify the specific ploidy of an individual. Currently popular methods of karyotyping via cytological preparation or flow cytometry require a large amount of tissue (such as blood) samples, which can be damaging or fatal to the fishes. Here, we developed novel microsatellite markers (SSR markers) from &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; and show that they can effectively discriminate ploidy using samples collected in a minimally invasive way. Specifically, we generated whole genome transcriptomes from multiple &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; using the Illumina paired-end sequencing. Approximately 150 million raw reads were assembled into 76,544 non-redundant unigenes. A total of 8,194 potential SSR markers were identified. We selected 98 pairs with more than five tandem repeats for further assays. Out of 45 putative EST-SSR markers that successfully amplified and harbored polymorphism in diploids, 11 markers displayed high variability in tetraploids. We further demonstrate that a set of five EST-SSR markers selected from these are sufficient to distinguish ploidy levels, by first validating them on 69 reference specimens with known ploidy levels and then subsequently using fresh-collected 96 ploidy-unknown specimens. The results from EST-SSR markers are highly concordant with those from independent flow cytometry analysis. The novel EST-SSR markers developed here should facilitate genetic studies of polyploidy in the emerging model system &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195829</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>98eba322</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bing Feng, Soojin V.

The human gut microbiome contributes to a broad range of biochemical and metabolic functions that directly or indirectly affect human physiology. Several recent studies have indicated that factors like age, geographical location, genetic makeup, and individual health status significantly influence the diversity, stability, and resilience of the gut microbiome. Of the mentioned factors, geographical location (and related dietary/socio-economic context) appears to explain a significant portion of microbiome variation observed in various previously conducted base-line studies on human gut microbiome. Given this context, we have undertaken a microbiome study with the objective of cataloguing the taxonomic diversity of gut microbiomes sampled from an urban cohort from Ahmedabad city in Western India. Computational analysis of microbiome sequence data corresponding to 160 stool samples (collected from 80 healthy individuals at two time-points, 60 days apart) has indicated a &lt;i&gt;Prevotella&lt;/i&gt;-dominated microbial community. Given that the typical diet of participants included carbohydrate and fibre-rich components (predominantly whole grains and legume-based preparations), results appear to validate the proposed correlation between diet/geography and microbiome composition. Comparative analysis of obtained gut microbiome profiles with previously published microbiome profiles from US, China, Finland, and Japan additionally reveals a distinct taxonomic and (inferred) functional niche for the sampled microbiomes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195643</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5aaf8c7b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Disha Tandon, Mohammed Monzoorul Haque, Saravanan R., Shafiq Shaikh, Sriram P., Ashok Kumar Dubey, Sharmila S.

This is a fundamental processing step in computational neuroimaging. The notion of leave-one-out consistent (LOOC) landmarks with respect to a supervised landmark detection algorithm is introduced. An automatic algorithm is presented for identification of LOOC landmarks on MRI scans. Using this technique, multiple sets of LOOC landmarks (around 150) are identified on each of the volumes being registered. Then, a Generalized Orthogonal Procrustes Analysis of the identified landmarks is used to find a rigid-body transformation of each volume into a common space where the transformed volumes are precisely aligned. In addition, a new approach is introduced for quantitative assessment of registration accuracy in the absence of a gold standard. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of ATRA registration accuracy are performed using 2012 volumes from 503 subjects (4 longitudinal volumes/subject) from the Alzheimer&apos;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, and on a further 120 volumes acquired from 3 normal subjects (40 longitudinal volumes/subject).

This is a fundamental processing step in computational neuroimaging. The notion of leave-one-out consistent (LOOC) landmarks with respect to a supervised landmark detection algorithm is introduced. An automatic algorithm is presented for identification of LOOC landmarks on MRI scans. Using this technique, multiple sets of LOOC landmarks (around 150) are identified on each of the volumes being registered. Then, a Generalized Orthogonal Procrustes Analysis of the identified landmarks is used to find a rigid-body transformation of each volume into a common space where the transformed volumes are precisely aligned. In addition, a new approach is introduced for quantitative assessment of registration accuracy in the absence of a gold standard. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of ATRA registration accuracy are performed using 2012 volumes from 503 subjects (4 longitudinal volumes/subject) from the Alzheimer&apos;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, and on a further 120 volumes acquired from 3 normal subjects (40 longitudinal volumes/subject). The algorithm is symmetric, in the sense that any permutation of the input volumes does not change the resulting transformation matrices, and unbiased, in the sense that all volumes undergo one and only one interpolation operation, which precisely aligns them in a common space. There is no interpolation bias and no reference volume. All volumes are treated exactly the same. The algorithm is fast and highly accurate. The software is publicly available.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/306811v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ardekani, B.

Muscle atrophy (loss of skeletal muscle mass) causes progressive deterioration of skeletal function. Recently, excessive intake of fats was suggested to induce insulin resistance, followed by muscle atrophy. Green tea extracts (GTEs), which contain polyphenols such as epigallocatechin gallate, have beneficial effects on obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, but their effects against muscle atrophy are still unclear. Here, we found that GTEs prevented high-fat (HF) diet–induced muscle weight loss in senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8), a murine model of senescence. SAMP8 mice were fed a control diet, an HF diet, or HF with 0.5% GTEs (HFGT) diet for 4 months. The HF diet induced muscle weight loss with aging (measured as quadriceps muscle weight), whereas GTEs prevented this loss. In HF diet–fed mice, blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations increased in comparison with the control group, and these mice had insulin resistance as determined by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In these mice, serum concentrations of leukocyte cell–derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), which is known to induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, were elevated, and insulin signaling in muscle, as determined by the phosphorylation levels of Akt and p70 S6 kinases, tended to be decreased. In HFGT diet–fed mice, these signs of insulin resistance and elevation of serum LECT2 were not observed. Although our study did not directly show the effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, insulin resistance examined using HOMA-IR indicated an intervention effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, as revealed by partial correlation analysis. Accordingly, GTEs might have beneficial effects on age-related and HF diet–induced muscle weight loss, which correlates with insulin resistance and is accompanied by a change in serum LECT2.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195753</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>73992784</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shintaro Onishi, Mayu Ishino, Hidefumi Kitazawa, Ai Yoto, Yuki Shimba, Yusuke Mochizuki, Keiko Unno, Shinichi Meguro, Ichiro Tokimitsu, Shinji Miura&lt;/p&gt;

Pathogen genome sequencing can reveal details of transmission histories and is a powerful tool in the fight against infectious disease. In particular, within-host pathogen genomic variants identified through heterozygous nucleotide base calls are a potential source of information to identify linked cases and infer direction and time of transmission. However, using such data effectively to model disease transmission presents a number of challenges, including differentiating genuine variants from those observed due to sequencing error, as well as the specification of a realistic model for within-host pathogen population dynamics. Here we propose a new Bayesian approach to transmission inference, BadTrIP (BAyesian epiDemiological TRansmission Inference from Polymorphisms), that explicitly models evolution of pathogen populations in an outbreak, transmission (including transmission bottlenecks), and sequencing error. BadTrIP enables the inference of host-to-host transmission from pathogen sequencing data and epidemiological data. By assuming that genomic variants are unlinked, our method does not require the computationally intensive and unreliable reconstruction of individual haplotypes. Using simulations we show that BadTrIP is robust in most scenarios and can accurately infer transmission events by efficiently combining information from genetic and epidemiological sources; thanks to its realistic model of pathogen evolution and the inclusion of epidemiological data, BadTrIP is also more accurate than existing approaches. BadTrIP is distributed as an open source package (https://bitbucket.org/nicofmay/badtrip) for the phylogenetic software BEAST2. We apply our method to reconstruct transmission history at the early stages of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, showcasing the power of within-host genomic variants to reconstruct transmission events.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rbi3PORvpr0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicola De Maio, Colin J.

This study investigated the role of individual differences (dark personality) and situational factors (perceived organisational support) in explaining intention to quit. Four hundred and fifty-one (50 of which females) ambulance personnel completed three questionnaires (Hogan Development Survey; Perceived Organisational Support Survey; and a single item Intention to Quit measure) as a part of a selection and development assessment. Employees high on Excitable, Sceptical, and Mischievous, but low on Colourful were found to have greater intentions to quit. Additionally, employees high on Excitable, Sceptical, Reserved, and Leisurely, but low on Dutiful and Diligent had lower perceptions of organisational support.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We wanted to re-evaluate the influence of confined placental mosaicism subtypes (type 2 and type 3) on pregnancy characteristics and outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;From July 2009 to December 2015, 5512 chorionic villus samplings were performed in our Fetal Medicine Center. Conventional karyotyping was performed after long-term and short-term cultured villi to define type 2 or type 3 confined placental mosaicisms. Karyotype after amniocentesis was performed to exclude true fetal mosaicism, when appropriate. Pregnancy characteristics and outcomes were collected and compared to a control population.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-six (0.65%) confined placental mosaicisms were observed (13 type 2 and 23 type 3).

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We wanted to re-evaluate the influence of confined placental mosaicism subtypes (type 2 and type 3) on pregnancy characteristics and outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;From July 2009 to December 2015, 5512 chorionic villus samplings were performed in our Fetal Medicine Center. Conventional karyotyping was performed after long-term and short-term cultured villi to define type 2 or type 3 confined placental mosaicisms. Karyotype after amniocentesis was performed to exclude true fetal mosaicism, when appropriate. Pregnancy characteristics and outcomes were collected and compared to a control population.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-six (0.65%) confined placental mosaicisms were observed (13 type 2 and 23 type 3). Nuchal translucency was not increased for type 2 and type 3 confined placental mosaicisms. Pregnancy characteristics and outcomes were comparable between type 2 confined placental mosaicisms and the control population. In type 3 confined placental mosaicisms, median first trimester serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A was lower than for the control population (p&amp;lt;0.001), preterm births were noticed in 56% (p&amp;lt;0.001), small for gestational age newborns in 74% (p&amp;lt;0.001), and adverse pregnancy outcome was reported in 35% (p&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Although type 2 confined placental mosaicisms appeared to have no influence on pregnancy characteristics and outcome, type 3 confined placental mosaicisms were associated with low levels of first trimester serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, preterm birth, small for gestational age newborns, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195905</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jérôme Toutain</name></author><title>Confined placental mosaicism revisited: Impact on pregnancy characteristics and outcome</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d9:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195905</link><published>1523566800000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04053-z</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uptick in US female members of International Astronomical Union&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uptick in US female members of International Astronomical Union, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04053-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04053-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Uptick in US female members of International Astronomical Union</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522843724656</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b7d6ec87</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uptick in US female members of International Astronomical Union&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uptick in US female members of International Astronomical Union, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04053-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04053-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Uptick in US female members of International Astronomical Union</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04053-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>David  Soderblom</name></author><title>Uptick in US female members of International Astronomical Union</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162908f2b70:9a0228d:7d6c1c1c</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04053-z</link><published>1522825200000</published></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3261.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>A potential human footprint on Western Central African rainforests before the Common Era has become the focus of an ongoing controversy.

The relative age effect (RAE; i.e., an asymmetry in the birth distribution) is a bias observed in sport competitions that may favour relatively older athletes in talent identification. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RAE in elite soccer players competing in the Italian championships, even considering the discriminations of younger and older &lt;i&gt;Serie A&lt;/i&gt; players (in relation to the median age of the sample), and different positional roles (i.e., goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, forward) for each observed category. A total of 2051 players competing into the 2017–2018 Italian under-15 (n = 265), under-16 (n = 362), under-17 (n = 403), &lt;i&gt;Primavera&lt;/i&gt; (n = 421) and &lt;i&gt;Serie A&lt;/i&gt; (n = 600) championships were analysed. The birth-date distributions, grouped in four quartiles (i.e., January-March, Q1; April-June, Q2; July-September, Q3; October-December, Q4), were compared to a uniform distribution using Chi-squared analysis. The week of birth was analysed using Poisson regression. The results showed a large over-representation of players born in Q1 in all soccer player categories. However, the effect size of this trend resulted smaller as age increased. Individuals born in Q1 have about two-folds more chances to become a &lt;i&gt;Serie A&lt;/i&gt; player compared to those born in Q4. The Poisson regression analysis showed that RAE was greater for defenders than for forwards among all categories. Therefore, a strongly biased selection emerged among elite soccer players competing in Italian championships, highlighting how young individuals born in the first three months have many more chances to become elite players compared to the others.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196253</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f3edcc47</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paolo Riccardo Brustio, Corrado Lupo, Alexandru Nicolae Ungureanu, Riccardo Frati, Alberto Rainoldi, Gennaro Boccia&lt;/p&gt;

The large body of work demonstrating hyperthermic impairment of neuromuscular function has utilized maximal isometric contractions, but extrapolating these findings to whole-body exercise and submaximal, dynamic contractions may be problematic. We isolated and compared core and skin temperature influences on an isometric force task versus a position task requiring dynamic maintenance of joint angle. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured on the flexor carpi radialis at 60% of baseline maximal voluntary contraction while either pushing against a rigid restraint (force task) or while maintaining a constant wrist angle and supporting an equivalent inertial load (position task). Twenty participants performed each task at 0.5°C rectal temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;) intervals while being passively heated from 37.1±0.3°C to ≥1.5°C T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; and then cooled to 37.8±0.3°C, permitting separate analyses of core versus skin temperature influences. During a 3-s contraction, trend analysis revealed a quadratic trend that peaked during hyperthermia for root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude during the force task. In contrast, RMS amplitude during the position task remained stable with passive heating, then rapidly increased with the initial decrease in skin temperature at the onset of passive cooling (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010). Combined hot core and hot skin elicited shifts toward higher frequencies in the sEMG signal during the force task (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), whereas inconsistent changes in the frequency spectra occurred for the position task. Based on the patterns of RMS amplitude in response to thermal stress, we conclude that core temperature was the primary thermal afferent influencing neuromuscular response during a submaximal force task, with minimal input from skin temperature. However, skin temperature was the primary thermal afferent during a position task with minimal core temperature influence. Therefore, temperature has a task-dependent impact on neuromuscular responses.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195219</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8544f1bc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nico A.

Despite an increase in dengue outbreaks and the arrival of chikungunya and Zika disease in Panama, studies on the demographic history of the invasive &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes that are the principle vectors of these diseases are still lacking in this region. Here, we assess the genetic diversity of these mosquitoes in order to decipher their invasion histories into the Isthmus of Panama. DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase I gene obtained from 30 localities in 10 provinces confirmed the presence of more than one mitochondrial haplogroup (i.e., maternal lineage) in each species. The invasion of &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was likely from temperate European countries, as the most frequent and widespread haplogroup in Panama harbored variants that are uncommon elsewhere in the Americas. Two infrequent and geographically restricted &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; haplotypes appear to have subsequently invaded Panama from neighboring Costa Rica and the USA, respectively. In addition, we recovered two deeply divergent mitochondrial clades in Panamanian &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. The geographic origins of these clades is unknown, given that divergence in the mitochondrial genome is probably due to ancient population processes within the native range of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt;, rather than due to its global expansion out of Africa. However, Panamanian &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mitochondrial sequences within the first clade were closely related to others from Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico and the USA, suggesting two separate invasions from Western Hemisphere source populations. The pattern of increased genetic diversity in &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes in Panama is likely facilitated by the numerous land and water inter-connections across the country, which allows them to enter via sea- and land-transportation from Europe, North, Central and South America. Our results here should be considered in disease mitigation programs if emergent arboviruses are to be effectively diminished in Panama through vector suppression.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194874</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ee1f55c6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gilberto A.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins. We therefore investigated whether SWAN can help predict ischemic penumbra-like lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) records—including SWAN, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)—of consecutive patients with major vessel occlusion within 6 h from AIS onset were analyzed. Acute recanalization was defined as an arterial occlusive lesion score of 2–3. A modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (mASPECTS) was used to evaluate ischemic areas revealed by SWAN and DWI. SWAN- and DWI-based mASPECTSs were calculated, and correlations between DWI-SWAN mismatches with final infarct lesions or clinical outcomes were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 35 patients included in this study, we confirmed cardioembolic stroke in 26, atherothrombotic stroke in 4, and unknown stroke etiology in 5. Overall, recanalization was achieved in 23 patients, who showed a higher follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and lower modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days than patients without recanalization. Initial SWAN- and follow-up DWI-based mASPECTSs were significantly higher for atherothrombotic stroke than for cardioembolic stroke. Of 12 patients without recanalization, DWI-SWAN mismatch was significantly correlated with infarct growth. Patients with recanalization showed no such correlation. In the assessment of clinical outcome, follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and patient&apos;s age were significantly correlated with mRS at 90 days after stroke. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS was independently associated with a favorable outcome 90 days after stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For patients with AIS, DWI-SWAN mismatch might show penumbra-like lesions that would predict infarct growth without acute recanalization. Assessment of ischemic lesions from the venous side appears to be useful for considering the etiology and revascularization therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195554</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>842f3c7b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susumu Yamaguchi, Nobutaka Horie, Minoru Morikawa, Yohei Tateishi, Takeshi Hiu, Yoichi Morofuji, Tsuyoshi Izumo, Kentaro Hayashi, Takayuki Matsuo&lt;/p&gt;

Our RNA sequencing analysis of NAFLD-HCC samples revealed squalene epoxidase (&lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt;) as the top outlier metabolic gene overexpressed in NAFLD-HCC patients. Hepatocyte-specific &lt;i&gt;Sqle&lt;/i&gt; transgenic expression in mice accelerated the development of high-fat, high-cholesterol diet–induced HCC. &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt; exerts its oncogenic effect via its metabolites, cholesteryl ester and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Increased &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt; expression promotes the biosynthesis of cholesteryl ester, which induces NAFLD-HCC cell growth. &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt; increased the NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/NADPH (reduced form of NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ratio, which triggered a cascade of events involving oxidative stress–induced DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) expression, DNMT3A-mediated epigenetic silencing of PTEN, and activation of AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). In human NAFLD-HCC and HCC, &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt; is overexpressed and its expression is associated with poor patient outcomes. Terbinafine, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved antifungal drug targeting &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt;, markedly inhibited &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt;-induced NAFLD-HCC cell growth in NAFLD-HCC and HCC cells and attenuated tumor development in xenograft models and in &lt;i&gt;Sqle&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice. Suppression of tumor growth by terbinafine is associated with decreased cholesteryl ester concentrations, restoration of PTEN expression, and inhibition of AKT-mTOR, consistent with blockade of SQLE function.

This study explores the association between specific insomnia symptoms (sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early morning awakenings symptoms) and self-efficacy (perceived self-confidence in the ability to use CPAP) with CPAP compliance in French patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of CPAP compliance in a cohort of 404 patients diagnosed with OSAS. Patients completed mailed questionnaires on sleepiness (ESS), insomnia (ISI) and self-efficacy in sleep apnea (SEMSA). Linear regression modeling analyses were performed to explore the impact of measured variables on the number of hours of CPAP use. Of the initial pool of 404 patients, 288 returned the questionnaires (71% response rate). Their mean age was 63.16±12.73 yrs, 31% were females, mean BMI was 30.39±6.31 kg/m2, mean daily CPAP use was 6.19±2.03 h, mean number of years of use was 6.58±6.03 yrs, and mean initial AHI before CPAP use was 34.61±20.71 /h. Age (p&amp;lt;0.01), BMI (p&amp;lt;0.01), sleep onset insomnia symptoms (p&amp;lt;0.01), sleep maintenance insomnia symptoms (p&amp;lt;0.01) and self-efficacy (p&amp;lt;0.01) were significantly associated with mean daily CPAP use. We found that specific insomnia symptoms and self-efficacy were associated with CPAP compliance. Our findings underline the need to demonstrate that interventions that reduce insomnia symptoms and improve self-efficacy will increase CPAP compliance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195343</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6805e459</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pierre Philip, Stéphanie Bioulac, Elemarije Altena, Charles M.

Vasculature is an interface between the circulation and the hematopoietic tissue providing the means for hundreds of billions of blood cells to enter the circulation every day in a regulated fashion. The precise mechanisms that control the interactions of hematopoietic cells with the vessel wall are largely undefined. Here, we report on the development of an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; 3D human marrow vascular microenvironment (VME) to study hematopoietic trafficking and the release of blood cells, specifically platelets. We show that mature megakaryocytes from aspirated marrow as well as megakaryocytes differentiated in culture from CD34+ cells can be embedded in a collagen matrix containing engineered microvessels to create a thrombopoietic VME. These megakaryocytes continue to mature, penetrate the vessel wall, and release platelets into the vessel lumen. This process can be blocked with the addition of antibodies specific for CXCR4, indicating that CXCR4 is required for megakaryocyte migration, though whether it is sufficient is unclear. The 3D marrow VME system shows considerable potential for mechanistic studies defining the role of marrow vasculature in thrombopoiesis. Through a stepwise addition or removal of individual marrow components, this model provides potential to define key pathways responsible for the release of platelets and other blood cells.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195082</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>aabb7852</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Surya Kotha, Sijie Sun, Amie Adams, Brian Hayes, Kiet T.

Despite the widespread acceptance of rotary blood pump (RBP) in clinical use over the past decades, the diminished flow pulsatility generated by a fixed speed RBP has been regarded as a potential factor that may lead to adverse events such as vasculature stiffening and hemorrhagic strokes. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of generating physiological pulse pressure in the pulmonary circulation by modulating the speed of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) in a mock circulation loop. A rectangular pulse profile with predetermined pulse width has been implemented as the pump speed pattern with two different phase shifts (0% and 50%) with respect to the ventricular contraction. In addition, the performance of the speed modulation strategy has been assessed under different cardiovascular states, including variation in ventricular contractility and pulmonary arterial compliance. Our results indicated that the proposed pulse profile with optimised parameters (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt; = 10000 rpm and &lt;i&gt;ω&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = 3000 rpm) was able to generate pulmonary arterial pulse pressure within the physiological range (9–15 mmHg) while avoiding undesirable pump backflow under both co- and counter-pulsation modes. As compared to co-pulsation, stroke work was reduced by over 44% under counter-pulsation, suggesting that mechanical workload of the right ventricle can be efficiently mitigated through counter-pulsing the pump speed. Furthermore, our results showed that improved ventricular contractility could potentially lead to higher risk of ventricular suction and pump backflow, while stiffening of the pulmonary artery resulted in increased pulse pressure. In conclusion, the proposed speed modulation strategy produces pulsatile hemodynamics, which is more physiologic than continuous blood flow. The findings also provide valuable insight into the interaction between RVAD speed modulation and the pulmonary circulation under various cardiovascular states.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195975</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d1e8c9a0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Boon C.

We previously introduced an approach for EVD prognosis prediction, using models that can be implemented in the field and updated in light of new data. Here we enhance and validate our methods with the largest published EVD dataset to date. We also present a proof-of-concept medical app that summarizes patient information and offers tailored treatment options using an interactive visualization for quick interpretation and decision-making. Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district.

We previously introduced an approach for EVD prognosis prediction, using models that can be implemented in the field and updated in light of new data. Here we enhance and validate our methods with the largest published EVD dataset to date. We also present a proof-of-concept medical app that summarizes patient information and offers tailored treatment options using an interactive visualization for quick interpretation and decision-making. Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district. We corroborated earlier reports on the importance of viral load and age as mortality predictors and identified jaundice and bleeding to be features with highest predictive value at presentation. Additional clinical symptoms at presentation, although individually weakly correlated with outcome, help broaden sensitivity and refine discrimination of the models. The app provides a visual representation of the predictive outcome as well as attributing clinical protocols adjusted by demographic parameters and prioritized to target the largest contributing factor to overall risk. Conclusions: We derived and validated high performance models of EVD prognosis prediction from the largest and most geographically diverse EVD patients available to date. The performance was maintained during external validations on two independent datasets representing different treatment settings and mortality rates, which suggests that the models could be generalized to new populations. This tool may better inform treatment choices in future EVD outbreaks.

Thirteen variants (13/128, 10%) were ultimately classified as pathogenic. Most deaths (63%) occurred during sleep. Gene variant carriage was more likely with a positive medical history (mostly seizures, 63% vs 36%, p = 0.01), amongst females (36% vs 12%, p = 0.001) and whites more than Maori (31% vs 0, p = 0.0009). Children 1–12 years were more likely to be gene-positive (33% vs 14%, p = 0.02). Family screening identified 42 gene-positive relatives, 18 with definitive phenotypic expression of LQTS/Brugada. 76% of the variants were maternally inherited (p = 0.007).

They have been applied in various biological contexts, including gene regulatory networks and protein-protein interactions inference. Generally, learning Bayesian networks from experimental data is NP-hard, leading to widespread use of heuristic search methods giving suboptimal results. However, in cases when the acyclicity of the graph can be externally ensured, it is possible to find the optimal network in polynomial time. While our previously developed tool BNFinder implements polynomial time algorithm, reconstructing networks with the large amount of experimental data still leads to computations on single CPU growing exceedingly. Results: In the present paper we propose parallelized algorithm designed for multi-core and distributed systems and its implementation in the improved version of BNFinder - tool for learning optimal Bayesian networks. The new algorithm has been tested on different simulated and experimental datasets showing that it has much better efficiency of parallelization than the previous version.

They have been applied in various biological contexts, including gene regulatory networks and protein-protein interactions inference. Generally, learning Bayesian networks from experimental data is NP-hard, leading to widespread use of heuristic search methods giving suboptimal results. However, in cases when the acyclicity of the graph can be externally ensured, it is possible to find the optimal network in polynomial time. While our previously developed tool BNFinder implements polynomial time algorithm, reconstructing networks with the large amount of experimental data still leads to computations on single CPU growing exceedingly. Results: In the present paper we propose parallelized algorithm designed for multi-core and distributed systems and its implementation in the improved version of BNFinder - tool for learning optimal Bayesian networks. The new algorithm has been tested on different simulated and experimental datasets showing that it has much better efficiency of parallelization than the previous version. BNFinder gives comparable results in terms of accuracy with respect to current state-of-the-art inference methods, giving significant advantage in cases when external information such as regulators list or prior edge probability can be introduced. Conclusions: We show that the new method can be used to reconstruct networks in the size range of thousands of genes making it practically applicable to whole genome datasets of prokaryotic systems and large components of eukaryotic genomes. Our benchmarking results on realistic datasets indicate that the tool should be useful to wide audience of researchers interested in discovering dependencies in their large-scale transcriptomic datasets.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/016683v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Frolova, A.</name></author><title>Distributed Bayesian Networks Reconstruction on the Whole Genome Scale [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16286ad4f58:8b3d7a1:7d6c1c1c</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/016683v2?rss=1</link><published>1522652400000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002417</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jesse Lyons, Phaedra C.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition driven by loss of homeostasis between the mucosal immune system, the commensal gut microbiota, and the intestinal epithelium. Our goal is to understand how these components of the intestinal ecosystem cooperate to control homeostasis. By combining quantitative measures of epithelial hyperplasia and immune infiltration with multivariate analysis of inter- and intracellular signaling, we identified epithelial mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling as a potential driver of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis. A kinetic analysis of mTOR inhibition revealed that the pathway regulates epithelial differentiation, which in turn controls the cytokine milieu of the colon. Consistent with our in vivo analysis, we found that cytokine expression of organoids grown ex vivo, in the absence of bacteria and immune cells, was dependent on differentiation state. Our study suggests that proper differentiation of epithelial cells is an important feature of colonic homeostasis because of its effect on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZpVf1yiGbfQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jesse Lyons, Phaedra C.

Assessment of researchers is necessary for decisions of hiring, promotion, and tenure. A burgeoning number of scientific leaders believe the current system of faculty incentives and rewards is misaligned with the needs of society and disconnected from the evidence about the causes of the reproducibility crisis and suboptimal quality of the scientific publication record. To address this issue, particularly for the clinical and life sciences, we convened a 22-member expert panel workshop in Washington, DC, in January 2017. Twenty-two academic leaders, funders, and scientists participated in the meeting. As background for the meeting, we completed a selective literature review of 22 key documents critiquing the current incentive system. From each document, we extracted how the authors perceived the problems of assessing science and scientists, the unintended consequences of maintaining the status quo for assessing scientists, and details of their proposed solutions. The resulting table was used as a seed for participant discussion. This resulted in six principles for assessing scientists and associated research and policy implications. We hope the content of this paper will serve as a basis for establishing best practices and redesigning the current approaches to assessing scientists by the many players involved in that process.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oSr6VqA7_WQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by David Moher, Florian Naudet, Ioana A.

The experimental set-up of this study mimicked recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) where water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity were controlled and wastes produced by fish and feeding were converted to inorganic forms. A key process in the RAS was the conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate through nitrification. It was hypothesized that algae inclusion in RAS would improve the ammonia removal from the water; thereby improving RAS water quality and stability. To test this hypothesis, the stability of the microbiota community composition in a freshwater RAS with (RAS+A) or without algae (RAS-A) was challenged by introducing an acute pH drop (from pH 7 to 4 during three hours) to the system. &lt;i&gt;Stigeoclonium nanum&lt;/i&gt;, a periphytic freshwater microalga was used in this study. No significant effect of the algae presence was found on the resistance to the acute pH drop on ammonia conversion to nitrite and nitrite conversion to nitrate. Also the resilience of the ammonia conversion to the pH drop disruption was not affected by the addition of algae. This could be due to the low biomass of algae achieved in the RAS. However, with regard to the conversion step of nitrite to nitrate, RAS+A was significantly more resilient than RAS-A. In terms of overall bacterial communities, the composition and predictive function of the bacterial communities was significantly different between RAS+A and RAS-A.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195862</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>85b2132a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Norulhuda Mohamed Ramli, Christos Giatsis, Fatimah Md Yusoff, Johan Verreth, Marc Verdegem&lt;/p&gt;
The experimental set-up of this study mimicked recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) where water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity were controlled and wastes produced by fish and feeding were converted to inorganic forms. A key process in the RAS was the conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate through nitrification. It was hypothesized that algae inclusion in RAS would improve the ammonia removal from the water; thereby improving RAS water quality and stability. To test this hypothesis, the stability of the microbiota community composition in a freshwater RAS with (RAS+A) or without algae (RAS-A) was challenged by introducing an acute pH drop (from pH 7 to 4 during three hours) to the system. &lt;i&gt;Stigeoclonium nanum&lt;/i&gt;, a periphytic freshwater microalga was used in this study.

L-carnitine is important for the catabolism of long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria. We investigated how the triacylglycerol (TAG)-lowering drug 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) influenced lipid metabolism in carnitine-depleted, 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium)propionate dehydrate (Mildronate; meldonium)-treated male Wistar rats. As indicated, carnitine biosynthesis was impaired by Mildronate. However, TAG levels of both plasma and liver were decreased by 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated animals. This was accompanied by increased gene expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial activity and proliferation and reduced mRNA levels of &lt;i&gt;Dgat2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ApoB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ApoCIII&lt;/i&gt; in liver. The hepatic energy state was reduced in the group of Mildronate and 1-triple TTA as reflected by increased AMP/ATP ratio, reduced energy charge and induced gene expression of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3. The increase in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation was observed despite low plasma carnitine levels, and was linked to strongly induced gene expression of carnitine acetyltransferase, translocase and carnitine transporter, suggesting an efficient carnitine turnover. The present data suggest that the plasma TAG-lowering effect of 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated rats is not only due to increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation reflected by increased mitochondrial biogenesis, but also to changes in plasma clearance and reduced TAG biosynthesis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194978</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e96e7acc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carine Lindquist, Bodil Bjørndal, Christine Renate Rossmann, Asbjørn Svardal, Seth Hallström, Rolf Kristian Berge&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Adult leg length is influenced by nutrition in the first few years of life. Adult head circumference is an indicator of brain growth. Cross-sectional studies indicate inverse associations with dementia risk, but there have been few prospective studies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Population-based cohort studies in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic Puerto Rico and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Sociodemographic and risk factor questionnaires were administered to all participants, and anthropometric measures taken, with ascertainment of incident dementia, and mortality, three to five years later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the original at risk cohort of 13,587 persons aged 65 years and over, 2,443 (18.0%) were lost to follow-up; 10,540 persons with skull circumference assessments were followed up for 40,466 person years, and 10,400 with leg length assessments were followed up for 39,954 person years. There were 1,009 cases of incident dementia, and 1,605 dementia free deaths. The fixed effect pooled meta-analysed adjusted subhazard ratio (ASHR) for leg length (highest vs. lowest quarter) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.66–0.97) and for skull circumference was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.84–1.25), with no heterogeneity of effect between sites (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). Leg length measurements tended to be shorter at follow-up, particularly for those with baseline cognitive impairment and dementia. However, leg length change was not associated with dementia incidence (ASHR, per cm 1.006, 95% CI 0.992–1.020), and the effect of leg length was little altered after adjusting for baseline frailty (ASHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–0.99). A priori hypotheses regarding effect modification by gender or educational level were not supported. However, the effect of skull circumference was modified by gender (M vs F ASHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.98), but in the opposite direction to that hypothesized with a greater protective effect of larger skull dimensions in men.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Consistent findings across settings provide quite strong support for an association between adult leg length and dementia incidence in late-life. Leg length is a relatively stable marker of early life nutritional programming, which may confer brain reserve and protect against neurodegeneration in later life through mitigation of cardiometabolic risk. Further clarification of these associations could inform predictive models for future dementia incidence in the context of secular trends in adult height, and invigorate global efforts to improve childhood nutrition, growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195133</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9d93eb2c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martin J.

The waste of commonly used medicines is known to contaminate freshwater ecosystems. Pharmaceuticals can be toxic, mutagenic, or modifying to freshwater organisms even at low concentrations if consider their permanent presence in the environment. Chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer, and in particular alkylating agents, contribute significantly to this form of pollution, the latter introducing cytotoxic and/or mutagenic lesions to the DNA and RNA of organisms which can be disruptive to their cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide (CP) on &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt; clones. We evaluated the life history parameters and protein profiles of this crustacean following exposure to environmentally relevant CP concentration of 10 ng L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Even at this low concentration, the alkylating agent caused modification of the life history parameters and proteome profile of the &lt;i&gt;Daphnia&lt;/i&gt;. These changes were clone-specific and involved growth rate, age at first reproduction, neonate number, and proteins related to cell cycle and redox state regulation. The disturbance caused by pharmaceuticals contaminating freshwater ecosystem is probably weaker and unlikely to be cytotoxic in character due to the high dilution of these substances in the water. However, our results indicate that prolonged exposure of organisms to these toxins may lead to modifications on the organismal and molecular levels with unpredictable significance for the entire ecosystem.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195366</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d431fe05</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Grzesiuk, Damian Mielecki, Tomasz Pilżys, Damian Garbicz, Michał Marcinkowski, Elżbieta Grzesiuk&lt;/p&gt;

The long-range sequencing information captured by linked reads, such as those available from 10x Genomics (10xG), helps resolve genome sequence repeats, and yields accurate and contiguous draft genome assemblies. We introduce ARKS, an alignment-free linked read genome scaffolding methodology that uses linked reads to organize genome assemblies further into contiguous drafts. Our approach departs from other read alignment-dependent linked read scaffolders, including our own (ARCS), and uses a kmer-based mapping approach. The kmer mapping strategy has several advantages over read alignment methods, including better usability and faster processing, as it precludes the need for input sequence formatting and draft sequence assembly indexing. The reliance on kmers instead of read alignments for pairing sequences relaxes the workflow requirements, and drastically reduces the run time. Results. Here, we show how linked reads, when used in conjunction with Hi-C data for scaffolding, improve a draft human genome assembly of PacBio long-read data five-fold (baseline vs. ARKS NG50=4.6 vs. 23.1 Mbp, respectively). We also demonstrate how the method provides further improvements of a megabase-scale Supernova human genome assembly, which itself exclusively uses linked read data for assembly, with an execution speed six to nine times faster than competitive linked read scaffolders. Following ARKS scaffolding of a human genome 10xG Supernova assembly (of cell line NA12878), fewer than 9 scaffolds cover each chromosome, except the largest (chromosome 1, n=13). Conclusions. ARKS uses a kmer mapping strategy instead of linked read alignments to record and associate the barcode information needed to order and orient draft assembly sequences. The simplified workflow, when compared to that of our initial implementation, ARCS, markedly improves run time performances on experimental human genome datasets.

Hyperopia is a common refractive error, apparent in 25% of Europeans. Treatments include spectacles, contact lenses, laser interventions and surgery including implantable contact lenses and lens extraction. Laser treatment offers an expedient and reliable means of correcting ametropia. LASIK is well-established however SMILE (small-incision lenticule extraction) or lenticule implantation (derived from myopic laser-correction) are newer options. In this study we compared the outcomes of hyperopic LASIK, SMILE and lenticule re-implantation in a primate model at +2D/+4D treatment. While re-implantation showed the greatest regression, broadly comparable refractive results were seen at 3-months with SMILE and LASIK (&amp;lt;1.4D of intended), but a greater tendency to regression in +2D lenticule reimplantation. Central corneal thickness showed greater variation at +2D treatment, but central thickening during lenticule reimplantation at +4D treatment was seen (-17± 27μm LASIK, -45 ± 18μm SMILE and 28 ± 17μm Re-implantation; p &amp;lt;0.01) with expected paracentral thinning following SMILE. Although in vivo confocal microscopy appeared to show higher reflectivity in all +4D treatment groups, there were minimal and inconsistent changes in inflammatory responses between modalities. SMILE and lenticule re-implantation may represent a safe and viable method for treating hyperopia, but further optimization for lower hyperopic treatments is warranted.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>11fd5c8c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Geraint P.

&lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agglomerans&lt;/i&gt;) is a Gram-negative bacterium that grows symbiotically with various edible plants, and the oral or sublingual administration of lipopolysaccharide derived from &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; (LPSp) have been suggested to contribute to prevention of immune-related diseases. Our previous study indicated that orally administered LPSp was shown to exhibit an LDL-lowering effect in hyperlipidemic volunteers; however, a preventive effect of LPSp on atherosclerosis is unclear. The present study attempted to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic effect by LPSp in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis. For 16 weeks, apoE-deficient mice were fed an HFD and received drinking water containing LPSp (0.3 or 1 mg/kg body weight/day). The results showed that the orally administered LPSp decreased body weight. A significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque deposition was observed even with the lower dose of LPSp. The biochemical analyses showed that LPSp markedly improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma LDL and oxidized LDL levels. In addition, LPSp significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators including MCP-1 (in the plasma), TNF-α and IL-6 (in the colon), and decreased the oxidative burst activities in the peripheral blood sample. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that oral administration of LPSp can effectively ameliorate HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and inflammatory/oxidative responses to prevent atherosclerosis and related metabolic disorders.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195008</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9848fbe4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yutaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Inagawa, Chie Kohchi, Kimiko Kazumura, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Miwa, Katsuichiro Okazaki, Gen-Ichiro Soma&lt;/p&gt;

The use of model-based propensity scores as matching tools opens the way to the indirect estimation of mode-related measurement effects and selection effects in web surveys, including a component of selection that cannot be traced back to observable characteristics. By matching and comparing respondents from real independent surveys that use the same questionnaire, but different administration modes, it becomes possible to isolate the selection effect induced by unobservable (or unobserved) respondent characteristics. This study applies a stratification matching algorithm to compare a web survey from a proprietary panel with a computer-assisted telephone survey based on random digit-dialing. The experiment is run in two countries (UK and Italy) to check for consistencies across different cultures and different internet penetration rates. The application to the elicitation of support for healthy eating policies indicates large and significant measurement and selection effects. After controlling for differences in the observed characteristics of respondents and the intensity of internet use, findings suggest that web surveys record lower support and higher neutrality. Similarly, after controlling for administration mode and observed respondent characteristics, internet users are less likely to state support compared to non-users. This suggests that unobserved characteristics play a major role, and post-stratification weighting is not a sufficient countermeasure. As demonstrated by the cross-country comparison, rising internet penetration rates are not a guarantee against this type of error, as disparities in these unobserved characteristics are likely to increase at the same time.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196020</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523986744698</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5d0bdfdb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Capacci, Mario Mazzocchi, Sergio Brasini&lt;/p&gt;

The poorly understood mechanisms of dry season persistence of &lt;i&gt;Anopheles&lt;/i&gt; spp. mosquitoes through the dry season in Africa remain a critical gap in our knowledge of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; disease transmission. While it is thought that adult mosquitoes remain in a dormant state throughout this seven-month dry season, the nature of this state remains unknown and has largely not been recapitulated in laboratory settings. To elucidate possible connections of this state with microbial composition, the whole body microbiomes of adult mosquitoes in the dry and wet seasons in two locations of Mali with varying water availability were compared by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. These locations were a village near the Niger River with year-round water sources (N’Gabakoro, “riparian”), and a typical Sahelian area with highly seasonal breeding sites (Thierola Area, “Sahelian”). The 16S bacterial data consisted of 2057 sequence variants in 426 genera across 184 families. From these data, we found several compositional differences that were seasonally and spatially linked. Counter to our initial hypothesis, there were more pronounced seasonal differences in the bacterial microbiome of riparian, rather than Sahelian areas. These seasonal shifts were primarily in &lt;i&gt;Ralstonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sphingorhabdus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Duganella&lt;/i&gt; spp. bacteria that are usually soil and water-associated, indicating these changes may be from bacteria acquired in the larval environment, rather than adulthood. In Sahelian dry season mosquitoes, there was a unique intracellular bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Anaplasma&lt;/i&gt;, which likely was acquired through non-human blood feeding. Cytochrome B analysis of blood meals showed greater heterogeneity in host choice of &lt;i&gt;An&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coluzzii&lt;/i&gt; independent of season in the Thierola area compared to N’Gabakoro (77.5% vs. 94.6% human-origin blood meal, respectively), indicating a relaxation of anthropophily.

The poorly understood mechanisms of dry season persistence of &lt;i&gt;Anopheles&lt;/i&gt; spp. mosquitoes through the dry season in Africa remain a critical gap in our knowledge of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; disease transmission. While it is thought that adult mosquitoes remain in a dormant state throughout this seven-month dry season, the nature of this state remains unknown and has largely not been recapitulated in laboratory settings. To elucidate possible connections of this state with microbial composition, the whole body microbiomes of adult mosquitoes in the dry and wet seasons in two locations of Mali with varying water availability were compared by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. These locations were a village near the Niger River with year-round water sources (N’Gabakoro, “riparian”), and a typical Sahelian area with highly seasonal breeding sites (Thierola Area, “Sahelian”). The 16S bacterial data consisted of 2057 sequence variants in 426 genera across 184 families. From these data, we found several compositional differences that were seasonally and spatially linked. Counter to our initial hypothesis, there were more pronounced seasonal differences in the bacterial microbiome of riparian, rather than Sahelian areas. These seasonal shifts were primarily in &lt;i&gt;Ralstonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sphingorhabdus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Duganella&lt;/i&gt; spp. bacteria that are usually soil and water-associated, indicating these changes may be from bacteria acquired in the larval environment, rather than adulthood.

Plastic pollution has been well documented in natural environments, including the open waters and sediments within lakes and rivers, the open ocean and even the air, but less attention has been paid to synthetic polymers in human consumables. Since multiple toxicity studies indicate risks to human health when plastic particles are ingested, more needs to be known about the presence and abundance of anthropogenic particles in human foods and beverages. This study investigates the presence of anthropogenic particles in 159 samples of globally sourced tap water, 12 brands of Laurentian Great Lakes beer, and 12 brands of commercial sea salt. Of the tap water samples analyzed, 81% were found to contain anthropogenic particles. The majority of these particles were fibers (98.3%) between 0.1–5 mm in length. The range was 0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L. Anthropogenic debris was found in each brand of beer and salt. Of the extracted particles, over 99% were fibers. After adjusting for particles found in lab blanks for both salt and beer, the average number of particles found in beer was 4.05 particles/L with a range of 0 to 14.3 particles/L and the average number of particles found in each brand of salt was 212 particles/kg with a range of 46.7 to 806 particles/kg.

investigated. The simplest ClO radical species as well as the two isomeric
structures XClO/ClOX for each X=H, Cl and O were studied using the PW91, TPSS,
B3LYP, PBE0, M06, M06-2X, BMK and B2PLYP functionals. Geometry optimizations as
well as reaction enthalpies and enthalpies of formation for each species were
calculated using Pople basis sets and the (aug)-cc-pVnZ Dunning sets, with
n=2-6. For the calculation of enthalpies of formation, atomization as well as
isodesmic reactions were employed. Both the precision of the methods with
respect to the increase of the basis sets, as well as their accuracy, were
gauged by comparing the results with the more accurate CCSD(T) calculations,
performed using the same basis sets as for the DFT methods. The results
obtained employing composite chemical methods (G4, CBS-QB3 and W1BD) were also
used for the comparisons, as well as the experimental results when they are
available. The results obtained show that error compensation is the key for
successful description of molecular properties (geometries and energies) by
carefully selecting method and basis sets. In general, expansion of the
one-electron basis set to the limit of completeness does not improve results at
the DFT level, but just the opposite. The enthalpies of formation calculated at
the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV6Z for the species
considered are generally in agreement with experimental determinations, and the
most accurate derived theoretically up to present. Different sources of error
in the calculations are discussed in detail.</description><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Basis_Set_Effects_in_the_Description_of_the_Cl-O_Bond_in_ClO_and_XClO_Isomers_X_H_O_Cl_Using_DFT_and_CCSD_T_Methods/6135389</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><title>Basis Set Effects in the Description of the Cl-O Bond in ClO and XClO Isomers (X=H,O,Cl) Using DFT and CCSD(T) Methods</title><unread>True</unread><published>1523577600000</published><engagement>1</engagement><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_162bf76d31c:166ff31:7d6c1c1c</id><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Basis_Set_Effects_in_the_Description_of_the_Cl-O_Bond_in_ClO_and_XClO_Isomers_X_H_O_Cl_Using_DFT_and_CCSD_T_Methods/6135389</link><summary><content>The

&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; is an important cause of infection and commonly colonizes the nasopharynx of young children, along with other potentially pathogenic bacteria. The objectives of this study were to estimate the carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Moraxella catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; in young children in Indonesia, and to examine interactions between these bacterial species. 302 healthy children aged 12–24 months were enrolled in community health centers in the Bandung, Central Lombok, and Padang regions. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and stored according to World Health Organization recommendations, and bacterial species detected by qPCR. Pneumococcal serotyping was conducted by microarray and latex agglutination/Quellung. Overall carriage prevalence was 49.5% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, 27.5% for &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, 42.7% for &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and 7.3% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;.

The centrosome is a non–membrane-bound cellular compartment consisting of 2 centrioles surrounded by a protein coat termed the pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrioles generally remain physically associated together (a phenomenon called centrosome cohesion), yet how this occurs in the absence of a bounding lipid membrane is unclear. One model posits that pericentriolar fibres formed from rootletin protein directly link centrioles, yet little is known about the structure, biophysical properties, or assembly kinetics of such fibres. Here, I combine live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged rootletin with cell fusion and find previously unrecognised plasticity in centrosome cohesion. Rootletin forms large, diffusionally stable bifurcating fibres, which amass slowly on mature centrioles over many hours from anaphase. Nascent centrioles (procentrioles), in contrast, do not form roots and must be licensed to do so through polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) activity. Transient separation of roots accompanies centriolar repositioning during the interphase, suggesting that centrioles organize as independent units, each containing discrete roots. Indeed, forced induction of duplicate centriole pairs allows independent reshuffling of individual centrioles between the pairs. Therefore collectively, these findings suggest that progressively nucleated polymers mediate the dynamic association of centrioles as either 1 or 2 interphase centrosomes, with implications for the understanding of how non–membrane-bound organelles self-organise.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/44jiWSXqczI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Mahen&lt;/p&gt;

Sponge-cyanobacteria associations have attracted research interest from an ecological, evolutionary and biotechnological perspective. Current knowledge is, in its majority, “hidden” in metagenomics research studying the entire microbial communities of sponges, while knowledge on these associations is totally missing for certain geographic areas. In this study, we (a) investigated the occurrence of cyanobacteria in 18 sponge species, several of which are studied for the first time for their cyanobionts, from a previously unexplored eastern Mediterranean ecoregion, the Aegean Sea, (b) isolated sponge-associated cyanobacteria, and characterized them based on a polyphasic (morphological-morphometric and molecular phylogenetic analysis) approach, and (c) conducted a meta-analysis on the global diversity of sponge species hosting cyanobacteria, as well as the diversity of cyanobacterial symbionts. Our research provided new records for nine sponge species, previously unknown for this association, while the isolated cyanobacteria were found to form novel clades within &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus&lt;/i&gt;, Leptolyngbyaceae, Pseudanabaenaceae, and Schizotrichaceae, whose taxonomic status requires further investigation; this is the first report of a Schizotrichaceae cyanobacterium associated with sponges. The extensive evaluation of the literature along with the new data from the Aegean Sea raised the number of sponge species known for hosting cyanobacteria to 320 and showed that the cyanobacterial diversity reported from sponges is yet underestimated.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195001</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8308395c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Despoina Konstantinou, Vasilis Gerovasileiou, Eleni Voultsiadou, Spyros Gkelis&lt;/p&gt;

Almost one third of the three million people in China suffering severe deafness are children, and 50% of these cases are believed to have genetic components to their etiology. Newborn hearing genetic screening can complement Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening for the diagnosis of congenital hearing loss as well as identifying children at risk for late-onset and progressive hearing impairment. The aim of this joint academic and Ministry of Health project was to prototype a cost effective newborn genetic screen in a community health setting on a city-wide level, and to ascertain the prevalence of variation at loci that have been associated with non-syndromic hearing loss. With the participation of 143 local hospitals in the city of Wuhan, China we screened 142,417 neonates born between May 2014 and Dec. 2015. The variants GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G, and mitochondrial variants m.1555A&gt;G and m.1494C&gt;T were assayed using real time PCR. Newborns found to carry a variant were re-assayed by sequencing in duplicate. Within a subset of 707 newborns we assayed using real-time PCR and ARMS-PCR to compare cost, sensitivity and operating procedure. The most frequent hearing loss associated allele detected in this population was the 235delC variant in GJB2 gene. In total, 4289 (3.01%) newborns were found to carry at least one allele of either GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G or two assayed MT-RNR1 variants. There was complete accordance between the real-time PCR and the ARMS PCR, though the real-time PCR had a much lower failure rate. Real-time PCR had a lower cost and operating time than ARMS PCR. Ongoing collaboration with the participating hospitals will determine the specificity and sensitivity of the association of the variants with hearing loss at birth and arising in early childhood, allowing an estimation of the benefits of newborn hearing genetic screening in a large-scale community setting.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195740</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>70f1f354</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zongjie Hao, Denggang Fu, Yang Ming, Jinlong Yang, Qi Huang, Weilong Lin, Huan Zhang, Bin Zhang, Aifen Zhou, Xijiang Hu, Cong Yao, Yunping Dong, Huijun Z.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Amino-acids positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly used in the diagnostic workup of patients with gliomas, including differential diagnosis, evaluation of tumor extension, treatment planning and follow-up. Recently, progresses of computer vision and machine learning have been translated for medical imaging. Aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FET) PET lesion detection and segmentation relying on a full 3D U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;All dynamic &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FET PET brain image volumes were temporally realigned to the first dynamic acquisition, coregistered and spatially normalized onto the Montreal Neurological Institute template. Ground truth segmentations were obtained using manual delineation and thresholding (1.3 x background). The volumetric CNN was implemented based on a modified Keras implementation of a U-Net library with 3 layers for the encoding and decoding paths. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used as an accuracy measure of segmentation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-seven patients were included (26 [70%] in the training set and 11 [30%] in the validation set). All 11 lesions were accurately detected with no false positive, resulting in a sensitivity and a specificity for the detection at the tumor level of 100%. After 150 epochs, DSC reached 0.7924 in the training set and 0.7911 in the validation set. After morphological dilatation and fixed thresholding of the predicted U-Net mask a substantial improvement of the DSC to 0.8231 (+ 4.1%) was noted.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Amino-acids positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly used in the diagnostic workup of patients with gliomas, including differential diagnosis, evaluation of tumor extension, treatment planning and follow-up. Recently, progresses of computer vision and machine learning have been translated for medical imaging. Aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FET) PET lesion detection and segmentation relying on a full 3D U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;All dynamic &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FET PET brain image volumes were temporally realigned to the first dynamic acquisition, coregistered and spatially normalized onto the Montreal Neurological Institute template. Ground truth segmentations were obtained using manual delineation and thresholding (1.3 x background). The volumetric CNN was implemented based on a modified Keras implementation of a U-Net library with 3 layers for the encoding and decoding paths. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used as an accuracy measure of segmentation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-seven patients were included (26 [70%] in the training set and 11 [30%] in the validation set). All 11 lesions were accurately detected with no false positive, resulting in a sensitivity and a specificity for the detection at the tumor level of 100%. After 150 epochs, DSC reached 0.7924 in the training set and 0.7911 in the validation set. After morphological dilatation and fixed thresholding of the predicted U-Net mask a substantial improvement of the DSC to 0.8231 (+ 4.1%) was noted. At the voxel level, this segmentation led to a 0.88 sensitivity [95% CI, 87.1 to, 88.2%] a 0.99 specificity [99.9 to 99.9%], a 0.78 positive predictive value: [76.9 to 78.3%], and a 0.99 negative predictive value [99.9 to 99.9%].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;With relatively high performance, it was proposed the first full 3D automated procedure for segmentation of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FET PET brain images of patients with different gliomas using a U-Net CNN architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195798</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Paul Blanc-Durand</name></author><title>Automatic lesion detection and segmentation of &amp;lt;sup&gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&gt;F-FET PET in gliomas: A full 3D U-Net convolutional neural network study</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179362e:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195798</link><published>1523653200000</published></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/320?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Major changes in atmospheric and ocean chemistry occurred in the Paleoproterozoic era (2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago).

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The clinical significance of the laboratory-based phenomenon of clopidogrel hypo-responsiveness and platelet reactivity associated with acute myocardial infarction, despite chronic clopidogrel therapy, is largely unknown. We aimed to determine platelet reactivity and clinical and angiographic features in 29 consecutive patients sustaining an acute myocardial infarction despite chronic (≥1 month) clopidogrel therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Platelet reactivity was determined on admission using conventional aggregometry. All patients underwent coronary angiography within 24 hours of admission. Patients were matched with clopidogrel-naïve acute myocardial infarction patients. Clopidogrel-naïve patients received a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose and 75 mg/day thereafter.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 29 study patients, 19 (66%) presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and in 25% the infarction was related to angiographically-proved definite stent thrombosis. Two-thirds of these patients were poor responders to clopidogrel (adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation &gt;50%) and dual antiplatelet poor responsiveness was found in 57% in the chronic clopidogrel therapy group. Compared with clopidogrel-naïve patients, chronic clopidogrel therapy patients were more likely to demonstrate clopidogrel poor responsiveness (66% versus 38%, p = 0.02), to be diabetic (52% versus 33%, p = 0.1) and to have multi-vessel coronary disease (79% versus 55%, p = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients sustaining acute coronary syndrome despite chronic clopidogrel therapy are more likely to exhibit inadequate platelet inhibition with clopidogrel.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195504</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e6a187c2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ehud Regev, Elad Asher, Paul Fefer, Roy Beigel, Israel Mazin, Shlomi Matetzky, For The Platelets and Thrombosis in Sheba (PLATIS) - Study Group &lt;/p&gt;

Various approaches have been proposed to address the delineation of built-up areas for a wide range of applications. Recently developed approaches are based on the increasing availability of road network data. However, most approaches have employed one or more parameters to divide built-up from non-built-up areas. Very few studies have discussed how to determine appropriate thresholds for such parameters. This study employed an empirical approach for threshold determination, and validated that the approach is applicable for the delineation of built-up areas using road network data. A series of experiments were designed to investigate the most-appropriate thresholds (determined using a similarity measure) for multiple parameters of three existing approaches (street blocks, grid-based, and kernel density) with regard to different administrative regions and cities/towns. The results show that in most cases, the most-appropriate thresholds or ranges for different subdivisions are either identical or overlap—thus validating the use of the most-appropriate thresholds to delineate built-up areas for one or multiple small subdivisions and, by inference, for a much larger region.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194806</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4fd4a592</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qi Zhou, Lei Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Estimating mortality risk during TB treatment in HIV co-infected patients is challenging for health professionals, especially in a low TB prevalence population, due to the lack of a standardized prognostic system. The current study aimed to develop and validate a simple mortality prognostic scoring system for TB/HIV co-infected patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from the CDC’s Tuberculosis Genotyping Information Management System of TB patients in Texas reported from 01/2010 through 12/2016, age ≥15 years, HIV(+), and outcome being “completed” or “died”, we developed and internally validated a mortality prognostic score using multiple logistic regression. Model discrimination was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The model’s good calibration was determined by a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow’s goodness of fit test.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 450 patients included in the analysis, 57 (12.7%) died during TB treatment. The final prognostic score used six characteristics (age, residence in long-term care facility, meningeal TB, chest x-ray, culture positive, and culture not converted/unknown), which are routinely collected by TB programs. Prognostic scores were categorized into three groups that predicted mortality: low-risk (&amp;lt;20 points), medium-risk (20–25 points) and high-risk (&gt;25 points). The model had good discrimination and calibration (AUC = 0.82; 0.80 in bootstrap validation), and a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow test p = 0.71.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our simple validated mortality prognostic scoring system can be a practical tool for health professionals in identifying TB/HIV co-infected patients with high mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196022</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>17467d7c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Duc T.

Adult stem cells often orient their mitotic spindle to place one daughter inside the niche and the other outside of it to achieve asymmetric division. It remains unknown whether and how the niche may direct division orientation. Here we discover a novel and evolutionary conserved mechanism that couples cell polarity to cell fate. We show that the cytokine receptor homolog Dome, acting downstream of the niche-derived ligand Upd, directly binds to the microtubule-binding protein Eb1 to regulate spindle orientation in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; male germline stem cells (GSCs). Dome&apos;s role in spindle orientation is entirely separable from its known function in self-renewal mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway. We propose that integration of two functions (cell polarity and fate) in a single receptor is a key mechanism to ensure an asymmetric outcome following cell division.</description><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33685</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>yukikomy@umich.edu (Aghapi Mordovanakis)</name></author><title>Cytokine receptor-Eb1 interaction couples cell polarity and fate during asymmetric cell division</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522022400000</published><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><engagement>0</engagement><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1626271ac2c:5ab361d:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33685</link><summary><content>Asymmetric stem cell division is a critical mechanism for balancing self-renewal and differentiation.
