Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to summarize and discuss the similarities and differences in inflammatory biomarkers in postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic retrieval of literature up to June 2017 in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, and the Wanfang database was conducted. Extracted data were analyzed with STATA (version 14). The standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of each indicator were calculated using a random effect model. We also performed tests of heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, assessments of bias, and meta-regression in this meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 54 observational studies were included. By meta-analysis we found significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (9 studies, SMD 0.883, 95% CI 0.130 to 1.637, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 10 studies, SMD -0.133, 95% CI -0.512 to 0.246, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.429 in POCD) and interleukin (IL)-6 (7 studies, SMD 0.386, 95% CI 0.054 to 0.717, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 16 studies, SMD 0.089, 95% CI -0.133 to 0.311, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.433 in POCD) concentrations in both POD and POCD patients.

Damaged cartilage has very low regenerative potential which has led to the search for novel tissue-engineering approaches to help treat cartilage defects. While various approaches have been reported, there is no perfect treatment currently. In this study we evaluated the effects of a plant extract, chlorogenic acid (CGA), as part of chondrocyte transplantation on a model of knee joint injury in chicks. First, primary cultured chondrocytes used to evaluate the effects of CGA on chondrogenesis. Then using an articular cartilage injury model of chick knee we assessed the functional recovery after transplantation of the complexes containing chondrocytes and CGA in an alginate scaffold. Histological analysis, PCR, and western blot were further used to understand the underlying mechanisms. We showed that 60 μM CGA in alginate exhibited notable effects on stimulating chondrogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Secondly, it was shown that the application of these complexes accelerated the recovery of injury-induced dysfunction by gait analysis when followed for 21 days. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that there was less abnormal vasculature formation, more chondrocyte proliferation and cartilage matrix synthesis in the presence of the complexes containing CGA. We discovered CGA treated transplantation up-regulated the expressions of Sox9 and Col2a1 which were responsible for the stimulation of chondrogenesis. Furthermore, the application of these complexes could suppress the abnormal angiogenesis and fibrosis at the injury site. Lastly, the elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, p-p65, and MMPs expression were decreased in the presence of CGA. This may be caused through adjusting cellular redox homeostasis associated with Nrf2. This study suggests that combining chondrocytes and CGA on an alginate scaffold can improve the recovery of damaged articular cartilage.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195326</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195326</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Applying chlorogenic acid in an alginate scaffold of chondrocytes can improve the repair of damaged articular cartilage</title><fingerprint>fc2b41b5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xin Cheng, Ke Li, Shengsong Xu, Peizhi Li, Yu Yan, Guang Wang, Zachary Berman, Rui Guo, Jianxin Liang, Sira Traore, Xuesong Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Apigenin can exert beneficial actions in the prevention of obesity. However, its putative action on obesity-associated bowel motor dysfunctions is unknown. This study examined the effects of apigenin on colonic inflammatory and motor abnormalities in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt; Experimental approach &lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). SD or HFD mice were treated with apigenin (10 mg/Kg/day). After 8 weeks, body and epididymal fat weight, as well as cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels were evaluated.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Apigenin can exert beneficial actions in the prevention of obesity. However, its putative action on obesity-associated bowel motor dysfunctions is unknown. This study examined the effects of apigenin on colonic inflammatory and motor abnormalities in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt; Experimental approach &lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). SD or HFD mice were treated with apigenin (10 mg/Kg/day). After 8 weeks, body and epididymal fat weight, as well as cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels were evaluated. Malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1β and IL-6 levels, and &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression were also examined. Colonic infiltration by eosinophils, as well as substance P (SP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions were evaluated. Motor responses elicited under blockade of NOS and tachykininergic contractions were recorded &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; from colonic longitudinal muscle preparations.&lt;/p&gt; Key results &lt;p&gt;When compared to SD mice, HFD animals displayed increased body weight, epididymal fat weight and metabolic indexes.

Until recently, the method of choice to characterize viral diversity consisted in cloning PCR amplicons of full-length viral genomes and Sanger-sequencing of multiple clones. However, this is extremely laborious, time-consuming, and low-throughput. Next generation short-read sequencing appears also limited by its inability to directly sequence full-length viral genomes. The MinION&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; device recently developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies can be a promising alternative by applying long-read single-molecule sequencing directly to the overall amplified products generated in a PCR reaction. This new technology was evaluated by using hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a model. Several previously characterized HBV-infected clinical samples were investigated including recombinant virus, variants that harbored deletions and mixed population. Original MinION device was able to generate individual complete 3,200-nt HBV genome sequences and to identify recombinant variants. MinION was particularly efficient in detecting HBV genomes with multiple large in-frame deletions and spliced variants concomitantly with non-deleted parental genomes. However, an average-12% sequencing error rate per individual reads associated to a low throughput challenged single-nucleotide resolution, polymorphism calling and phasing mutations directly from the sequencing reads. Despite this high error rate, the pairwise identity of MinION HBV consensus genome was consistent with Sanger sequencing method. MinION being under continuous development, further studies are needed to evaluate its potential use for viral infection characterization.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194366</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194366</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Early MinION&amp;lt;sup&gt;™&amp;lt;/sup&gt; nanopore single-molecule sequencing technology enables the characterization of hepatitis B virus genetic complexity in clinical samples</title><fingerprint>afcd0df5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Virginie Sauvage, Laure Boizeau, Daniel Candotti, Mathias Vandenbogaert, Annabelle Servant-Delmas, Valérie Caro, Syria Laperche&lt;/p&gt;

Tubulin isotypes are known to regulate the stability and dynamics of microtubules, and are also involved in the development of resistance against microtubule-targeted cancer drugs. Indanocine, a potent microtubule depolymerizing agent, is highly active against multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells without affecting normal cells. It is known to disrupt microtubule dynamics in cells and induce apoptotic cell death. Indanocine is reported to bind to tubulin at the colchicine site i.e. at the interface of αβ tubulin heterodimer. However, it’s precise binding mode, involved molecular interactions and the binding affinities with different αβ-tubulin isotypes present in MDR cells are not well understood. Here, the binding affinities of human αβ-tubulin isotypes with indanocine were examined, employing the molecular modeling approach i.e. docking, molecular dynamics simulation and binding energy calculations. Multiple sequence analysis suggests that the amino acid sequences are different in the indanocine binding pockets of βI, βIIa, βIII and βVI isotypes. However, such differences are not observed in the amino acid sequences of βIVa, βIVb, and βV tubulin isotypes at indanocine binding pockets. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation results show that indanocine prefers the interface binding pocket of αβIIa, αβIII, αβIVb, αβV, and αβVI tubulin isotypes; whereas it is expelled from the interface binding pocket of αβIVa and αβI-tubulin isotypes. Further, binding free energy calculations show that αβVI has the highest binding affinity and αβI has the lowest binding affinity for indanocine among all β-tubulin isotypes. The binding free energy decreases in the order of αβVI &gt; αβIVb &gt; αβIIa &gt; αβIII &gt; αβV &gt; αβIVa &gt; αβI. Thus, our study provides a significant understanding of involved molecular interactions of indanocine with tubulin isotypes, which may help to design potent indanocine analogues for specific tubulin isotypes in MDR cells in future.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194934</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194934</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Interaction of microtubule depolymerizing agent indanocine with different human αβ tubulin isotypes</title><fingerprint>6be3d66c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bajarang Vasant Kumbhar, Dulal Panda, Ambarish Kunwar&lt;/p&gt;

Here, the binding affinities of human αβ-tubulin isotypes with indanocine were examined, employing the molecular modeling approach i.e. docking, molecular dynamics simulation and binding energy calculations. Multiple sequence analysis suggests that the amino acid sequences are different in the indanocine binding pockets of βI, βIIa, βIII and βVI isotypes. However, such differences are not observed in the amino acid sequences of βIVa, βIVb, and βV tubulin isotypes at indanocine binding pockets. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation results show that indanocine prefers the interface binding pocket of αβIIa, αβIII, αβIVb, αβV, and αβVI tubulin isotypes; whereas it is expelled from the interface binding pocket of αβIVa and αβI-tubulin isotypes. Further, binding free energy calculations show that αβVI has the highest binding affinity and αβI has the lowest binding affinity for indanocine among all β-tubulin isotypes. The binding free energy decreases in the order of αβVI &gt; αβIVb &gt; αβIIa &gt; αβIII &gt; αβV &gt; αβIVa &gt; αβI. Thus, our study provides a significant understanding of involved molecular interactions of indanocine with tubulin isotypes, which may help to design potent indanocine analogues for specific tubulin isotypes in MDR cells in future.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194934</canonicalUrl><updated>1522184400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24213-5</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Christopher Manzella</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24213-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24213-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/UFh6YgA1X7M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24213-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>96</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/UFh6YgA1X7M/s41598-018-24213-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24213-5</link><published>1523948400000</published><title>Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR</title><fingerprint>6a1ae976</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24213-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24213-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/UFh6YgA1X7M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162d2e9416e:304f582:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523956924782</crawled><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>48.0</engagementRate></item><item><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218300632%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D350b850496b9df215bda53bcde90d385</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/24054712</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell Systems</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell Systems&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Stéphane Chevrier, Helena L.

Objective &lt;p&gt;As genomic research gathers momentum in sub-Saharan Africa, it has become increasingly important to understand the reasons why individuals wish to participate in this kind of medical research. Against the background of communitarianism conceived as typical of African communities, it is often suggested that individuals consent to participate on the grounds of solidarity and to further the common good. In this paper, we seek to explore this contention by presenting data from focus groups with potential research participants about what would influence their decisions to participate in genomic research.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;These focus groups were conducted as part of a larger qualitative study with a purposively selected group of participants from a community situated in south west Nigeria. We conducted fifteen focus group sessions comprising 50 participants organized by age and sex, namely: 1) adult (&gt;30 years) males, 2) adult females, 3) youth (18–30 years) males, and 4) youth females. A mixed age-group was conducted to probe different views between the age groups. There was discordance and clear division between the adults and youths regarding the decision to participate in genomic research based on commitment to communal values. Adults based their decision to participate on altruism and furthering the common good while youths based their decisions on personal benefits and preferences and also took into account the views and welfare of family members and neighbours.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This discordance suggests a ‘generational shift’ and we advance a model of ‘relative solidarity’ among the youths, which is different from the communal solidarity model typical of African communitarianism. Our findings suggest the need for a closer look at strategies for implementation of community engagement and informed consent in genomic research in this region, and we recommend further studies to explore this emerging trend.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195171</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195171</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Relative solidarity: Conceptualising communal participation in genomic research among potential research participants in a developing Sub-Saharan African setting</title><fingerprint>8cb246f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Olubunmi Ogunrin, Kerry Woolfall, Mark Gabbay, Lucy Frith&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To explore the relation between cigarette smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness at first diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients diagnosed with urinary bladder cancer (BC) between 1995–2011 under the age of 75 years were retrospectively identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and invited for a study on genetic and lifestyle risk factors for BC. Information on patients’ self-reported smoking history was retrieved by means of a postal questionnaire. Tumors were stratified regarding the risk of progression defined by tumor stage and grade. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the relation between smoking intensity and aggressiveness of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The UBC study population comprised 323 (17.4%) never smokers, 870 (46.8%) former cigarette smokers, and 630 (33.9%) current cigarette smokers. A higher smoking amount was a risk factor of getting high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) compared with low-risk NMIBC in ever and former cigarette smokers (OR: 1.02 per cigarette smoked, 95% CI: 1.00–1.03 and OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.05, respectively). A statistically significant dose-response increase in the risk of a more aggressive cancer type (high-risk NMIBC and MIBC) was observed with increasing smoking duration among former smokers (p for trend 0.035 and 0.008, respectively). No significant association of the evaluated smoking intensity variables was observed in current smokers. A longer time of smoking cessation correlated with a lower odds of a more aggressive cancer.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;We observed a weak increase in the risk of a more aggressive tumor type with increasing smoking intensity in former smokers, but this association was absent in current smokers.This conflicting result may suggest that there is no strong relation between smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness. Analyses of prospective studies with longitudinal smoking assessment may provide a more definitive answer to the research question.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194039</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194039</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness at diagnosis</title><fingerprint>e7bd794</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by André L.

The immune state of wild animals is largely unknown. Knowing this and what affects it is important in understanding how infection and disease affects wild animals. The immune state of wild animals is also important in understanding the biology of their pathogens, which is directly relevant to explaining pathogen spillover among species, including to humans. The paucity of knowledge about wild animals&apos; immune state is in stark contrast to our exquisitely detailed understanding of the immunobiology of laboratory animals. Making an immune response is costly, and many factors (such as age, sex, infection status, and body condition) have individually been shown to constrain or promote immune responses. But, whether or not these factors affect immune responses and immune state in wild animals, their relative importance, and how they interact (or do not) are unknown. Here, we have investigated the immune ecology of wild house mice—the same species as the laboratory mouse—as an example of a wild mammal, characterising their adaptive humoral, adaptive cellular, and innate immune state. Firstly, we show how immune variation is structured among mouse populations, finding that there can be extensive immune discordance among neighbouring populations. Secondly, we identify the principal factors that underlie the immunological differences among mice, showing that body condition promotes and age constrains individuals’ immune state, while factors such as microparasite infection and season are comparatively unimportant. By applying a multifactorial analysis to an immune system-wide analysis, our results bring a new and unified understanding of the immunobiology of a wild mammal.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6q0s1nnNEUE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523653200000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162c02eb7f8:4e48b:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephen Abolins, Luke Lazarou, Laura Weldon, Louise Hughes, Elizabeth C.

BerndHartke</name></author><description>A promising application for design and deployment of molecular machines is nanoscale transport, driven by artificial cilia. In this contribution, we present several further steps toward this goal, beyond our first‐generation artificial cilium (Raeker et al., J. Phys. Chem. A 2012, 116, 11241). Promising new azobenzene‐derivatives were tested for use as cilium motors. Using a QM/MM partitioning in on‐the‐fly photodynamics, excited‐state surface‐hopping trajectories were calculated for each isomerization direction and each motor version. The methods used were reparametrized semiempirical quantum chemistry together with floating‐occupation configuration interaction as the QM part and the OPLSAA‐L forcefield as MM part. In addition, we simulated actual particle transport by a single cilium attached to a model surface, with varying attachment strengths and modes, and with transport targets ranging from single atoms to multi‐molecule arrangements. Our results provide valuable design guidelines for cilia‐driven nanoscale transport and emphasize the need to carefully select the whole setup (not just the cilium itself, but also its surface attachment and the dynamic cilium‐target interaction) to achieve true transport. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25212?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>A promising application for design and deployment of molecular machines is nanoscale transport, driven by artificial cilia.

Our results provide valuable design guidelines for cilia‐driven nanoscale transport and emphasize the need to carefully select the whole setup (not just the cilium itself, but also its surface attachment and the dynamic cilium‐target interaction) to achieve true transport. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25212?af=R</link><published>1521894021000</published><title>Simulations of optically switchable molecular machines for particle transport</title><fingerprint>28512ab0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162956fcc6f:a3d99ed:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522925554799</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195244</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Isaac Jordão de Souza Araújo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Isaac Jordão de Souza Araújo, Andréia Bolzan de Paula, Roberta Caroline Bruschi Alonso, Jesus Roberto Taparelli, Lúcia Helena Innocentini Mei, Rafael Nóbrega Stipp, Regina Maria Puppin-Rontani&lt;/p&gt;
The use of antimicrobial monomers, linked to the polymer chain of resin composites, is an interesting approach to circumvent the effects of bacteria on the dental and material surfaces.

The C-terminus domain of non-structural 3 (NS3) protein of the &lt;i&gt;Flaviviridae&lt;/i&gt; viruses (e.g. HCV, dengue, West Nile, Zika) is a nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) -dependent superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase that unwinds double-stranded RNA while translocating along the nucleic polymer. Due to these functions, NS3 is an important target for antiviral development yet the biophysics of this enzyme are poorly understood. Microsecond-long molecular dynamic simulations of the dengue NS3 helicase domain are reported from which allosteric effects of RNA and NTPase substrates are observed. The presence of a bound single-stranded RNA catalytically enhances the phosphate hydrolysis reaction by affecting the dynamics and positioning of waters within the hydrolysis active site. Coupled with results from the simulations, electronic structure calculations of the reaction are used to quantify this enhancement to be a 150-fold increase, in qualitative agreement with the experimental enhancement factor of 10–100. Additionally, protein-RNA interactions exhibit NTPase substrate-induced allostery, where the presence of a nucleotide (e.g. ATP or ADP) structurally perturbs residues in direct contact with the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA. Residue-residue network analyses highlight pathways of short ranged interactions that connect the two active sites. These analyses identify motif V as a highly connected region of protein structure through which energy released from either active site is hypothesized to move, thereby inducing the observed allosteric effects. These results lay the foundation for the design of novel allosteric inhibitors of NS3.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Tae9aMgOb9I&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d4:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Russell B.

Studies disrupting the chemokine pathway CX3CL1 (fractalkine)/ CX3CR1 have shown decreased atherosclerosis in animal models but the techniques used to interrupt the pathway have not been easily translatable into human trials. DNA vaccination potentially overcomes the translational difficulties. We evaluated the effect of a DNA vaccine, targeted to CX3CR1, on atherosclerosis in a murine model and examined possible mechanisms of action. DNA vaccination against CX3CR1, enhanced by dendritic cell targeting using DEC-205 single chain variable region fragment (scFv), was performed in 8 week old ApoE-/- mice, fed a normal chow diet. High levels of anti-CX3CR1 antibodies were induced in vaccinated mice. There were no apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine. Arterial vessels of 34 week old mice were examined histologically for atherosclerotic plaque size, macrophage infiltration, smooth muscle cell infiltration and lipid deposition. Vaccinated mice had significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque in the brachiocephalic artery. There was less macrophage infiltration but no significant change to the macrophage phenotype in the plaques. There was less lipid deposition in the lesions, but there was no effect on smooth muscle cell migration. Targeted DNA vaccination to CX3CR1 was well tolerated, induced a strong immune response and resulted in attenuated atherosclerotic lesions with reduced macrophage infiltration.

Studies disrupting the chemokine pathway CX3CL1 (fractalkine)/ CX3CR1 have shown decreased atherosclerosis in animal models but the techniques used to interrupt the pathway have not been easily translatable into human trials. DNA vaccination potentially overcomes the translational difficulties. We evaluated the effect of a DNA vaccine, targeted to CX3CR1, on atherosclerosis in a murine model and examined possible mechanisms of action. DNA vaccination against CX3CR1, enhanced by dendritic cell targeting using DEC-205 single chain variable region fragment (scFv), was performed in 8 week old ApoE-/- mice, fed a normal chow diet. High levels of anti-CX3CR1 antibodies were induced in vaccinated mice. There were no apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine. Arterial vessels of 34 week old mice were examined histologically for atherosclerotic plaque size, macrophage infiltration, smooth muscle cell infiltration and lipid deposition. Vaccinated mice had significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque in the brachiocephalic artery. There was less macrophage infiltration but no significant change to the macrophage phenotype in the plaques. There was less lipid deposition in the lesions, but there was no effect on smooth muscle cell migration. Targeted DNA vaccination to CX3CR1 was well tolerated, induced a strong immune response and resulted in attenuated atherosclerotic lesions with reduced macrophage infiltration.

Background &lt;p&gt;Antenatal depression is associated with adverse maternal and infant well-being. However, compared to postpartum depression, it has been less frequently explored globally or in Jamaica. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, antenatal depressive symptoms among Jamaican women in order to inform policy and build interventions that could improve their management and reduce their negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This secondary analysis of data from the second Jamaican Birth Cohort Study (JA-Kids Birth Cohort) included 3,517 women enrolled during pregnancy. Information was extracted from interviewer-administered questionnaires which recorded social, demographic, medical and obstetric information during pregnancy. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS) was used to screen for depression, with scores ≥13 considered indicative of a high likelihood of depression. Bivariate analysis examined associations between depressive symptoms and: age, income, financial difficulties, perceived social support, perceived partner infidelity, previous child-bearing unions and children with the current partner. Obstetric factors were also explored and included gravidity, prior adverse pregnancy outcome and complications from previous pregnancies. Variables that predicted the likelihood of depression based on an EPDS cut score of 13 were evaluated using logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One in five participants (19.6%; 95% CI 18.3–20.9%) had a high likelihood of antenatal depression (EPDS ≥13). Significant predictors of high depressive symptom severity included four indicators of poor perceived social and partner support [ORs (95% CI) ranged from: 1.61 (1.07–2.43); p = 0.024 to 3.14(1.69–5.84); p&amp;lt; 0.001], perceived partner infidelity [1.86 (1.36, 2.54); p&amp;lt;0.001], exposure to violence [2.36 (1.66–3.38); p&amp;lt;0.001] and financial difficulties [1.39 (1.07, 1.80); p = 0.013].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Women’s perceived social and partner support were strongly associated with depressive symptom severity. Within the Jamaican cultural context of unstable reproductive unions, efforts are needed to involve fathers in the antenatal care process to strategically improve the psychological well-being of new mothers which may positively influence long term developmental outcomes for their babies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194338</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194338</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Antenatal depressive symptoms in Jamaica associated with limited perceived partner and other social support: A cross-sectional study</title><fingerprint>9a39ecbf</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Omotayo Bernard, Roger C.

When unifying genomic resources among studies and comparing data between species, there is often no better resource than a genome sequence. Having a reference genome for the Chinook salmon (&lt;i&gt;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&lt;/i&gt;) will enable the extensive genomic resources available for Pacific salmon, Atlantic salmon, and rainbow trout to be leveraged when asking questions related to the Chinook salmon. The Chinook salmon’s wide distribution, long cultural impact, evolutionary history, substantial hatchery production, and recent wild-population decline make it an important research species. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the genome of a Chilliwack River Hatchery female Chinook salmon (gynogenetic and homozygous at all loci). With a reference genome sequence, new questions can be asked about the nature of this species, and its role in a rapidly changing world.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195461</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195461</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Chinook salmon (&amp;lt;i&gt;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&amp;lt;/i&gt;) genome and transcriptome</title><fingerprint>73fbc1ab</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kris A.

Variation in cortical connectivity profiles is typically modeled as having a coarse spatial scale parcellated into interconnected brain areas. We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PKWzqyJ_2Tk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523998800000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162d4ba762b:4bed5d:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Whether metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals are at increased risk of ischemic stroke is not well known. We investigated the association of the MHO phenotype with ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 354,083 adults (age 45.8 ± 14.2 years) from the Korean National Health Insurance Service–National Sample Cohort enrolled in 2004–2008 were followed-up for incident ischemic stroke until 2013. Subjects meeting none of the metabolic syndrome criteria were classified as ‘metabolically healthy’. The cohort was categorized into four groups according to obesity and metabolic status: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), MHO, and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke was newly diagnosed in 4,884 (1.4%) individuals during a mean follow-up of 7.4 ± 1.5 years. Stroke incidence rates for the MHNW, MUNW, MHO, and MUO groups were 0.56, 2.61, 0.61, and 2.76 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. While risk for stroke increased significantly in metabolically unhealthy groups, it was not increased in MHO compared to the MHNW group on multivariate analysis. In metabolically healthy individuals, obesity did not increase the risk for ischemic stroke, regardless of the severity of obesity. Meanwhile, in metabolically unhealthy individuals, being obese was significantly associated with increased risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MHO individuals were not at increased risk for ischemic stroke. However, obesity increased risk for ischemic stroke in persons with metabolic risk factors; therefore, maintaining normal weight may be more important for this population.

Protein trafficking within cilia is mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery composed of large protein complexes. The BBSome consists of eight BBS proteins encoded by causative genes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and has been implicated in the trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), by connecting the IFT machinery to cargo GPCRs. Membrane recruitment of the BBSome to promote cargo trafficking has been proposed to be regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase ARL6/BBS3, through its interaction with the BBS1 subunit of the BBSome. We here investigated how the BBSome core subcomplex composed of BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 assembles and interacts with ARL6, and found that the ARL6–BBS1 interaction is reinforced by BBS9. &lt;i&gt;BBS1&lt;/i&gt;-knockout (KO) cells showed defects in the ciliary entry of other BBSome subunits and ARL6, and in ciliary retrograde trafficking and the export of the GPCRs, Smoothened and GPR161. The trafficking defect of these GPCRs was rescued by the exogenous expression of wild-type BBS1, but not by its mutant lacking BBS9-binding ability. Our data thus indicate that the intact BBSome is required for retrograde trafficking of GPCRs out of cilia.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195005</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195005</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>BBS1 is involved in retrograde trafficking of ciliary GPCRs in the context of the BBSome complex</title><fingerprint>761ea815</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shohei Nozaki, Yohei Katoh, Takuya Kobayashi, Kazuhisa Nakayama&lt;/p&gt;

The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-seq, coupled with transcription-factor motif analysis, provides indirect evidence of chromatin binding for hundreds of TFs genome-wide. Here, we propose methods for TRN inference in a mammalian setting, using ATAC-seq data to influence gene expression modeling.

In this resource-rich mammalian setting our extensive benchmarking provides quantitative, genome-scale evaluation of TRN inference combining ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data. We refine and extend our previous Th17 TRN, using our new TRN inference methods to integrate all Th17 data (gene expression, ATAC-seq, TF KO, ChIP-seq). We highlight new roles for individual TFs and groups of TFs (&amp;quot;TF-TF modules&amp;quot;) in Th17 gene regulation. Given the popularity of ATAC-seq, which provides high-resolution with low sample input requirements, we anticipate that application of our methods will improve TRN inference in new mammalian systems, especially in vivo, for cells directly from humans and animal models.</description><engagement>19</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292987v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292987v1?rss=1</link><published>1522566000000</published><title>Leveraging chromatin accessibility for transcriptional regulatory network inference in T Helper 17 Cells [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>bbfdc5c9</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) provide insight into cellular behavior by describing interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their gene targets.

Given the popularity of ATAC-seq, which provides high-resolution with low sample input requirements, we anticipate that application of our methods will improve TRN inference in new mammalian systems, especially in vivo, for cells directly from humans and animal models.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/01/292987</canonicalUrl><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16282012d40:863b2a0:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522599537984</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/069104v3?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><author><name>Ashtiani, M.</name></author><description>IMMAN is a software for reconstructing Interolog Protein Network (IPN) by integrating several Protein-protein Interaction Networks (PPINs).

Objective &lt;p&gt;Individuals with metabolic syndrome have increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to test the hypothesis that a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CR-fitness), counteracts accumulation of visceral fat, decreases inflammation and lowers risk factors of the metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;The study sample included 1,293 Danes (age 49–52 years) who from 2009 to 2011 participated in the Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank, including a questionnaire, physical tests, and blood samples. Multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and plasma levels of cytokines and high sensitive C-reactive protein as outcomes and measures of abdominal obesity were added to test if they explained the potential association. Similarly, multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and factors of the metabolic syndrome as outcomes and the potential explanation by inflammatory biomarkers were tested. All models were adjusted for the effect of age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, socio-economic status, and acute inflammatory events within the preceding two weeks.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;CR-fitness was inversely associated with high sensitive C-reactive protein, Interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-18, and directly associated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but not associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma or IL-1β. Abdominal obesity could partly explain the significant associations. Moreover, CR-fitness was inversely associated with an overall metabolic syndrome score, as well as triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin A&lt;sub&gt;1c&lt;/sub&gt;, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and directly associated with high-density lipoprotein. Single inflammatory biomarkers and a combined inflammatory score partly explained these associations.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Data suggest that CR-fitness has anti-inflammatory effects that are partly explained by a reduction in abdominal obesity and a decrease in the metabolic syndrome risk profile. The overall inflammatory load was mainly driven by high sensitive C-reactive protein and IL-6.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194991</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194991</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Cardiorespiratory fitness and the metabolic syndrome: Roles of inflammation and abdominal obesity</title><fingerprint>891b71d8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anne-Sophie Wedell-Neergaard, Rikke Krogh-Madsen, Gitte Lindved Petersen, Åse Marie Hansen, Bente Klarlund Pedersen, Rikke Lund, Helle Bruunsgaard&lt;/p&gt;

The Florida manatee (&lt;i&gt;Trichechus manatus latirotris&lt;/i&gt;) is a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirus-induced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three G-tetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all TmPVs, G4 sequences were located in the non-coding region near putative E2 binding sites. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are possible regulatory elements in TmPVs.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195625</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195625</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>Identification of G-quadruplex forming sequences in three manatee papillomaviruses</title><fingerprint>e617e4f8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maryam Zahin, William L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used as disease modifying treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Rheumatological and dermatological guidelines to prevent MTX-induced adverse events diverge in the number and frequency of blood tests. These differences are not based on evidence indicating a higher risk for patients with psoriasis compared to PsA or rheumatic arthritis (RA). This raises the question if multiple testing increases safety, or results in false positive signals potentially leading to early withdrawal of an effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;Compare the effects of MTX monitoring strategies by rheumatologists and dermatologists regarding drug survival, reasons for withdrawal and safety.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective follow-up of all patients diagnosed with psoriasis by dermatologists or PsA by rheumatologists. Included were consecutive patients who started methotrexate (MTX) between 2006 and 2012 and had a scheduled follow-up by dermatologist or rheumatologist. Exclusions were: drug not started after the first prescription or incomplete availability of lab data. Data were extracted from electronic records: start and stop dates and dosing of MTX; treatment with folic acid and dose; reasons for withdrawal of MTX; numbers of blood sampling and types of laboratory tests performed for MTX safety; number of abnormal tests; occurrence of any serious adverse event (SAE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;190 Psoriasis and 196 PsA patients starting methotrexate (MTX) were included. Age and sex were comparable. PsA patients used higher initial and maximum doses of MTX and folic acid, but psoriasis patients had a higher frequency of abnormal laboratory results (0.14 vs 0.03 per treatment month, p&amp;lt;0.001), resulting in a striking difference in withdrawal of MTX for abnormal liver enzymes (15.8% vs 3.6%, p&amp;lt;0.001). In PsA patients MTX was withdrawn less frequently for ineffectiveness (15.8 vs 24.2%, p&amp;lt;0.05) leading to longer drug survival in the first course of treatment (37.4±30 vs 18.8±19.1 months). Repeated courses of MTX were more often prescribed by rheumatologists than by dermatologists. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of SAE (psoriasis 0.0041 vs PsA 0.0038 per treatment month) or death (1.6% vs 2.0%) between these groups. Hospital admissions related to infection were recorded in 6 (3.1%) PsA vs 4 (2.1%) psoriasis patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Strict monitoring by dermatologists resulted in more abnormal findings, which reduced drug survival of MTX. The limited monitoring strategy by rheumatologists was not associated with more SAEs. Further research in other populations is needed to confirm whether reduced intensity of monitoring can optimize the use of MTX with sufficient long-term safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194401</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194401</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Dermatological guidelines for monitoring methotrexate treatment reduce drug-survival compared to rheumatological guidelines</title><fingerprint>aeb1b2e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Felien T.

Further research in other populations is needed to confirm whether reduced intensity of monitoring can optimize the use of MTX with sufficient long-term safety.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194401</canonicalUrl><updated>1521838800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51c5:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03162-7</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Hyunho Kim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adsorption-based atmospheric water harvesting device for arid climates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adsorption-based atmospheric water harvesting device for arid climates, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03162-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03162-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Harvesting water from the atmosphere is an important solution to water scarcity, but doing so in arid climates is highly challenging.

Landscape connectivity is integral to the persistence of metapopulations of wide ranging carnivores and other terrestrial species. The objectives of this research were to investigate the landscape characteristics essential to use of areas by lynx and bobcats in northern New England, map a habitat availability model for each species, and explore connectivity across areas of the region likely to experience future development pressure. A Mahalanobis distance analysis was conducted on location data collected between 2005 and 2010 from 16 bobcats in western Vermont and 31 lynx in northern Maine to determine which variables were most consistent across all locations for each species using three scales based on average 1) local (15 minute) movement, 2) linear distance between daily locations, and 3) female home range size. The bobcat model providing the widest separation between used locations and random study area locations suggests that they cue into landscape features such as edge, availability of cover, and development density at different scales. The lynx model with the widest separation between random and used locations contained five variables including natural habitat, cover, and elevation—all at different scales. Shrub scrub habitat—where lynx’s preferred prey is most abundant—was represented at the daily distance moved scale. Cross validation indicated that outliers had little effect on models for either species. A habitat suitability value was calculated for each 30 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; pixel across Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine for each species and used to map connectivity between conserved lands within selected areas across the region. Projections of future landscape change illustrated potential impacts of anthropogenic development on areas lynx and bobcat may use, and indicated where connectivity for bobcats and lynx may be lost. These projections provided a guide for conservation of landscape permeability for lynx, bobcat, and species relying on similar habitats in the region.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194243</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194243</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Landscape connectivity for bobcat (&amp;lt;i&gt;Lynx rufus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) and lynx (&amp;lt;i&gt;Lynx canadensis&amp;lt;/i&gt;) in the Northeastern United States</title><fingerprint>bba0808e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Laura E.

Here, we describe TBtools, a Toolkit for Biologists integrating various HTS-data handling tools with a user-friendly interface. It includes a large collection of functions, which facilitate many simple, routine but elaborate tasks working on HTS data, such as bulk sequence extraction, gene set functional enrichment, venn diagram and etc. TBtools can run under all operating systems with JRE1.6 and is freely available at github.com/CJ-Chen/TBtools. Since its development, it has been used by many researchers.

Here, we describe TBtools, a Toolkit for Biologists integrating various HTS-data handling tools with a user-friendly interface. It includes a large collection of functions, which facilitate many simple, routine but elaborate tasks working on HTS data, such as bulk sequence extraction, gene set functional enrichment, venn diagram and etc. TBtools can run under all operating systems with JRE1.6 and is freely available at github.com/CJ-Chen/TBtools. Since its development, it has been used by many researchers. It will be a useful toolkit for wet-lab biologists to work on all kinds of high-throughput data.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/289660</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1626974e1ed:6437fe0:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522187690477</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194686</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Marta Miragall</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marta Miragall, Ernestina Etchemendy, Ausiàs Cebolla, Víctor Rodríguez, Carlos Medrano, Rosa María Baños&lt;/p&gt;
Mirror exposure (ME) is one of the main components of the treatment of patients with eating disorders symptomatology and it has shown its effectiveness in improving several outcomes (e.g., body dissatisfaction). However, the study as to what body posture should be adopted to maximize its effectiveness has been neglected. From embodied cognition and emotion theories, the adoption of an expansive (vs. contractive) body posture has been associated with positive changes in cognitive and emotional responses. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of adopting an expansive (vs. contractive) posture before an ME task on body-related emotions and cognitions, as well as to analyze the possible moderator and mediator variables of these relationships. The sample was composed of 68 women (age: &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 21.74, &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 3.12) with high scores on body dissatisfaction. Participants were randomly assigned to the expansive or contractive condition, where the openness of the arms/legs and the back position were manipulated. Posture was monitored by an electronic device and participants filled out several self-reported measures. ANCOVAs, moderation, mediation, and moderated mediated analyses were performed. Results showed that women in the expansive condition showed higher positive emotions after the ME. Moreover, exploratory analyses showed that adopting an expansive posture improved positive emotions, leading to improvements in negative emotions, body image satisfaction, and appraisal of the person’s own body. Psychological interventions should explore the value of holding an expansive posture before the ME in women with body dissatisfaction.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194686</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194686</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Expand your body when you look at yourself: The role of the posture in a mirror exposure task</title><fingerprint>9fac8bb9</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marta Miragall, Ernestina Etchemendy, Ausiàs Cebolla, Víctor Rodríguez, Carlos Medrano, Rosa María Baños&lt;/p&gt;

Adverse event (AE)-related costs represent an important component of economic models for cancer care. However, since previous studies mostly focused on specific AEs, treatments, or cancer types, limited information is currently available. Therefore, this study assessed the incremental healthcare costs associated with a large number of AEs among patients diagnosed with some of the most prevalent types of cancer. Data were obtained from a large US claims database. Adult patients were included if diagnosed with and treated for one of the following cancer types: breast, digestive organs and peritoneum, genitourinary organs (including bladder and ovary and other uterine adnexa), lung, lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue, and skin. Treatment episodes were defined as the period from initiation of the first antineoplastic pharmacologic therapy to discontinuation (i.e., gap of ≥ 45 days), or change in treatment regimen, or end of data availability. A total of 36 AEs were selected from the product inserts of 104 treatments recommended by practice guidelines. A retrospective matched cohort design was used, matching a treatment episode with a certain AE with a treatment episode without that AE. A total of 412,005 patients were selected, for a total of 794,243 treatment episodes, resulting in 1,617,368 matched treatment episodes across all 36 AEs. Incremental healthcare costs associated with AEs of any severity ranged from $546 for cough/upper respiratory infections to $24,633 for gastrointestinal perforation. The three most costly AEs when considering any severity were gastrointestinal perforation ($24,633), central nervous system hemorrhage ($24,322), and sepsis/septicemia ($23,510). Incremental healthcare costs associated with severe AEs ranged from $15,709 for dermatitis and rash to $48,538 for gastrointestinal fistula. The three most costly severe AEs were gastrointestinal fistula ($48,538), gastrointestinal perforation ($41,281), and central nervous system hemorrhage ($38,428). In conclusion, AEs during treatment episodes for cancer were frequent and associated with a substantial economic burden.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196007</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196007</link><published>1523653200000</published><title>Assessment of costs associated with adverse events in patients with cancer</title><fingerprint>1d64ea7d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by William Wong, Yeun Mi Yim, Ashley Kim, Martin Cloutier, Marjolaine Gauthier-Loiselle, Patrick Gagnon-Sanschagrin, Annie Guerin&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, an increasing popularity of marathons has been seen. Although running has been shown to have considerable positive health effects, the risk of sudden death, most often due to sudden cardiac arrests, is also a risk runners expose themselves to. Whilst there are some studies on the mortality amongst long-distance runners, much of the evidence is dated. Given the increased popularity in running during the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century as well as the improvements in medical care at marathons, more knowledge is required on the mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and method &lt;p&gt;Publicly available racing and news databases were used to identify the number of entrants and finishers in half to full marathons in Sweden between 2007 and 2016 and the number of deaths that occurred in conjunction with the races.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,156,271 runners entered a long distance (21-42km) running race in Sweden between 2007 and 2016, and 834,412 runners finished the races (72.2%). A large majority of the finishers (677,050 (81%)) competed in distances under a full marathon. Two deaths occurred during the time period, meaning that the death rate was 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.04–0.79) per 100,000 finishers.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study can show that death rates in long distance running races between 2007 and 2016 in Sweden are very low, compared to previous studies.

J.</name></author><description>Metabolic adaptations accompanying the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria remain poorly understood. To interrogate this relationship, we profiled the growth of lab-evolved antibiotic-resistant lineages of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa across 190 unique carbon sources. We semi-automatically calculated growth dynamics (maximum growth density, growth rate, and time to mid-exponential phase) of over 2,800 growth curves. These data revealed that the evolution of antibiotic resistance resulted in systems-level changes to growth dynamics and metabolic phenotype. Drug-resistant lineages predominantly displayed decreased growth relative to the ancestral lineage; however, resistant lineages occasionally displayed enhanced growth on certain carbon sources, indicating that adaption to drug can provide a growth advantage in certain environments. A genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction (GENRE) of P. aeruginosa strain UCBPP-PA14 was paired with whole-genome sequencing data of one of the drug-evolved lineages to predict genes contributing to observed changes in metabolism.

To interrogate this relationship, we profiled the growth of lab-evolved antibiotic-resistant lineages of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa across 190 unique carbon sources. We semi-automatically calculated growth dynamics (maximum growth density, growth rate, and time to mid-exponential phase) of over 2,800 growth curves. These data revealed that the evolution of antibiotic resistance resulted in systems-level changes to growth dynamics and metabolic phenotype. Drug-resistant lineages predominantly displayed decreased growth relative to the ancestral lineage; however, resistant lineages occasionally displayed enhanced growth on certain carbon sources, indicating that adaption to drug can provide a growth advantage in certain environments. A genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction (GENRE) of P. aeruginosa strain UCBPP-PA14 was paired with whole-genome sequencing data of one of the drug-evolved lineages to predict genes contributing to observed changes in metabolism. Finally, we experimentally validated in silico predictions to identify genes mutated in resistant P. aeruginosa affecting loss of catabolic function. Our results build upon previous mechanistic knowledge of drug-induced metabolic adaptation and provide a framework for the identification of metabolic limitations in antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Robust drug-driven changes in bacterial metabolism have the potential to be exploited to select against antibiotic-resistant populations in chronic infections.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/18/303289</canonicalUrl><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162d8146515:38d3cb0:34f43e70</id><crawled>1524043638037</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294025v1?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Wang, L.</name></author><description>The solvent-excluded surface (SES) of a molecule is an important geometrical property relevant to its solvation in aqueous solution and its interactions with other molecules.

Recent studies have suggested reduced independent and sensitive parameter sets for stabilometry measurements based on correlation and variance analyses. However, the reliability of these recommended parameter sets has not been studied in the literature or not in every stance type used in stabilometry assessments, for example, single leg stances. The goal of this study is to evaluate the test-retest reliability of different time-based and frequency-based parameters that are calculated from the center of pressure (CoP) during bipedal and single leg stance for 30- and 60-second measurement intervals. Thirty healthy subjects performed repeated standing trials in a bipedal stance with eyes open and eyes closed conditions and in a single leg stance with eyes open for 60 seconds. A force distribution measuring plate was used to record the CoP. The reliability of the CoP parameters was characterized by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), coefficient of variation (CV) and CV compliance rate (CVCR). Based on the ICC, SEM and MDC results, many parameters yielded fair to good reliability values, while the CoP path length yielded the highest reliability (smallest ICC &gt; 0.67 (0.54–0.79), largest SEM% = 19.2%). Usually, frequency type parameters and extreme value parameters yielded poor reliability values. There were differences in the reliability of the maximum CoP velocity (better with 30 seconds) and mean power frequency (better with 60 seconds) parameters between the different sampling intervals.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195995</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195995</link><published>1523998800000</published><title>Reliability analysis of a sensitive and independent stabilometry parameter set</title><fingerprint>9fea8b84</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gergely Nagymáté, Zsanett Orlovits, Rita M.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies are becoming routinely used for the detection of novel and clinically actionable DNA variants at a pangenomic scale. Such analyses are now used in the clinical practice to enable precision medicine. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are still one of the most abundant source of cancer clinical specimen, unfortunately this method of preparation is known to degrade DNA and therefore compromise subsequent analysis. Some studies have reported that variant detection can be performed on FFPE samples sequenced with NGS techniques, but few or none have done an in-depth coverage analysis and compared the influence of different state-of-the-art FFPE DNA extraction kits on the quality of the variant calling. Here, we generated 42 human whole-exome sequencing data sets from fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE samples. These samples include normal and tumor tissues from two different organs (liver and colon), that we extracted with three different FFPE extraction kits (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and GeneRead DNA FFPE kit from Qiagen, Maxwell&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; RSC DNA FFPE Kit from Promega). We determined the rate of concordance of called variants between matched FF and FFPE samples on all common variants (representing at least 86% of the total number of variants for SNVs). The concordance rate is very high between all matched FF / FFPE pairs, with equivalent values for the three kits we analyzed. On the other hand, when looking at the difference between the total number of variants in FF and FFPE, we find a significant variation for the three different FFPE DNA extraction kits. Coverage analysis shows that FFPE samples have less good indicators than FF samples, yet the coverage quality remains above accepted thresholds. We detect limited but statistically significant variations in coverage indicator values between the three FFPE extraction kits. Globally, the GeneRead and QIAamp kits have better variant calling and coverage indicators than the Maxwell kit on the samples used in this study, although this kit performs better on some indicators and has advantages in terms of practical usage. Taken together, our results confirm the potential of FFPE samples analysis for clinical genomic studies, but also indicate that the choice of a FFPE DNA extraction kit should be done with careful testing and analysis beforehand in order to maximize the accuracy of the results.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195471</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195471</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Performance comparison of three DNA extraction kits on human whole-exome data from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal and tumor samples</title><fingerprint>d03d05e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Bonnet, Marie-Laure Moutet, Céline Baulard, Delphine Bacq-Daian, Florian Sandron, Lilia Mesrob, Bertrand Fin, Marc Delépine, Marie-Ange Palomares, Claire Jubin, Hélène Blanché, Vincent Meyer, Anne Boland, Robert Olaso, Jean-François Deleuze&lt;/p&gt;

The authors are going over a number of areas where medicinal chemistry could make use of more advanced synthetic techniques, and they’re good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, “&lt;em&gt;From an industry perspective, the most common challenge for any new synthetic method is its level of tolerance to the polar functional groups and nitrogen heteroatoms found in biologically active molecules.&lt;/em&gt;” Yes indeed. That’s what I look at when I see a neat new transformation in the literature – what did it work on? Basic amines OK? Tertiary or secondary? Secondary amides tolerated? Carboxylic acids? Free OH groups? I’m disappointed sometimes when I find that a reaction can’t tolerate these, but I’m glad that the papers involved at least went to the trouble of finding the limits to their chemistry. Far worse than that is a paper that tiptoes around the issues of chemical compatibility, leaving you to find out for yourself – if you’re so inclined, and often one is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area identified is late-stage functionalization, C-H bond activation, etc. Those reactions are always welcome, for sure. Chemical diversity is one of the names of the game that we play, and anything that allows us to get more of it quickly and reliably is good news. Blending with the above, the more complex and functionalized the molecules that can be used as substrates for such chemistry, the better. We’ll take fluorination, hydroxylation, amination, addition of methoxy, trifluoromethyl, what have you. It’s great to be able to predict where the functionalization will happen, of course, but there’s value in things that just sort of go in and mess with structures, too: new molecules! After all, that’s what the liver enzymes do to our drugs; we’re used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also calls for new ways to synthesize and functionalize small heterocyclic rings, new metal-catalyzed coupling reactions (and new C-C bond-forming reactions in general), more biomolecule-compatible reactions, and more. It also goes briefly into machine-assisted synthesis and software-assisted retrosynthesis, but the bulk of the paper is on synthetic methods, and I can only cheer on their suggestions. These are all potential areas for academic-industrial collaboration to generate new chemistry, because everyone benefits from success in these areas (indeed, some of this collaboration goes on already for just these reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I enjoyed this paper very much, but it starts off with a claim that’s worth arguing about: “&lt;em&gt;organic synthesis is still a rate-limiting factor in drug-discovery projects&lt;/em&gt;“. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on where you’re standing. All the synthetic limitations described above are real, and they keep us from being able to make a lot of molecules that we’d otherwise be cranking out. But (and this is a big point) it’s rarely the case that we medicinal chemists identify a tricky new structure that absolutely has to be made. That sounds odd, but it comes down to our predictive powers, which aren’t so great. We don’t generally draw some wild compound up on the hood sash and say “That’s the one, folks: find a way to make it or die trying”. We never know which is the one, so in the absence of knowing, we make the things that we can make in the ways that we can make them, and honestly, much of the time, we can manage to come up with something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, though, things like the ability to make more polar compounds reliably and quickly would probably lead to better and more structurally diverse drug candidates and screening compounds, not to mention better starting points for projects in general. We just don’t know which ones. The main examples of specific compounds I can think of are metabolites or potential metabolites, where the liver has made some new polar compound out of an existing drug candidate, and we need to make the new compound(s) for testing. Those can be tough, and sometimes the only way is to grind out small quantities by exposing the drug to liver tissue itself (!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for times we can’t come up with something, I would like to believe that far more diverse and interesting sets of compounds, millions of them, would allow for real hits to be found against target classes that we currently have trouble attacking. But that remains to be proven, if it ever can be. Chemical space is so large that you can always say “Well, your compound set still wasn’t big enough – the good ones are still out there”, and there’s no way to say that’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the real killers in drug discovery stem from – to put it mildly – our incomplete understanding of biology. It’s Phase II and Phase III failures that hammer us, and those happen because we don’t understand our desirable (and undesirable) mechanisms of action enough, leading to failures in efficacy and safety. Even worse, they come after a big pile of money has been spent. Compared to these problems, generating chemical matter is not as big a concern. We already generate enough chemical matter to send all sorts of stuff into the clinic, where 80 to 90% of it dies for other reasons entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic chemistry is, of course, crucial to making small-molecule drugs, and you’d think that would be enough. But as a chemist, I wish that organic synthesis were more relevant to these deep problems. But in the big picture, it isn’t quite so. Chemical biology, as a field, is an attempt to make that happen, but How to Make will never be able to answer questions of What to Make and Why.&lt;/p&gt;

Bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) is one experimental model of vascular dementia thought to preferentially impact brain white matter. Indeed, few studies report hippocampal and cortical pathology prior to 30 days post-stenosis; though it is unclear whether those studies examined regions outside the white matter. Since changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability precede more overt brain pathology in various diseases, we hypothesized that changes within the BBB and/or BBB-associated extracellular matrix (ECM) could occur earlier after BCAS in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum and be a precursor of longer term pathology. Here, C57Bl/6 mice underwent BCAS or sham surgeries and changes in the BBB and ECM were analyzed by collagen IV (vascular basement membrane component), α5 integrin (marker of endothelial activation), claudin-5 and occludin (tight junction proteins), Evans blue (permeability marker), Ki-67 (cell proliferation marker), and GFAP and CD11b (glial cell markers) immunohistochemistry after 14 days. Significant changes in markers of cerebrovascular integrity and glial activation were detected, not only in the striatum, but also in the hippocampus and cortex. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that changes in the BBB/ECM occur shortly after BCAS and within multiple brain regions and suggests such changes might underlie the gradual development of BCAS non-white matter pathology.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195765</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195765</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Bilateral carotid artery stenosis causes unexpected early changes in brain extracellular matrix and blood-brain barrier integrity in mice</title><fingerprint>a5fc01f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jill M.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that changes in the BBB/ECM occur shortly after BCAS and within multiple brain regions and suggests such changes might underlie the gradual development of BCAS non-white matter pathology.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195765</canonicalUrl><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66c5:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00202</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acscii</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>ACS Central Science: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Sam Lemonick</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00202/20180413/images/medium/oc-2018-002029_0001.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00202&lt;/div&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00202</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00202/20180413/images/medium/oc-2018-002029_0001.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00202&lt;/div&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00202</link><published>1523592000000</published><title>[ASAP] Looking for Finland’s Future in Its Forests</title><fingerprint>413b9a37</fingerprint><id>1TYkl+7D2jbCAjv6kqe9qy39+K76tsp7YKV/mQVt7ps=_162bfe2fa5d:454aec:76251cdd</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00202/20180413/images/medium/oc-2018-002029_0001.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><height>346</height></visual><crawled>1523637746269</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195703</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Yaoqi Ge</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yaoqi Ge, Yuejiao Zhong, Guozhong Ji, Qianling Lu, Xinyu Dai, Zhirui Guo, Peng Zhang, Gang Peng, Kangzhen Zhang, Yuntao Li&lt;/p&gt;

In contrast, biological enzymes with Brønsted acidic sites of appropriate strength can protonate olefins and thereby generate carbocations that ultimately react to form natural products.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke, is linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is characterized by SUR1-TRPM4 (sulfonylurea receptor 1—transient receptor potential melastatin 4) channel upregulation in microvascular endothelium. In humans and rodents with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), the SUR1 antagonist, glibenclamide, reduces hemorrhagic transformation and plasma MMP-9, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that tPA induces protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-mediated, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium, and that SUR1-TRPM4 is required for this process.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R, of 2 and 4 hours duration, respectively, was obtained using conventional middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunolabeling was used to quantify p65 nuclear translocation. Murine and human brain endothelial cells (BEC) were studied &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, without and with NF-κB activation, using immunoblot, zymography and ELISA, patch clamp electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations were used to identify signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R caused prominent nuclear translocation of p65 in microvascular endothelium. NF-κB-activation of BEC caused &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; expression of SUR1-TRPM4 channels. In NF-κB-activated BEC: (i) tPA caused opening of SUR1-TRPM4 channels in a plasmin-, PAR1-, TRPC3- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner; (ii) tPA caused PAR1-dependent secretion of MMP-9; (iii) tonic secretion of MMP-9 by activated BEC was not influenced by SUR1 inhibition; (iv) phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA or the PAR1-agonist, TFLLR, required functional SUR1-TRPM4 channels, with inhibition of SUR1 decreasing tPA-induced MMP-9 secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;tPA induces PAR1-mediated, SUR1-TRPM4-dependent, phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195526</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195526</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>SUR1-TRPM4 channel activation and phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA in brain endothelial cells</title><fingerprint>c656222e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Volodymyr Gerzanich, Min Seong Kwon, Seung Kyoon Woo, Alexander Ivanov, J.

Scant research is available on the impact of the current economic crisis and austerity policies on inequality in health services utilisation in Europe. This study aimed to describe the trends in horizontal inequity in the use of health services in Andalusia, Spain, during the early years of the Great Recession, and the contribution of demographic, economic and social factors. Consultation with a general practitioner (GP) and specialist, hospitalisation and emergency care were studied through the Andalusian Health Survey 2007 (pre-crisis) and 2011–2012 (crisis), using a composite income index as socioeconomic status (SES) indicator. Horizontal inequity indices (HII) were calculated to take differential healthcare needs into account, and a decomposition analysis of change in inequality between periods was performed. Results showed that before the crisis, the HII was positive (greater access for people with higher SES) for specialist visits but negative (greater access for people with lower SES) in the other three utilisation models. During the crisis no change was observed in inequalities in GP visits, but a pro-poor development was seen for the other types of utilisation, with hospital and emergency care showing significant inequality in favour of low income groups. Overall, the main contributors to pro-poor changes in utilisation were socio-economic variables and poor mental health, due to changes in their elasticities. Our findings show that inequalities in healthcare utilisation largely remained in favour of the less well-off, despite the cuts in welfare benefits and health services provision during the early years of the recession in Andalusia. Further research is needed to monitor the potential impact of such measures in subsequent years.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195293</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195293</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>Withstanding austerity: Equity in health services utilisation in the first stage of the economic recession in Southern Spain</title><fingerprint>d99bca9c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Antonio Córdoba-Doña, Antonio Escolar-Pujolar, Miguel San Sebastián, Per E.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an increasing public health concern because of rapid lifestyle changes. Although there have been previous studies on the prevalence of MS in China, the prevalence may have changed with lifestyle changes over the last decade. To update this prevalence, we performed a cross-sectional survey among adults over 18 years old across China from May 2013 to July 2014. Participants underwent questionnaires and provided blood and urine samples for analysis. MS was defined according to the criteria of the China Diabetes Society. A total of 12570 individuals (45.2% men) with an average age of 48.8±15.3 (18–96) years were selected and invited to participate in the study. In total, 9310 (40.7% men) individuals completed the investigation, with a response rate of 74.1%. The prevalence of MS in China was 14.39% [95% confidence interval (CI): -3.75–32.53%], and the age-adjusted prevalence was 9.82% (95% CI: 9.03–10.61%; 7.78% in men and 6.76% in women; 7.39% in rural residents and 6.98% in urban residents). The highest prevalence occurred among adults aged 50–59 years (1.95%, 95% CI: 1.40–2.50%), and the lowest prevalence occurred among adults aged 40–49 years (0.74%, 95% CI: 0.38–1.10%); the prevalence was the highest in the south region and lowest in the east region (4.46% and 1.23%, respectively). The results of logistic regression analyses showed that age, urolithiasis, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, thiazide drugs intake, family history of diabetes and hypertension were all significantly associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (OR&gt;1). In addition, education, vitamin D intake and family history of urolithiasis are all protective factors (OR&amp;lt;1). Our results indicate that there was a high prevalence of MS in Chinese adults. Compared to the previous study 10 years ago, some preventive strategies have worked; however, further work on the prevention and treatment of MS remains necessary.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in China: An up-dated cross-sectional study</title><fingerprint>b664fda7</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Lan, Zanlin Mai, Shiyu Zhou, Yang Liu, Shujue Li, Zhijian Zhao, Xiaolu Duan, Cao Cai, Tuo Deng, Wei Zhu, Wenqi Wu, Guohua Zeng&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Unstable conditions of the craniocervical junction such as atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) or atlanto-axial instability (AAI) are severe injuries with a high risk of tetraplegia or death. Immobilization by a cervical collar to protect the patient from secondary damage is a standard procedure in trauma patients. If the application of a cervical collar to a patient with an unstable craniocervical condition may cause segmental motion and secondary injury to the spinal cord is unknown.The aim of the current study is (i) to analyze compression on the dural sac and (ii) to determine relative motion of the cervical spine during the procedure of applying a cervical collar in case of ligamentous unstable craniocervical junction.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Ligamentous AOD as well as AOD combined with ligamentous AAI was simulated in two newly developed cadaveric trauma models. Compression of the dural sac and segmental angulation in the upper cervical spine were measured on video fluoroscopy after myelography during the application of a cervical collar. Furthermore, overall three-dimensional motion of the cervical spine was measured by a motion tracking system.In six cadavers each, the two new trauma models on AOD and AOD combined with AAI could be implemented. Mean dural sac compression was significantly increased to -1.1 mm (-1.3 to -0.7 mm) in case of AOD and -1.2 mm (-1.6 to -0.6 mm) in the combined model of AOD and AAI. Furthermore, there is a significant increased angulation at the C0/C1 level in the AOD model. Immense three-dimensional movement up to 22.9° of cervical spine flexion was documented during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The current study pointed out that applying a cervical collar in general will cause immense three-dimensional movement. In case of unstable craniocervical junction, this leads to a dural sac compression and thus to possible damage to the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195215</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195215</link><published>1523048400000</published><title>Motion and dural sac compression in the upper cervical spine during the application of a cervical collar in case of unstable craniocervical junction—A study in two new cadaveric trauma models</title><fingerprint>4ad99bdb</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shiyao Liao, Niko R.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to assess the association between perceived social support and induced abortion among young women in Lima, Peru. In addition, prevalence and incidence of induced abortion was estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study enrolling women aged 18–25 years from maternal health centers in Southern Lima, Peru, was conducted. Induced abortion was defined as the difference between the total number of pregnancies ended in abortion and the number of spontaneous abortions; whereas perceived social support was assessed using the DUKE-UNC scale. Prevalence and incidence of induced abortion (per 100 person-years risk) was estimated, and the association of interest was evaluated using Poisson regression models with robust variance. A total of 298 women were enrolled, mean age 21.7 (± 2.2) years. Low levels of social support were found in 43.6% (95%CI 38.0%–49.3%), and 17.4% (95%CI: 13.1%– 21.8%) women reported at least one induced abortion. The incidence of induced abortion was 2.37 (95%CI: 1.81–3.11) per 100 person-years risk. The multivariable model showed evidence of the association between low perceived social support and induced abortion (RR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.14–3.30) after controlling for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was evidence of an association between low perceived social support and induced abortion among women aged 18 to 25 years. Incidence of induced abortion was similar or even greater than rates of countries where abortion is legal. Strategies to increase social support and reduce induced abortion rates are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192764</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0192764</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Association between perceived social support and induced abortion: A study in maternal health centers in Lima, Peru</title><fingerprint>1c859bfd</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Luis E.

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to administer a Delphi panel survey and provide evidence for the development of a psychological intervention protocol for use after disasters in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A three-round Delphi survey was conducted. In all rounds, respondents answered open- or closed-ended questions regarding their views on i) the concept of disaster, ii) evaluation, iii) intervention, and iv) considerations in a disaster. Data from Round 1 were subjected to content analysis. In Round 2, items with content validity ratios (CVRs) greater than 0.49 were included, and in Round 3, items with a CVR≥0.38 were accepted.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The response rates for the Delphi survey were high: 83% (n = 15, Round 1), 80% (n = 16, Round 2), and 86% (n = 24, Round 3). The data collected during this survey showed a need for a support system for children; for preventive strategies, including disaster readiness plans; for the protection of children&apos;s safety; and for the development of post-disaster psychosocial care.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The panel experts reached a consensus regarding the steps they considered critical in post-disaster evaluation and intervention.

The &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquito is the principal vector of arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus. These arboviruses are transmitted during adult female mosquito bloodfeeding. While these viruses must transverse the midgut to replicate, the blood meal must also reach the midgut to be digested, absorbed, or excreted, as aggregation of blood meal metabolites can be toxic to the female mosquito midgut. The midgut peritrophic matrix (PM), a semipermeable extracellular layer comprised of chitin fibrils, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, is one such mechanism of protection for the mosquito midgut. However, this structure has not been characterized for adult female &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. We conducted a mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis to identify proteins that comprise or are associated with the adult female &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; early midgut PM. Altogether, 474 unique proteins were identified, with 115 predicted as secreted. GO-term enrichment analysis revealed an abundance of serine-type proteases and several known and novel intestinal mucins. In addition, approximately 10% of the peptides identified corresponded to known salivary proteins, indicating &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes extensively swallow their own salivary secretions. However, the physiological relevance of this remains unclear, and further studies are needed to determine PM proteins integral for midgut protection from blood meal derived toxicity and pathogen protection.

Background &lt;p&gt;Five billion people lack access to safe, affordable, and timely surgical and anesthesia care. Significant challenges remain in the provision of surgical care in low-resource settings. Uganda is no exception.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From September to November 2016, we conducted a mixed-methods countrywide surgical capacity assessment at 17 randomly selected public hospitals in Uganda. Researchers conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders to understand factors related to the provision of surgical care. The framework approach was used for thematic and explanatory data analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The Ugandan public health care sector continues to face significant challenges in the provision of safe, timely, and affordable surgical care. These challenges can be broadly grouped into preparedness and policy, service delivery, and the financial burden of surgical care. Hospital staff reported challenges including: (1) significant delays in accessing surgical care, compounded by a malfunctioning referral system; (2) critical workforce shortages; (3) operative capacity that is limited by inadequate infrastructure and overwhelmed by emergency and obstetric volume; (4) supply chain difficulties pertaining to provision of essential medications, equipment, supplies, and blood; (5) significant, variable, and sometimes catastrophic expenditures for surgical patients and their families; and (6) a lack of surgery-specific policies and priorities. Despite these challenges, innovative strategies are being used in the public to provide surgical care to those most in need.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Barriers to the provision of surgical care are cross-cutting and involve constraints in infrastructure, service delivery, workforce, and financing.

Background &amp;amp; aims &lt;p&gt;To determine the prognostic potential of classic and novel serologic antibodies regarding unfavorable disease course in a prospective ulcerative colitis (UC) patient cohort, since few and conflicting data are available in the literature regarding this matter.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;187 consecutive patients were studied prospectively (median follow-up: 135 months) from a single referral IBD center in Hungary. Sera were tested for different IgA/IgG type autoantibodies (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic [ANCA], anti-DNA-bound-lactoferrin [anti-LFS], anti-goblet cell [anti-GAB] and anti-pancreatic [PAB: anti-CUZD1 and anti-GP2)]) by indirect immunofluorescence technique and for anti-microbial (anti-&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; [ASCA] IgG/IgA and anti-OMP Plus&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; IgA) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 73.6%, 62.4% and 11.2% of UC patients were positive for IgA/IgG type of atypical perinuclear-ANCA, anti-LFS and anti-GAB, respectively. Occurrences of PABs were 9.6%, while ASCA IgA/IgG and anti-OMP IgA were 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Antibody status was stable over time. IgA type PABs were more prevalent in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (37.5% vs. 4.7% for anti-CUZD1 and 12.5% vs. 0% for anti-GP2, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt; for both). IgA type ASCA and anti-CUZD1 antibodies were associated with higher risk of requirement for long-term immunosuppressant therapy in Kaplan-Meier analysis (pLogRank &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt; for both). However, in multivariate Cox-regression analysis only ASCA IgA (HR: 2.74, 95%CI: 1.46–5.14, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;) remained independent predictor. UC-related hospitalization due to disease activity was only associated with multiple antibody positivity (for 3 or more; HR 2.03 [95% CI: 1.16–3.56]; p = 0.013). None of the individual antibodies or their combination was associated with the risk of development of extensive disease or colectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Even with low prevalence rates, present study gives further evidence to the role of certain antibodies as markers for distinct phenotype and disease outcome in UC. Considering the result of the multivariate analysis the novel antibodies investigated do not seem to be associated with poor clinical outcome in UC, only a classic antibody, IgA subtype ASCA remained an independent predictor of long-term immunosuppressive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194166</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194166</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Significance of serological markers in the disease course of ulcerative colitis in a prospective clinical cohort of patients</title><fingerprint>2c0b14f3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gyorgy Kovacs, Nora Sipeki, Boglarka Suga, Tamas Tornai, Kai Fechner, Gary L.

However, in multivariate Cox-regression analysis only ASCA IgA (HR: 2.74, 95%CI: 1.46–5.14, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;) remained independent predictor. UC-related hospitalization due to disease activity was only associated with multiple antibody positivity (for 3 or more; HR 2.03 [95% CI: 1.16–3.56]; p = 0.013). None of the individual antibodies or their combination was associated with the risk of development of extensive disease or colectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Even with low prevalence rates, present study gives further evidence to the role of certain antibodies as markers for distinct phenotype and disease outcome in UC. Considering the result of the multivariate analysis the novel antibodies investigated do not seem to be associated with poor clinical outcome in UC, only a classic antibody, IgA subtype ASCA remained an independent predictor of long-term immunosuppressive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194166</canonicalUrl><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2814:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256859v2?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Appuswamy, R.</name></author><description>Rapid advances in sequencing technologies are producing genomic data on an unprecedented scale.

Neurons require a nearly constant supply of ATP. Glucose is the predominant source of brain ATP, but the direct effects of prolonged glucose deprivation on neuronal viability and function remain unclear. In sparse rat hippocampal microcultures, neurons were surprisingly resilient to 16 h glucose removal in the absence of secondary excitotoxicity. Neuronal survival and synaptic transmission were unaffected by prolonged removal of exogenous glucose. Inhibition of lactate transport decreased microculture neuronal survival during concurrent glucose deprivation, suggesting that endogenously released lactate is important for tolerance to glucose deprivation. Tandem depolarization and glucose deprivation also reduced neuronal survival, and trace glucose concentrations afforded neuroprotection. Mass cultures, in contrast to microcultures, were insensitive to depolarizing glucose deprivation, a difference attributable to increased extracellular lactate levels. Removal of local astrocyte support did not reduce survival in response to glucose deprivation or alter evoked excitatory transmission, suggesting that on-demand, local lactate shuttling is not necessary for neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose removal. Taken together, these data suggest that endogenously produced lactate available globally in the extracellular milieu sustains neurons in the absence of glucose. A better understanding of resilience mechanisms in reduced preparations could lead to therapeutic strategies aimed to bolster these mechanisms in vulnerable neuronal populations.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195520</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195520</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>Ambient but not local lactate underlies neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose deprivation</title><fingerprint>7698fc0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Courtney Sobieski, Natasha Warikoo, Hong-Jin Shu, Steven Mennerick&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury still represents a major concern in clinical transplantation, especially in the era of extreme organ shortage and extended criteria donor organs. In the present study we aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Lewis rats were used (n = 144 / 72 OLT cases; 240–340g) as donors and recipients. Livers were flushed and stored in 4°C HTK-solution for 8h before implantation. Recipients were randomly allocated into three experimental groups: RIC 1, RIC 2, Control. In RIC 1, RIC 2 groups, RIC was applied in the recipient before hepatectomy or after reperfusion (4x5-5min IR via clamping the infrarenal aorta), respectively. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 24, 168h post-reperfusion (n = 6 recipient/group/time point). Hepatocellular injury, graft circulation, serum cytokines, tissue redox-stress and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels have been assessed. Additional markers were analyzed, using Western blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;RIC 1 group showed significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) improved portal venous and microcirculation flow as well as velocity. RIC has significantly reduced tissue injury according to the serum levels of transaminases and results of histopathological evaluation. Reduced TUNEL-staining (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1–2 vs. Control) and elevated pBAD/BAD ratio was detected in the RIC groups (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1 vs. Control). Supporting findings were obtained from measurements of serum IL-10 as well as tissue malondialdehyde and ATP levels. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA-expression was significantly higher in RIC 1 compared to Control (p&amp;lt;0.05 RIC 1 vs. Control).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that RIC might confer potent protection against the detrimental effects of IR injury including tissue damage, apoptosis, graft circulation, inflammation, tissue energetic status in OLT. HO-1 overexpression might play an orchestrating role in RIC mediated organ protection. An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>Limb remote ischemic conditioning of the recipient protects the liver in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation</title><fingerprint>968614f6</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zoltan Czigany, Christian Bleilevens, Christian Beckers, Christian Stoppe, Michaela Möhring, Andras Fülöp, Attila Szijarto, Georg Lurje, Ulf P.

An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</canonicalUrl><updated>1522875600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ec7:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00106</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Yilin Song, Jinping Wang, Li Liu, Qi Sun, Qing You, Yu Cheng, Yidan Wang, Siyu Wang, Fengping Tan, Nan Li</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00106/20180409/images/medium/mp-2018-00106z_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00106&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

But change in this area is a hard thing to bring about. &lt;em&gt;Biocentury&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biocentury.com/biocentury/regulation/2018-04-12/why-john-ioannidis-says-norm-p-values-should-shift-0005&quot;&gt;a good interview&lt;/a&gt; with someone who can tell you about that, John Ioannidis, of scientific reproducibility fame. He’s recently set off a lot of comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2676503?redirect=true&quot;&gt;with a proposal&lt;/a&gt; to lower the threshold for “significance” to p &amp;lt; 0.005, and as you’d imagine, there are some strong opinions on that. His estimate is that this would shift about a third of the published biomedical results to “suggestive” rather than significant, and his take on this is, basically “good riddance”. According to Ioannidis, a lot of those are false positives anyway, and a lot of the ones that are real are not really useful. Here’s the root of the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: What is the correct way to think about a p-value?&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: A p-value is the probability or the chance that you’ll see a result that is so extreme as the one that you see if the null hypothesis is true and if there is no bias. Many people say a p-value is the chance of the null hypothesis being wrong, of some effect being there. This completely ignores the fact that you have these two ‘ifs’ that are required to interpret the p-value. So it is the chance of seeing such an extreme result, or something even more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true and if we have no bias.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he’s upfront about the fact that his suggested new threshold is not the final answer, but just an interim step towards larger reforms. He wants to see better experimental and trial designs (Bayesian and traditional), larger sample sizes, and more attention paid to potential sources of bias and to effect size. In fact, if people just go wild for the new, stricter p-values, it’ll be a loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: Don’t you have a concern that by moving to a smaller p-value you are reinforcing the fetish about p-values and driving people to create enormous data sets? With data sets that are big enough, you can get very small p-values, but that doesn’t mean the results mean anything.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: Absolutely. And this is why 80% of the literature should not be using p-values, maybe 90% of the literature. With huge amounts of data, with big data, using a p-value means nothing, because everything can be statistically significant at 0.05 or even at 0.005. &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the question is, how do you change the mentality of people who are kind of automatically hooked to using a single magic number? It’s not that the alternative approaches that are better, like using effect size and confidence intervals or using Bayesian statistics, are recent. They have been out there for a long time, but their adoption, even though it is accelerating, has not been what we want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, he thinks that p-value is the right tool for the job about 20% of the time, whereas Bayesian measures could be useful half the time, maybe even more. One instant objection to the idea of lowering p-value cutoffs is that it will make everything much more expensive and time-consuming (clinical trials, first and foremost), but his contention is that it doesn’t have to be that way. Better designs and more appropriate measures could cancel a lot of the brute-force bigger-sample stuff – and you get the impression that he’s deliberately pushing people towards those by making it too expensive to do it the old way. “We have some very strong tools that we don’t apply”, says Ioannidis, and he’s going to try to make people apply them, one way or another. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Clinical Trials</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162ce5485f1:29ae598:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523880068593</crawled><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>0.08</engagementRate><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/16/tighten-up-your-numbers</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289710v1?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Dai, J.</name></author><description>Motivation: Analyzing tandem mass spectrometry data to recognize peptides in a sample is the fundamental task in computational proteomics. Traditional peptide identification algorithms perform well when identifying unmodified peptides. However, when peptides have post-translational modifications (PTMs), these methods cannot provide satisfactory results. Recently, Chick et al., 2015 and Yu et al., 2016 proposed the spectrum-based and tag-based open search methods, respectively, to identify peptides with PTMs. While the performance of these two methods is promising, the identification results vary greatly with respect to the quality of tandem mass spectra and the number of PTMs in peptides.

Background &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to conduct an indirect treatment comparison between cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel relative to comparators in the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who progress on docetaxel-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the network meta-analysis of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Due to a lack of head-to-head trials, studies with a comparator arm of best supportive care were included in the analysis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events were compared within both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks. The ratios for survival outcomes were estimated using hazard ratios (HR), and the ratios for adverse events between groups were estimated using odds ratios (ORs); uncertainty was reported as 95% confidence (Frequentist) and credible (Baysesian) Intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three of thirteen trials identified for abstraction were relevant for analyses. Median overall survival was not statistically significantly different for abiraterone (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.83–1.28) or enzalutamide (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.69–1.11) when compared to cabazitaxel in the Bayesian analysis. Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01–10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI = 1.41–75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03–10.09) were more likely to occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14–206.40). Frequentist analyses produced similar results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The scarcity of clinical studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles. As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the beneficial effects of these therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195790</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195790</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Indirect treatment comparison of cabazitaxel for patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have been previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen</title><fingerprint>1d131747</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jon P.

As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the beneficial effects of these therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195790</canonicalUrl><updated>1523480400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d6:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23659-x</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Fredrik Berglind</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23659-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23659-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/5l5B07YBkHY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23659-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>14</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/5l5B07YBkHY/s41598-018-23659-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23659-x</link><published>1522825200000</published><title>Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures</title><fingerprint>24f25669</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23659-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23659-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/5l5B07YBkHY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1628ff11fa6:9a1198a:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23659-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23659_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>683</width><height>685</height></visual><crawled>1522833366950</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3388.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Salvatore Rizza, Simone Cardaci, Costanza Montagna, Giuseppina Di Giacomo, Daniela De Zio, Matteo Bordi, Emiliano Maiani, Silvia Campello, Antonella Borreca, Annibale A.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To analyze the correlation between structural characteristics of intraorbital optic nerve (ION) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) measured by 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI), and the severity of glaucomatous damage.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional study, 41 glaucoma patients and 12 age- and sex-matched controls underwent standard automated perimetry (SAP) and frequency doubling technology (FDT) as functional evaluation; optic disc stereophotograph, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal scanning laser tomography as ocular structural evaluation; and 3T MRI. Structure-structure and structure-function correlation were performed using bootstrap resampling method for clustered data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The ION mean diameter and cross-sectional area were different between glaucoma and control groups at 5mm and 10mm (all, p≤0.011) from the globe, but not at 15mm (both, p≥0.067). LGN height was significantly lower in glaucoma group (p = 0.005). OCT rim area and functional parameters (SAP and FDT) correlated significantly with all ION segments, showing stronger correlations at 10 and 15 mm. ION parameters at 10 and 15 mm presented mild-to-moderate correlation with OCT peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness, and ION at 15mm had mild association with the neuroretinal rim area on stereophotographs. Although LGN height was significantly smaller in glaucoma group (p = 0.005), LGN parameters were not associated with any ocular structural or functional parameter.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Assessment of central and peripheral nervous systems using 3T MRI confirmed that glaucoma patients had smaller ION dimensions and LGN height compared to the control group. In general, ION dimensions presented mild to moderate correlations with functional and ocular structural parameters. Although ION had significant correlations at any distance from the eye, the ION distal locations correlated better with OCT results and functional parameters.

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522789200000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1628c98f9e7:4903d:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Javier A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Governments have an ethical imperative to safeguard children in residential care institutions at all times, including in the aftermath of an emergency. Yet, a lack of accurate data about how the magnitude and characteristics of this population may change due to an emergency impedes leaders’ ability to formulate responsive policies and services, mobilize resources and foster accountability. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the feasibility of evaluating movement of children into residential care following an emergency.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The pilot study took place in Les Cayes commune in the Sud Department of Haiti in April 2017. Six months prior to the pilot, the area was severely affected by Hurricane Matthew, with widespread devastation to property, livestock and livelihoods. Using a two-stage process, the team created a comprehensive list of residential care institutions in Les Cayes. At each facility, the data collectors attempted to administer four separate tools: a group count tool, a record review tool, interviews with staff, and interviews with children 10 years of age and older.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 27 known institutions in Les Cayes, 22 institutions consented to participate in the research. Within these 22 institutions, the prevalence of new arrivals to residential care since Hurricane Matthew varied significantly across the four tools, ranging from 0.69% according to the aggregated child interviews to 20.96% according to the aggregated staff interviews. Record availability and quality was very poor and child participation was difficult to arrange due to travel and scheduling constraints.&lt;/p&gt; Interpretation &lt;p&gt;Robust measurement of new arrivals to residential care institutions was not feasible in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew. Moreover, many of the challenges encountered are likely to be encountered in humanitarian emergencies in other settings. Therefore, the research team does not recommend scale-up of these methods in most humanitarian settings. Alternative approaches that incorporate household survey methods to ascertain movement into residential care based on reports from caregivers may be more realistic in places with poor pre-existing governance systems and weak registries and records for residential care institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195515</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195515</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>Measuring movement into residential care institutions in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew: A pilot study</title><fingerprint>87374801</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Beth L.

Vibrations are important cues for tactile perception across species. Whisker-based sensation in mice is a powerful model system for investigating mechanisms of tactile perception. However, the role vibration plays in whisker-based sensation remains unsettled, in part due to difficulties in modeling the vibration of whiskers. Here, we develop an analytical approach to calculate the vibrations of whiskers striking objects. We use this approach to quantify vibration forces during active whisker touch at a range of locations along the whisker. The frequency and amplitude of vibrations evoked by contact are strongly dependent on the position of contact along the whisker. The magnitude of vibrational shear force and bending moment is comparable to quasi-static forces. The fundamental vibration frequencies are in a detectable range for mechanoreceptor properties and below the maximum spike rates of primary sensory afferents. These results suggest two dynamic cues exist that rodents can use for object localization: vibration frequency and comparison of vibrational to quasi-static force magnitude. These complement the use of quasi-static force angle as a distance cue, particularly for touches close to the follicle, where whiskers are stiff and force angles hardly change during touch. Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oRjfKRlw_io&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522184400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162688e2a3c:4d823:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Vaxenburg, Isis Wyche, Karel Svoboda, Alexander L.

In Europe, responsible research and innovation (RRI) has emerged as a science policy measure that demands the early integration of a broad range of social actors and perspectives into research and development (R&amp;amp;D). More collaboration of the social sciences and humanities (SSH) with science and engineering appears within this policy framework as a crucial element that will enable better technological development. However, RRI is new to both natural scientists and SSH scholars, and interdisciplinary collaborations are challenging for many reasons. In this paper, we discuss these challenges while suggesting that what RRI can be in a particular project is not a given but remains an empirical question. Natural scientists and SSH scholars need to coresearch RRI in an experimental mode.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cWfW7Xi3ric&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522098000000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162637274c8:13dfc4:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Delgado, Heidrun Åm&lt;/p&gt;

Moreover, multiple channels or conductance levels can be present at a time in the data that need to be quantified to accurately understand the behavior of the system. Manual procedures for removing these fluctuations and extracting conducting states or multiple channels are laborious, prone to subjective bias, and hinder the processing of often very large data-sets. We introduce a maximum likelihood formalism for separating signal from a noisy and drifting background such as fluorescence traces from imaging of elementary Ca2+ release events called puffs arising from clusters of channels and patch-clamp recordings of ion channels. Parameters such as the number of open channels or conducting states, noise level, and background signal can all be optimized using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We implement our algorithm following the Baum-Welch approach to EM in the portable java language with a user-friendly graphical interface and test the algorithm on both synthetic and experimental data from patch-clamp electrophysiology of Ca2+ channels and fluorescence microscopy of a cluster of Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ channels with multiple conductance levels. The resulting software is accurate, fast, and provides detailed information usually not available through manual analysis. Options for visual inspection of the raw and processed data with key parameters, and exporting a range of statistics such as the mean open probabilities, mean open times, mean close times, and dwell time distributions for different number of channels open or conductance levels, amplitude distribution of all opening events, and number of transitions between different number of open channels or conducting levels in asci format with a single click are provided.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299875v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299875v1?rss=1</link><published>1523430000000</published><title>TraceSpecks: a software for automated idealization of noisy patch-clamp and imaging data [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>cc0f3130</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Experimental records of single molecules or ion channels from fluorescence microscopy and patch-clamp electrophysiology often include high-frequency noise and baseline fluctuations that are not generated by the system under investigation and have to be removed.

Climate change has been identified as the primary threat to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems in this century, although there is still much uncertainty about its effects and the degree of vulnerability for different ecosystems to this threat. Here we propose a new methodological approach capable of measuring and mapping the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems at large scales based on their climatic niche. To do this, we used high spatial resolution remote sensing data and ecological niche modeling techniques to calculate and spatialize the resilience of three stable states of ecosystems in South America: forest, savanna, and grassland. Also, we evaluated the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate stress, the likelihood of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions, and their respective adaptive capacities in the face of climate change. Our results indicate that forests, the most productive and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on the earth, are more vulnerable to climate change than savannas or grasslands. Forests showed less resistance to climate stress and a higher chance of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions. If this scenario occurs, the forest ecosystems would have less chance of adaptation compared to savannas or grasslands because of their narrow climate niche. Therefore, we can conclude that a possible consolidation of non-analogous climatic conditions would lead to a loss of resilience in the forest ecosystem, significantly increasing the chance of a critical transition event to another stable state with a lower density of vegetation cover (e.g., savanna or grassland).</description><engagement>45</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194654</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194654</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Measuring resilience and assessing vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change in South America</title><fingerprint>7b32af6e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Luciano J.

L-carnitine is important for the catabolism of long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria. We investigated how the triacylglycerol (TAG)-lowering drug 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) influenced lipid metabolism in carnitine-depleted, 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium)propionate dehydrate (Mildronate; meldonium)-treated male Wistar rats. As indicated, carnitine biosynthesis was impaired by Mildronate. However, TAG levels of both plasma and liver were decreased by 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated animals. This was accompanied by increased gene expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial activity and proliferation and reduced mRNA levels of &lt;i&gt;Dgat2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ApoB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ApoCIII&lt;/i&gt; in liver. The hepatic energy state was reduced in the group of Mildronate and 1-triple TTA as reflected by increased AMP/ATP ratio, reduced energy charge and induced gene expression of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3. The increase in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation was observed despite low plasma carnitine levels, and was linked to strongly induced gene expression of carnitine acetyltransferase, translocase and carnitine transporter, suggesting an efficient carnitine turnover. The present data suggest that the plasma TAG-lowering effect of 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated rats is not only due to increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation reflected by increased mitochondrial biogenesis, but also to changes in plasma clearance and reduced TAG biosynthesis.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194978</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194978</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>A fatty acid analogue targeting mitochondria exerts a plasma triacylglycerol lowering effect in rats with impaired carnitine biosynthesis</title><fingerprint>e96e7acc</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Carine Lindquist, Bodil Bjørndal, Christine Renate Rossmann, Asbjørn Svardal, Seth Hallström, Rolf Kristian Berge&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;In parturients with increased physiologically intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and a short stature, a greater cephalad spread of spinal anesthesia is often observed after a fixed amount of plain bupivacaine is administered. Therefore, we designed this prospective study to test whether IAP and vertebral column length (VCL) were predictors of spinal spread in parturients undergoing a cesarean section.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 113 parturients, all undergoing elective cesarean sections with single-shot spinal anesthesia, were enrolled. The L3-L4 interspace was entered, and 2 mL of 0.5% plain bupivacaine was injected into the subarachnoid space. Upon loss of temperature sensation at the T4 level, IAP was measured through a bladder catheter while the patient was in the supine position with a 10°left lateral tilt. Parturient demographic variables, including age, height, weight, IAP, and VCL were recorded. Linear regressions and multiple regressions were performed to analyze the relationships between parturient variables and the spread of spinal anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 109 parturients were included in the analysis. Linear regression analysis showed a significant univariate correlation of height, weight, body mass index (BMI), IAP, and VCL with cephalad spread (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt; 0.004). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that IAP and VCL were the key determinants of spinal spread (both &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), where as exclusion of age, weight, and height did not change the result (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt; 0.209).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our data indicated that IAP and VCL were significant predictors of intrathecal spread of plain bupivacaine, and there was a positive association between IAP and abdominal girth in term parturients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195137</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195137</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>Intra-abdominal pressure, vertebral column length, and spread of spinal anesthesia in parturients undergoing cesarean section: An observational study</title><fingerprint>e2e14759</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ting-ting Ni, Ying Zhou, An-cui Yong, Lu Wang, Qing-he Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple linear regression analysis showed that IAP and VCL were the key determinants of spinal spread (both &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), where as exclusion of age, weight, and height did not change the result (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt; 0.209).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our data indicated that IAP and VCL were significant predictors of intrathecal spread of plain bupivacaine, and there was a positive association between IAP and abdominal girth in term parturients.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195137</canonicalUrl><updated>1522789200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5a:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03920-z</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><author><name>Douwe Draaisma</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From meat to mind: the root of consciousness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From meat to mind: the root of consciousness, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03920-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03920-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Douwe Draaisma enjoys Michael Gazzaniga’s exploration of the biological basis of consciousness.</description><engagement>114</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03920-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03920-z</link><published>1522825200000</published><title>From meat to mind: the root of consciousness</title><fingerprint>7b7f5699</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From meat to mind: the root of consciousness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From meat to mind: the root of consciousness, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03920-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03920-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Douwe Draaisma enjoys Michael Gazzaniga’s exploration of the biological basis of consciousness.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162901f97dc:9be8859:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03920-z/d41586-018-03920-z_15570306.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1522836412380</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288274v2?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><author><name>Hoyt, C.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, HSPGs, modulate major transformations of cancer cells, leading to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. HSPGs also regulate neo-angiogenesis which prompts cancer progression and metastatic spread. A different aspect of heparin and analogs is their prominent role in the coagulation of blood. The interplay between coagulation and metastasis is being actively studied: anticoagulants such as heparin-derivatives have anticancer activity and procoagulants, such as thrombin, positively modulate proliferation, migration and invasion. The branched peptide NT4 binds to HSPGs and targets selectively cancer cells and tissues. For this, it had been extensively investigated in the last years and it proved to be efficient as chemotherapeutic and tumor tracer in &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; models of cancer. We investigated the effects of the branched peptide in terms of modulation of angiogenesis and invasiveness of cancer cells. NT4 proved to have a major impact on endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation, particularly when induced by FGF2 and thrombin.

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls. Furthermore, higher proportions of viral sequences from northern pintails (&lt;i&gt;Anas acuta&lt;/i&gt;), emperor geese and glaucous-winged gulls were grouped in phylogenetic clades that included IAV sequences originating from wild birds sampled in Asia as compared to non-pintail dabbling ducks, a difference that may be related to intercontinental migratory tendencies of host species. Our summary of research and surveillance efforts at Izembek NWR will assist in future prioritization of which hosts to sample and swab types to collect in Alaska and elsewhere in order to maximize isolate recovery, subtype and sequence diversity for resultant viruses, and detection of evidence for intercontinental viral exchange.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195327</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195327</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Influenza A virus recovery, diversity, and intercontinental exchange: A multi-year assessment of wild bird sampling at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska</title><fingerprint>9f25fe34</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew B.

Two recent papers do exactly that, and I’m going to propose combining them for even more instrumental craziness. The first covers a class of cellular structure that I had no idea even existed, even though it’s been studied for many years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC372955/&quot;&gt;bacterial gas vesicles&lt;/a&gt;. There are species of aquatic bacteria (and Archaea) that produce hollow protein structures (some 200 nM long) whose walls are so hydrophobic that they exclude water and are too tight to let larger hydrophobic compounds in. What does that leave them to be filled with? Gases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria produce these to regulate their density and maintain buoyancy; they’re basically nanoscale swim bladders. But as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593117301898&quot;&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt; shows, there are people taking advantage of these structures for imaging. The contrast between the gas phase and the cytosol makes these structures available for ultrasound detection, and I have to salute the first person to whom that unusual thought occurred. Micron-scale bubbles (stabilized by lipid or protein) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818980/&quot;&gt;are used as&lt;/a&gt; an ultrasound contrast agent, so it makes sense, and in 2014 a Berkeley/Toronto team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4023545/&quot;&gt;showed that&lt;/a&gt; it works quite well. In fact, different sorts of vesicles from different species can be distinguished by their ultrasound behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could get cells to produce such things for you on demand, you’d have a shot at an ultrasound reporter gene construct (of all things). It’s not easy. The gas vesicles actually need several genes to produce the mix of proteins in their walls, and getting everything to express and assemble properly seems to have taken some experimentation, but a report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25021&quot;&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; shows that conventional disease bacteria can be made to express them and they can be detected in turn to localize the organisms &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these vesicles can also be exploited for another detection method: NMR. Air-filled regions have high contrast in T2 magnetic resonance imaging, and with sufficient resolution, you could pick up these gas vesicles as well. The review paper mentions another possibility – allowing these to fill with hyperpolarized xenon – that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1934&quot;&gt;also been realized&lt;/a&gt; by the same group (now at CalTech). This gives &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490238/&quot;&gt;huge gains&lt;/a&gt; in sensitivity, as hyperpolarized species do (normally only a tiny fraction of the potential atoms can be observed in a regular NMR experiment; this makes everything signal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentioning NMR, though, brings me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25781&quot;&gt;another recent paper&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/02/04/singlecell_nmr_how_about_singleprotein_nmr&quot;&gt;a while back&lt;/a&gt; about an exotic NMR possibility, using spin-defect diamond crystals as detectors, that could possibly lead to NMR detection in very small volumes (such as a single cell or even smaller). Here’s a paper from a Harvard/MIT collaboration that’s taking this much closer to reality. The problem with using a single spin defect center is that while you can detect NMR signals in a very small volume, the resolution is poor (100 Hz or so under the best conditions). NMR-using chemists will recognize that as very fuzzy indeed – you can get vastly better spectral resolution on a 1970s electromagnet NMR, although you’re not going to be picking up any single-cell-volume signals with it, to be fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new paper uses several of these unpaired-electron defects in an array, along with a much fancier overall method (coherently averaged synchronized readout, CASR, which I do not understand this morning well enough to describe). What is immediately apparent, though, is that they’re getting real NMR spectra of small test molecules (ethyl formate, xylene, glycerol, trimethyl phosphate) in picoliter-sized volumes of sample. There are many more refinements that are possible to the technique, and the authors seems hopeful (well, as authors generally are, admittedly) that the method will indeed be able to realize single-cell NMR experiments, multiplexed experiments across parallel detectors for bulk samples, and other completely new fields of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d think that these two techniques would work very well together –  the extreme spatial resolution of the diamond-defect detectors with the gas vesicles inside single cells. (I haven’t even mentioned another NMR possibility that’s explored in that review article I started with, the idea of using aquaporins as NMR reporters). If we really do get down to that kind of resolution, all sorts of other exotic ideas will surely swim into view. This gets to &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6113/1426.summary&quot;&gt;Freeman Dyson’s point&lt;/a&gt; about “tool-driven revolutions” &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/chemistry-galisonian-rather-than-kuhnian/&quot;&gt;rather than&lt;/a&gt; concept-driven ones. Build a new instrument, that does new things and gives you new ways of looking at the world, and new concepts will follow. Let’s see if it works here!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Analytical Chemistry</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_16248d1c968:368cc00:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521640130920</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/21/13348</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/106922v2?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Oertlin, C.</name></author><description>Genome-wide analysis of mRNA translation (translatomics) can improve understanding of biological processes and pathological conditions including cancer.

Moreover, DBS induced expression of 17-24% of the genes downregulated in other intellectual disability mouse models and in post-mortem human brain tissue from patients with Major Depressive Disorder, suggesting forniceal DBS could benefit individuals with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34031</link><published>1521763200000</published><title>Forniceal deep brain stimulation induces gene expression and splicing changes that promote neurogenesis and plasticity</title><fingerprint>5054e4c0</fingerprint><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16252f25966:477479c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521810037094</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34031</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3482.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Samir Haj-Dahmane, Roh-Yu Shen, Matthew W.

Background &lt;p&gt;The ageing population and the expected increase in the number of elderly patients make an evidence-based assessment of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in old patients progressively more important. Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO results for patient aged &amp;lt;65 years is well known. However, the risk profile and in-hospital prognosis of advanced age patients with ECMO still need more investigation. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predicted the outcomes for elderly patients who received VA-ECMO.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this retrospective study, medical records for patients with ECMO aged 65 years and over were collected between 2009 and 2012 at a tertiary hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 99 patients (mean age: 76.4±6.4 years) were included. The most common condition requiring VA-ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. Among survivors on VA-ECMO, 28 (28.3%) patients were successfully weaned from support. Thirteen (13.1%) patients were successfully discharged. We found that cardiogenic shock (OR = 3.158, P = 0.013), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR = 1.147, P&amp;lt;0.001), and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) score (OR = 1.054, P = 0.001) were risk factors associated with survival on VA-ECMO. By using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, the APACHE II score and SAPS II score displayed acceptable discriminative power (AUC 0.722; 0.715, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the risk of mortality increases with cardiogenic shock, higher APACHE II score, and higher SAPS II score.

These risk factors can be utilized as potential predictors to identify the potential candidates for ECMO support.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195445</canonicalUrl><updated>1523048400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd07a:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Hamid Bolouri</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/rHJ2uFaIUnU/nm0418-526b</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b</link><published>1523343600000</published><title>Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions</title><fingerprint>295b60f4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm0418-526b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/rHJ2uFaIUnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_162b039947a:1dcc85e:923c4a60</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm0418-526b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/rHJ2uFaIUnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523374986362</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/111?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;The Eneolithic Botai culture of the Central Asian steppes provides the earliest archaeological evidence for horse husbandry, ~5500 years ago, but the exact nature of early horse domestication remains controversial.

With roots in techniques from computational topology, and using a shared‐memory parallel approach, TopoMS provides scalable, numerically robust, and topologically consistent analysis. TopoMS can be used as a command‐line tool or with a GUI (graphical user interface), where the latter also enables an interactive exploration of the molecular graph. This paper presents algorithmic details of TopoMS and compares it with state‐of‐the‐art tools: Bader charge analysis v1.0 (Arnaldsson et al., 01/11/17) and molecular graph extraction using Critic2 (Otero‐de‐la‐Roza et al., Comput. Phys. Commun. 2014, 185, 1007). TopoMS not only combines the functionality of these individual codes but also demonstrates up to 4× performance gain on a standard laptop, faster convergence to fine‐grid solution, robustness against lattice bias, and topological consistency. TopoMS is released publicly under BSD License. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25181?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>We introduce TopoMS, a computational tool enabling detailed topological analysis of molecular and condensed‐matter systems, including the computation of atomic volumes and charges through the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, as well as the complete molecular graph.

Antennal sensory units in nymphs and adults of the spotted Lanternfly, &lt;i&gt;Lycorma delicatula&lt;/i&gt; (White) (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha: Fulgoridae), an economically important plant pest, are studied with scanning electron microscopy. Sensilla trichodea / chaetica type recognition is based on their external morphology and ratio of their size to diameter. The flagellum Bourgoin’s organ is a complex sensory unit with 2–3 internal sensilla coeloconica. During nymphal stages, the sensory surface available for a chemoreceptive function particularly increases with the number and size of sensilla placodea on the antennal pedicel. From first to fourth instar and to adult males and females, plate organ sensory surface is estimated to increase respectively by 33x, 68x and 125x (= 2.72 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.02 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively for males and females). The most important increase (5x) occurs between second and third instar. In parallel, a distinctive pair of plate organs on the flagellum decreases in size from first to third instar, and disappears. Sexual dimorphism occurs in sensilla placodea in adults. Diversity, disparity and evolution of nymphal sensilla, and their sexual dimorphism in adults are discussed in the context of the species and planthopper behaviour.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194995</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194995</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Relating antennal sensilla diversity and possible species behaviour in the planthopper pest &amp;lt;i&gt;Lycorma delicatula&amp;lt;/i&gt; (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha: Fulgoridae)</title><fingerprint>9df78e53</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rong-Rong Wang, Jia-Jia Liu, Xin-Yu Li, Ai-Ping Liang, Thierry Bourgoin&lt;/p&gt;

This study asks the question on which national “shoulders” the world’s top-level research stands. Traditionally, the number of citations to national papers has been the evaluative measures of national scientific standings. We raise a different question: instead of analyzing the citations to a countries’ articles (the forward view), we examine references to prior publications from specific countries cited in the most elite publications (the backward—citing—view). “Elite publications” are operationalized as the top-1% most-highly cited articles. Using the articles published from 2004 to 2013, we examine the research referenced in these works. Our results confirm the well-known fact that China has emerged to become a major player in science. However, China still belongs to the low contributors when countries are ranked as contributors to the cited references in top-1% articles. Using this perspective, the results do not support a decreasing trend for the USA; in fact, the USA exceeds expectations (compared to its publication share) in terms of references in the top-1% articles. Switzerland, Sweden, and the Netherlands also appear at the top of the list. However, the results for Germany are lower than statistically expected.</description><engagement>11</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194805</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194805</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>The geography of references in elite articles: Which countries contribute to the archives of knowledge?</title><fingerprint>8e2a8d69</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lutz Bornmann, Caroline Wagner, Loet Leydesdorff&lt;/p&gt;

Rhizobacteria associated with crops constitute an important source of potentially beneficial microorganisms with plant growth promoting activity or antagonistic effects against phytopathogens. In this study, we evaluated the plant growth promoting activity of 11 bacterial isolates that were obtained from the rhizosphere of healthy avocado trees and from that of avocado trees having survived root rot infestations. Seven bacterial isolates, belonging to the genera &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arthrobacter&lt;/i&gt;, promoted &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; growth of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. These isolates were then tested for antagonistic activity against &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt;, in direct dual culture assays. Two of those rhizobacterial isolates, obtained from symptomatic-declining trees, displayed antagonistic activity. Isolate A8a, which is closely related to &lt;i&gt;Bacillus acidiceler&lt;/i&gt;, was also able to inhibit &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; growth &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by 76% through the production of volatile compounds. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) and analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) allowed to tentatively identify the main volatiles emitted by isolate A8a as 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, 6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-one and 3-amino-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one. These volatile compounds have been reported to show antifungal activity when produced by other bacterial isolates. These results confirm the significance of rhizobacteria and suggest that these bacteria could be used for biocontrol of soil borne oomycetes through their volatiles emissions.</description><engagement>63</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194665</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194665</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria associated with avocado display antagonistic activity against &amp;lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&amp;lt;/i&gt; through volatile emissions</title><fingerprint>b5a3221c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alfonso Méndez-Bravo, Elvis Marian Cortazar-Murillo, Edgar Guevara-Avendaño, Oscar Ceballos-Luna, Benjamín Rodríguez-Haas, Ana L.

S.</name></author><description>Background: Machine learning methods have gained popularity and practicality in identifying linear and non-linear effects of variants associated with complex disease/traits. Detection of epistatic interactions still remains a challenge due to the large number of features and relatively small sample size as input, thus leading to the so-called &amp;quot;short fat data&amp;quot; problem. The efficiency of machine learning methods can be increased by limiting the number of input features. Thus, it is very important to perform variable selection before searching for epistasis. Many methods have been evaluated and proposed to perform feature selection, but no single method works best in all scenarios. We demonstrate this by conducting two separate simulation analyses to evaluate the proposed collective feature selection approach. Results: Through our simulation study we propose a collective feature selection approach to select features that are in the &amp;quot;union&amp;quot; of the best performing methods. We explored various parametric, non-parametric, and data mining approaches to perform feature selection. We choose our top performing methods to select the union of the resulting variables based on a user-defined percentage of variants selected from each method to take to downstream analysis. Our simulation analysis shows that non-parametric data mining approaches, such as MDR, may work best under one simulation criteria for the high effect size (penetrance) datasets, while non-parametric methods designed for feature selection, such as Ranger and Gradient boosting, work best under other simulation criteria. Thus, using a collective approach proves to be more beneficial for selecting variables with epistatic effects also in low effect size datasets and different genetic architectures. Following this, we applied our proposed collective feature selection approach to select the top 1% of variables to identify potential interacting variables associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in ~44,000 samples obtained from Geisinger&apos;s MyCode Community Health Initiative (on behalf of DiscovEHR collaboration). Conclusions: In this study, we were able to show that selecting variables using a collective feature selection approach could help in selecting true positive epistatic variables more frequently than applying any single method for feature selection via simulation studies. We were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of collective feature selection along with a comparison of many methods in our simulation analysis. We also applied our method to identify non-linear networks associated with obesity.</description><engagement>1</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293365v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293365v1?rss=1</link><published>1522652400000</published><title>Collective feature selection to identify crucial epistatic variants [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>58c7b2e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Machine learning methods have gained popularity and practicality in identifying linear and non-linear effects of variants associated with complex disease/traits.

Tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, requires two phosphorylation steps to form a competitive inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. Adenylate kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;) has been previously demonstrated to phosphorylate tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate, while creatine kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;), pyruvate kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;) and pyruvate kinase, liver and red blood cell (&lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt;) each have been found to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to the pharmacologically active tenofovir-diphosphate. In the present study, genomic DNA isolated from dried blood spots collected from 505 participants from Bangkok, Thailand; Cape Town, South Africa; and New York City, USA were examined for variants in &lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt; using next-generation sequencing. The bioinformatics tools SIFT and PolyPhen predicted that 19 of the 505 individuals (3.7% frequency) carried variants in at least one kinase that would result in a decrease or loss of enzymatic activity. To functionally test these predictions, AK2 and AK2 variants were expressed in and purified from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, followed by investigation of their activities towards tenofovir. Interestingly, we found that purified AK2 had the ability to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to tenofovir-diphosphate in addition to phosphorylating tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate. Further, four of the six AK2 variants predicted to result in a loss or decrease of enzyme function exhibited a ≥30% decrease in activity towards tenofovir in our in vitro assays. Of note, an AK2 K28R variant resulted in a 72% and 81% decrease in the formation of tenofovir-monophosphate and tenofovir-diphosphate, respectively. These data suggest that there are naturally occurring genetic variants that could potentially impact TFV activation.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Discovery of genetic variants of the kinases that activate tenofovir among individuals in the United States, Thailand, and South Africa: HPTN067</title><fingerprint>9a832a89</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dominique B.

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study was aimed at a serial evaluation and comparison of the prognostic values of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores for neurologic outcomes in comatose, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors, treated with targeted temperature management (TTM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analysed a prospective cohort of comatose OHCA patients, with TTM, admitted to an emergency intensive care unit (ICU), between January 2010 and December 2015. SOFA and APACHE II scores were calculated initially, and then at day 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after ICU admission. Primary and secondary outcomes were the 28-day neurologic outcome and the 28-day mortality, respectively. Prognostic value of the SOFA and APACHE II scores was analysed using the receiver operating characteristic curve.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 143 selected patients, 62 survived and 34 had good neurologic outcomes at day 28. There was no significant difference in the SOFA and extracerebral SOFA scores between the good and poor neurologic outcome groups. However, the APACHE II scores were significantly higher in the good outcome group; they displayed good discriminatory power in predicting poor outcomes, unlike the SOFA scores. The APACHE II score at day 3 had the highest prognostic value for predicting poor neurologic outcomes with an area under the cure of 0.793, and with a cut-off value of 20, the APACHE II score predicted poor neurologic outcomes with a sensitivity of 43.75%, a specificity of 94.12%, a positive predictive value of 94.59%, and a negative predictive value of 41.56%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Identifying APACHE II score might assist as one piece of multimodal prognostic approach for the assessment of neurologic outcomes in OHCA survivors treated with TTM.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195628</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195628</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Serial evaluation of SOFA and APACHE II scores to predict neurologic outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with targeted temperature management</title><fingerprint>5d87e8eb</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jae Chol Yoon, Youn-Jung Kim, You-Jin Lee, Seung Mok Ryoo, Chang Hwan Sohn, Dong-Woo Seo, Yoon-Seon Lee, Jae Ho Lee, Kyoung Soo Lim, Won Young Kim&lt;/p&gt;

The relationship between the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of neural systems is of central importance in brain network science. It is an open question, however, how the SC-FC relationship depends on specific topological features of brain networks or the models used for describing neural dynamics. Using a basic but general model of discrete excitable units that follow a susceptible—excited—refractory activity cycle (SER model), we here analyze how the network activity patterns underlying functional connectivity are shaped by the characteristic topological features of the network. We develop an analytical framework for describing the contribution of essential topological elements, such as common inputs and pacemakers, to the coactivation of nodes, and demonstrate the validity of the approach by comparison of the analytical predictions with numerical simulations of various exemplar networks. The present analytic framework may serve as an initial step for the mechanistic understanding of the contributions of brain network topology to brain dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-BJLyjXZ7qg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523307600000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162ab8d3c72:d9a77:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arnaud Messé, Marc-Thorsten Hütt, Claus C.

Following the indication of the World Health Organization, a national plan for the elimination of measles was approved in Italy and this included the improvement of the molecular surveillance of measles viruses and the interruption of indigenous transmission of the disease. Nevertheless, large outbreaks continue to occur in almost all regions of the country, including Sicily. Here we describe the epidemiology and molecular dynamics of measles viruses as a result of the measles surveillance activity carried out by the “Reference Laboratory for Measles and Rubella” in Sicily over a 5-year period. Biological samples of 259 suspected measles cases were tested for viral RNA detection and a total of 223 (86.1%) were classified as laboratory confirmed. The median age of confirmed measles cases was 21.0 years and about half of them were adults aged 19 years and older. Overall, one-third of the patients showed clinical complications and these latter were more common among adults than children (44.9% &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. 25.7%). The vast majority of measles cases were unvaccinated (94.2%, n = 210). The phylogenetic analysis of 221 measles virus nucleotide sequences revealed sporadic detections of genotypes D4 and H1, while endemic circulation of genotypes D8 and B3 was documented. Genotype D8 was associated with epidemics occurred between 2013 and 2016, whereas genotype B3 was more recently introduced into Sicily characterizing the current measles outbreak. The results of this study confirm the autochthonous co-circulation of viral variants belonging to different genotypes during the study period, and emphasizes the need of measles surveillance programmes in order to investigate the viral dynamics, the pathways of disease transmission, and to eventually adapt the development of successfull vaccine formulations.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195256</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195256</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>Case-based surveillance of measles in Sicily during 2012-2017: The changing molecular epidemiology and implications for vaccine strategies</title><fingerprint>b8c64933</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Tramuto, Carmelo Massimo Maida, Fanny Pojero, Giuseppina Maria Elena Colomba, Alessandra Casuccio, Vincenzo Restivo, Francesco Vitale&lt;/p&gt;

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence rate and associated factors of co-morbid mental disability among the elderly with motor disability. Data was obtained from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability (CNSSD). 250,752 older adults aged 65 years and above were sampled from 5964 sites, 2980 towns, 734 counties in 31 provinces in China. Descriptive statistics were used for population-weighted numbers and prevalence of co-morbid mental disability by different characteristics. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the association between mental disability, and the factors of co-morbid mental disability among physical disability. Among the elderly with motor disability, 275,607 persons (2.28%, 99% CI: 1.97–2.59) had co-morbid mental disability at the survey time, which was significantly higher than those without motor disability (OR: 2.11, 99% CI: 1.83–2.43). The factors associated with a higher risk of co-morbid mental disability included urban areas (OR: 1.38; 99% CI: 1.04–1.84), east (2.60, 1.76–3.83) or west (1.65, 1.06–2.55) regions, having other co-morbid disabilities (5.93, 4.48–7.85), and having more severe motor disability (Moderate: 1.81, 1.28–2.57; Severe: 2.90, 2.08–4.04; Extremely severe: 4.22, 2.96–6.01). The elderly with motor disability have a high risk of co-morbid mental disability, especially for higher socioeconomic groups. These findings highlight the need of and will be beneficial for implementing more comprehensive prevention and rehabilitation strategies, to prevent and control the emergence and development of multiple disabilities and promote the physical and mental health of the elderly.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195555</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195555</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Co-morbid mental disability among Chinese elderly with motor disability: Based on a nationwide survey</title><fingerprint>4c1b2e96</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guo, Ping He, Xinming Song, Gong Chen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Human protection policies require favorable risk–benefit judgments prior to launch of clinical trials. For phase I and II trials, evidence for such judgment often stems from preclinical efficacy studies (PCESs). We undertook a systematic investigation of application materials (investigator brochures [IBs]) presented for ethics review for phase I and II trials to assess the content and properties of PCESs contained in them. Using a sample of 109 IBs most recently approved at 3 institutional review boards based at German Medical Faculties between the years 2010–2016, we identified 708 unique PCESs. We then rated all identified PCESs for their reporting on study elements that help to address validity threats, whether they referenced published reports, and the direction of their results. Altogether, the 109 IBs reported on 708 PCESs. Less than 5% of all PCESs described elements essential for reducing validity threats such as randomization, sample size calculation, and blinded outcome assessment. For most PCESs (89%), no reference to a published report was provided. Only 6% of all PCESs reported an outcome demonstrating no effect. For the majority of IBs (82%), all PCESs were described as reporting positive findings. Our results show that most IBs for phase I/II studies did not allow evaluators to systematically appraise the strength of the supporting preclinical findings. The very rare reporting of PCESs that demonstrated no effect raises concerns about potential design or reporting biases. Poor PCES design and reporting thwart risk–benefit evaluation during ethical review of phase I/II studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Lvi8iDwsCE0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e7:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Wieschowski, William Wei Lim Chin, Carole Federico, Sören Sievers, Jonathan Kimmelman, Daniel Strech&lt;/p&gt;

Compensatory growth (CG), an accelerated growth phenomenon which occurs following a period of dietary restriction is utilised worldwide in animal production systems as a management practise to lower feed costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of jejunal epithelial to CG in cattle through transcriptional profiling following a period of dietary restriction as well as subsequent re-alimentation induced CG. Sixty Holstein Friesian bulls were separated into two groups; RES and ADLIB, with 30 animals in each. RES animals were offered a restricted diet for 125 days (Period 1) followed by &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; feeding for 55 days (Period 2). ADLIB animals had &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; access to feed across both periods 1 and 2. At the end of each period, 15 animals from each treatment group were slaughtered, jejunal epithelium collected and RNAseq analysis performed. Animals that were previously diet restricted underwent CG, gaining 1.8 times the rate of their non-restricted counterparts. Twenty-four genes were differentially expressed in RES compared to ADLIB animals at the end of Period 1, with only one gene, &lt;i&gt;GSTA1&lt;/i&gt;, differentially expressed between the two groups at the end of Period 2. When analysed within treatment (RES, Period 2 v Period 1), 31 genes were differentially expressed between diet restricted and animals undergoing CG. Dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation were associated with altered expression of genes involved in digestion and metabolism as well as those involved in cellular division and growth. Compensatory growth was also associated with greater expression of genes involved in cellular protection and detoxification in jejunal epithelium. This study highlights some of the molecular mechanisms regulating the response to dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation induced CG in cattle; however the gene expression results suggest that most of the CG in jejunal epithelium had occurred by day 55 of re-alimentation.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194445</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194445</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Effect of dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation on the transcriptional profile of bovine jejunal epithelium</title><fingerprint>5dbf6264</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kate Keogh, Sinead M.

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an incurable and rare hereditary syndrome. In recent times, treatment with glucocorticoid analogues has been shown to improve the neurological symptoms that characterize this condition, but the molecular mechanism of action of these analogues remains unknown. Hence, the aim of this study was to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of action of glucocorticoid analogues in the treatment of A-T by investigating the role of Dexamethasone (Dexa) in A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines. We used 2DE and tandem MS to identify proteins that were influenced by the drug in A-T cells but not in healthy cells. Thirty-four proteins were defined out of a total of 746±63. Transcriptome analysis was performed by microarray and showed the differential expression of 599 A-T and 362 wild type (WT) genes and a healthy un-matching between protein abundance and the corresponding gene expression variation. The proteomic and transcriptomic profiles allowed the network pathway analysis to pinpoint the biological and molecular functions affected by Dexamethasone in Dexa-treated cells. The present integrated study provides evidence of the molecular mechanism of action of Dexamethasone in an A-T cellular model but also the broader effects of the drug in other tested cell lines.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195388</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195388</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>Proteomics and transcriptomics analyses of ataxia telangiectasia cells treated with Dexamethasone</title><fingerprint>622b1adb</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michele Menotta, Sara Orazi, Anna Maria Gioacchini, Chiara Spapperi, Anastasia Ricci, Luciana Chessa, Mauro Magnani&lt;/p&gt;

The anatomical location of adipose tissue might have direct implications for its functionality and risk of cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels may be thermogenically more active in specific areas of the body, releasing substances that regulate vascular metabolism. In humans, the phenotypic characteristics of adipose tissue surrounding the aorta and the cardiovascular disease risk that it might entail remain largely unknown. Here, we compared thermogenesis-related molecular features of human periaortic adipose tissue samples with those of subcutaneous adipose tissue, obtained by sternotomy from 42 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. To determine the expression of genes related to energy expenditure and the levels of some adipokines, histological examinations, quantitative PCR, and protein expression measurements in adipocyte precursor cells were performed. Periaortic adipocytes were smaller than those from subcutaneous tissue. Moreover, weight gain induced periaortic adipocyte hypertrophy (r = -0.91, p&amp;lt;0.01). Compared to subcutaneous tissue, adiponectin, FABP4, IL-4 and IL-6 was decreased in periaortic adipocytes, whereas FGF21, UCP-1, PGC-1a, CITED1, Omentin and TFAM (Mitochondrial protein) increased. Upon analyzing patients’ clinical conditions, it emerged that the levels of PGC-1a both in male (r = -0.48 p&amp;lt;0.04) and female (r = -0.61, p&amp;lt;0.05) and TFAM in male (r = -0.72, p&amp;lt;0.0008) and female (r = -0.86, p&amp;lt;0.002) decreased significantly with progressive weight gain. However, no differences were observed in patients with diabetes mellitus 2 or Hyperlipidemia. Adipocytes surrounding the ascending aorta present markers of major thermogenic activity than those in subcutaneous tissue. Nevertheless, this characteristic might change, due to unfavorable metabolic conditions such as obesity, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194269</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194269</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Thermogenic capacity of human periaortic adipose tissue is transformed by body weight</title><fingerprint>efb78e8a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Vargas, Carolina López, Edward Acero, Edgar Benitez, Angélica Wintaco, Jaime Camacho, Marisol Carreño, Juan Umaña, Daniela Jimenez, Said Díaz, Fernando Lizcano&lt;/p&gt;

Nevertheless, this characteristic might change, due to unfavorable metabolic conditions such as obesity, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194269</canonicalUrl><updated>1521493200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f3:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-525d</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Benoit Labonté</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrigendum: Sex-specific transcriptional signatures in human depression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum: Sex-specific transcriptional signatures in human depression, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-525d&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm0418-525d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Corrigendum: Sex-specific transcriptional signatures in human depression&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/UGO491K1yao&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-525d</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/UGO491K1yao/nm0418-525d</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-525d</link><published>1523343600000</published><title>Corrigendum: Sex-specific transcriptional signatures in human depression</title><fingerprint>589d04d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrigendum: Sex-specific transcriptional signatures in human depression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum: Sex-specific transcriptional signatures in human depression, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-525d&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm0418-525d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Corrigendum: Sex-specific transcriptional signatures in human depression&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/UGO491K1yao&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_162b039947a:1dcc860:923c4a60</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523374986362</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00103</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Yoshinori Matsuura, Michiyo Takehira, George I.

The bacterial phylum Verrucomicrobia was formally described two decades ago and originally believed to be a minor member of many ecosystems; however, it is now recognized as ubiquitous and abundant in both soil and aquatic systems. Nevertheless, knowledge of the drivers of its relative abundance and within-phylum habitat preferences remains sparse, especially in lake systems. Here, we documented the distribution of Verrucomicrobia in 12 inland lakes in Southeastern Michigan, a Laurentian Great Lake (Lake Michigan), and a freshwater estuary, which span a gradient in lake sizes, depths, residence times, and trophic states. A wide range of physical and geochemical parameters was covered by sampling seasonally from the surface and bottom of each lake, and by separating samples into particle-associated and free-living fractions. On average, Verrucomicrobia was the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most abundant phylum (range 1.7–41.7%). Fraction, season, station, and depth explained up to 70% of the variance in Verrucomicrobia community composition and preference for these habitats was phylogenetically conserved at the class-level. When relative abundance was linearly modeled against environmental data, Verrucomicrobia and non-Verrucomicrobia bacterial community composition correlated to similar quantitative environmental parameters, although there were lake system-dependent differences and &gt; 55% of the variance remained unexplained. A majority of the phylum exhibited preference for the particle-associated fraction and two classes (Opitutae and Verrucomicrobiae) were identified to be more abundant during the spring season. This study highlights the high relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia in north temperate lake systems and expands insights into drivers of within-phylum habitat preferences of the Verrucomicrobia.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195112</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195112</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Verrucomicrobia are prevalent in north-temperate freshwater lakes and display class-level preferences between lake habitats</title><fingerprint>a8448726</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Edna Chiang, Marian L.

This study highlights the high relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia in north temperate lake systems and expands insights into drivers of within-phylum habitat preferences of the Verrucomicrobia.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195112</canonicalUrl><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca425a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-r?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>Pujanandez, L.</name></author><engagement>1</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-r?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-r?rss=1</link><published>1523554636000</published><title>Can wound healing worsen metastasis?</title><fingerprint>92fba6f2</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/166.18.full</canonicalUrl><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fececf:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>0.02</engagementRate></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2930.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>David Angeles-Albores, Carmie Puckett Robinson, Brian A.

Our objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness of shorter versus longer duration antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections in adults and children in secondary care settings, using the evidence from published systematic reviews. We conducted electronic searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Cinahl. Our primary outcome was clinical resolution. The quality of included reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR criteria, and the quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE criteria. We included 6 systematic reviews (n = 3,162). Four reviews were rated high quality, and two of moderate quality. In adults, there was no difference between shorter versus longer duration in clinical resolution rates for peritonitis (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 24%), or acute pyelonephritis and septic UTI (clinical failure: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.18). The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate. In children, there was no difference in clinical resolution rates for pneumonia (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 48%), pyelonephritis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04) and confirmed bacterial meningitis (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.11, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. In conclusion, there is currently a limited body of evidence to clearly assess the clinical benefits of shorter versus longer duration antibiotics in secondary care. High quality trials assessing strategies to shorten antibiotic treatment duration for bacterial infections in secondary care settings should now be a priority.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194858</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194858</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Overview of systematic reviews assessing the evidence for shorter versus longer duration antibiotic treatment for bacterial infections in secondary care</title><fingerprint>72922a03</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Igho J.

Studies conducted during the past few years have confirmed active West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in Serbia. Based on these studies and the epidemiological situation, the Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection launched national WNV surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015. The programmes encompassed the territory of Serbia and were conducted by the veterinary service in collaboration with entomologists and ornithologists. The objective of the programmes was early detection of WNV and timely reporting to the public health service and local authorities to increase both clinical and mosquito control preparedness. The WNV surveillance programmes were based on direct and indirect surveillance of the presence of WNV by the serological testing of initially seronegative sentinel horses and chickens as well as through viral detection in pooled mosquito and wild bird samples. The most intense WNV circulation was observed in all seven districts of Vojvodina Province (northern Serbia) and Belgrade City, where most of the positive samples were detected among sentinel animals, mosquitoes and wild birds. The West Nile virus surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015 showed satisfactory results in their capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for humans and their sensitivity to early detect viral circulation at the enzootic level. Most of the human cases were preceded by the detection of WNV circulation as part of the surveillance programmes. According to the existing data, it can be reasonably assumed that WNV infection, now an endemic infection in Serbia, will continue to present a significant problem for the veterinary service and public health.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195439</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195439</link><published>1523048400000</published><title>Methodology and results of integrated WNV surveillance programmes in Serbia</title><fingerprint>f4d07f1d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tamaš Petrović, Milanko Šekler, Dušan Petrić, Sava Lazić, Zoran Debeljak, Dejan Vidanović, Aleksandra Ignjatović Ćupina, Gospava Lazić, Diana Lupulović, Mišo Kolarević, Budimir Plavšić&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Intertidal rock pools where fish and invertebrates are in constant close contact due to limited space and water level fluctuations represent ideal conditions to promote life cycles in parasites using these two alternate hosts and to study speciation processes that could contribute to understanding the roles of parasitic species in such ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;Gall bladder and liver samples from five clinid fish species (Blenniiformes: Clinidae) were morphologically and molecularly examined to determine the diversity, prevalence, distribution and host specificity of &lt;i&gt;Ceratomyxa&lt;/i&gt; parasites (Cnidaria: Myxozoa) in intertidal habitats along the coast of South Africa. Phylogenetic relationships of clinid ceratomyxids based on the SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA and ITS regions were assessed additionally to the investigation of population genetic structure of &lt;i&gt;Ceratomyxa cottoidii&lt;/i&gt; and subsequent comparison with the data known from type fish host &lt;i&gt;Clinus cottoides&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Results and discussion &lt;p&gt;Seven &lt;i&gt;Ceratomyxa&lt;/i&gt; species including previously described &lt;i&gt;Ceratomyxa dehoopi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cottoidii&lt;/i&gt; were recognized in clinids. They represent a diverse group of rapidly evolving, closely related species with a remarkably high prevalence in their hosts, little host specificity and frequent concurrent infections, most probably as a result of parasite radiation after multiple speciation events triggered by limited host dispersal within restricted spaces. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cottoidii&lt;/i&gt; represents the most common clinid parasite with a population structure characterized by young expanding populations in the south west and south east coast and by older populations in equilibrium on the west coast of its distribution.

The mouse insulin gene2 (Ins2) has two splice variants; long (Ins2L) and short (Ins2S), that differ only in their 5’UTR sequence and Ins2S is the major transcript which translate more efficiently as compared to Ins2L. Here, we show that cellular factors bind preferentially to the Ins2L 5’UTR, and that PABP and HuD can bind to Ins2 splice variants and regulate its translation. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; binding assay with insulin 5’UTR and different HuD isoforms indicate that the ‘N’ terminal region of HuD is important for RNA binding and insulin translation repression. Using reporter assay we showed that specifically full-length HuD A isoform represses translation of reporter containing insulin 5’UTR. We further show that PABP and HuD interact with each other in RNA-dependent manner and this interaction is affected by glucose and PDI (5’UTR associated translation activator). These results suggest that PABP interacts with HuD in basal glucose conditions making translation inhibitory complex, however upon glucose stimulation this association is affected and PABP is acted upon by PDI resulting in stimulation of insulin translation. Together, our findings snapshot the mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of insulin biosynthesis.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194482</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194482</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Interaction of HuDA and PABP at 5&apos;UTR of mouse insulin2 regulates insulin biosynthesis</title><fingerprint>cec3ed0e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Poonam R.

During the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century the discussion on early human behavioral patterns revolved around the &lt;i&gt;hunting versus scavenging&lt;/i&gt; debate. The correct identification of bone modifications, including percussion, cut and tooth marks, is a key issue within this debate. While many authors have shown that carnivore and human modifications can be easily distinguished, it is true that sometimes percussion marks without associated microstriations and tooth pits overlap morphologically, causing confusion, especially when unmodified hammerstones are used. In order to solve this equifinality problem, many investigations have focused their efforts on other pieces of evidence such as the identification of notches, fragmentation patterns and frequencies, among others. These studies, however, cannot be considered as fully conclusive. Within this paper we address the problem of equifinality when identifying percussion marks produced with unmodified hammerstones and tooth pits created by carnivores using new methodologies based on the 3D reconstruction of marks and their statistical multivariate analysis. For the purpose of this study a total of 128 marks– 39 percussion marks produced with an unmodified quartzite hammerstone, and 89 pits generated by different carnivores–were virtually modelled with the aid of a DAVID structured-light scanner SLS-2 and later analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. Our results show that percussion marks not associated with striae fields and the pits generated by the carnivores studied here can be successfully distinguished.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194324</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194324</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Differentiating percussion pits and carnivore tooth pits using 3D reconstructions and geometric morphometrics</title><fingerprint>a2c9073e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by José Yravedra, Julia Aramendi, Miguel Ángel Maté-González, Lloyd Austin Courtenay, Diego González-Aguilera&lt;/p&gt;

To ensure optimal calcium accrual in the fetal skeleton, a substantial rise occurs in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D), but is dependent on sufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D). Large longitudinal studies addressing free 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D during pregnancy are scarce. We aimed to assess levels of and relationship between 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and free 25(OH)D during pregnancy; determinants of vitamin D status; and association between vitamin D indices or PTH and pregnancy outcomes (gestational diabetes mellitus and birthweight). Altogether 855 pregnant Norwegian Caucasian women from Trondheim and Stavanger (latitude 63°N and 58°N) were recruited; 94 were lost to follow-up. The study was originally a randomized controlled trial (2007–2009) with gestational diabetes as primary outcome. Data were collected in second and third trimester.

To ensure optimal calcium accrual in the fetal skeleton, a substantial rise occurs in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D), but is dependent on sufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D). Large longitudinal studies addressing free 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D during pregnancy are scarce. We aimed to assess levels of and relationship between 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and free 25(OH)D during pregnancy; determinants of vitamin D status; and association between vitamin D indices or PTH and pregnancy outcomes (gestational diabetes mellitus and birthweight). Altogether 855 pregnant Norwegian Caucasian women from Trondheim and Stavanger (latitude 63°N and 58°N) were recruited; 94 were lost to follow-up. The study was originally a randomized controlled trial (2007–2009) with gestational diabetes as primary outcome. Data were collected in second and third trimester. In third trimester, 246 (34%) had vitamin D insufficiency and 52 (7%) deficiency (25(OH)D &amp;lt;50 and &amp;lt;30nmol/L, respectively). During wintertime in third trimester, 61 (47%) from Trondheim and 23 (51%) from Stavanger exhibited vitamin D insufficiency. PTH was elevated in 27 (3.7%). Estimate of change between trimesters was (95% CI): 25(OH)D -1.8 (-2.8 to -0.7) nmol/L, DBP 0.62 (0.57 to 0.66) μmol/L, calculated free 25(OH)D -1.7 (-2.0 to -1.4) pmol/L, PTH 0.81 (0.72 to 0.90) pmol/L, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D (sub-analysis) 31.4 (CI 24.7 to 38.2) pmol/L. A decrease in 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D occurred in 45% of those with vitamin D deficiency, and they also exhibited lower levels than women with adequate vitamin D status.

Background &lt;p&gt;Access to medicines without prescription is a major contributing factor for self-medication practices. This study was designed to examine the ratio of non-prescribed medicines sales and self-medication practices in Punjab, Pakistan. This study also evaluates the reasons for self-medication within its communities.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An observational study was conducted in 272 systemically selected pharmacies to analyze medicines-related sales, with or without prescription. A cross-sectional survey was performed between June 2015 and November 2016. Consumers were interviewed about their self-medication practices.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the pharmacies surveyed, 65.3% participated in the study. A total of 4348 medicines were purchased for self-medication by 3037 consumers (15.2% of all study participants), of which 873 (28.7%) participated in an interview. Majority (81.2%) medicine purchaser, (90.9%) interview participants, and (59.4%) drug users were male. On average, each community pharmacy sold 7.9 medicines without prescription each day, to an average of 5.5 customers. Many participants (28.9%) had matriculation in their formal education. The medicines most often sold for self-medication were analgesics and antipyretics(39.4%). More than 25% of participants reported fever symptoms and 47.8% assumed their illness was too trivial to consult a doctor. Media advertisements were the most common source of information for participants (46.7%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Many types of medicines were often sold without prescription from community pharmacies. Self-medication was common practice for a wide range of illnesses. Pakistan also needs effective implementation of policies to monitor medication sales. Public education about rational medication and limits to advertising medicine are very necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194240</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194240</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Pattern of medication selling and self-medication practices: A study from Punjab, Pakistan</title><fingerprint>d1cee63c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Majid Aziz, Imran Masood, Mahreen Yousaf, Hammad Saleem, Dan Ye, Yu Fang&lt;/p&gt;

Childhood traumas, in the form of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and neglect, are globally widespread and highly prevalent, and associated with a range of subsequent poor health outcomes. This study sought to understand the relationship between physical, sexual and emotional childhood abuse and subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people (18–30) living in urban informal settlements in Durban, South Africa. Data came from self-completed questionnaires amongst 680 women and 677 men comprising the baseline of the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures intervention trial. Men and women were analysed separately. Logistic regression models assessed the relationship between six HIV-risk behaviours and four measures of trauma: the form of trauma, the severity of each trauma, the range of traumas, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Childhood traumas were incredibly prevalent in this population. All childhood traumas were associated with a range of HIV-risk behaviours. This was for the ever/never trauma, as well as the severity of each type of trauma, the range of trauma, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Despite the wider harsh contexts of urban informal settlements, childhood traumas still play a significant role in shaping subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people. Interventions to reduce childhood traumas for populations in informal settlements need to be developed. In addition, trauma focused therapies need to be considered as part of wider HIV-prevention interventions for young adults.

&lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; is a perennial herbaceous plant species mainly distributed in the tropics or subtropics of Asia and Africa. It has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time and now is utilized for the pharmaceutical, chemical and agriculture industries as a valued economic crop. Recently, &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; has attracted tremendous interest because of its high ceramide content. However, the breeding and genome studies are severely limited by the arduous whole genome sequencing of &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, the transcriptome data of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; was obtained by utilizing the high-throughput Illumina sequencing platform. Based on this information, the majority of the significant genes involved in the proposed sphingolipid metabolic pathway were identified. Then, the full-length neutral ceramidase cDNA was obtained with the help of its candidate transcripts, which were acquired from the transcriptome data. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this neutral ceramidase was a real ceramidase by eukaryotic expression in the yeast double knockout mutant Δypc1 Δydc1, which lacks the ceramidases—dihydroCDase (YDC1p), phytoCDase (YPC1p). In addition, the biochemical characterization of purified &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; ceramidase (AmCDase) exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an optimal activity ranging from pH 6.5 to 8.0. Based on our knowledge, this study is the first to report the related information of the neutral ceramidase in &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Japanese encephalitis virus&lt;/i&gt; (JEV) is a major cause of encephalitis in Asia, and the commonest cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis worldwide. Detection of JEV RNA remains challenging due to the characteristic brief and low viraemia, with 0–25% of patients positive, and the mainstay of diagnosis remains detection of anti-JEV IgM antibody.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic review of published RT-PCR protocols, and evaluated them &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; alongside new primers and probes designed using a multiple genome alignment of all JEV strains &gt;9,000nt from GenBank, downloaded from the NCBI website (November 2016). The new assays included pan-genotype and genotype specific assays targeting genotypes 1 and 3.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ten RT-qPCR assays were compared, a pre-existing in-house assay, three published assays and six newly designed assays, using serial RNA dilutions. We selected three assays, one published and two novel assays, with the lowest limit of detection (LOD) for further optimisation and validation. One of the novel assays, detecting NS2A, showed the best results, with LOD approximately 4 copies/ reaction, and no cross-reaction on testing closely related viruses in the JEV serocomplex, &lt;i&gt;West Nile Virus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;St&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Louis Virus&lt;/i&gt;. The optimised assays were validated in consecutive patients with central nervous system infections admitted to hospitals in Laos, testing paired CSF and serum samples.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We succeeded in developing a JEV specific RT-qPCR assay with at least 1 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; improved sensitivity as compared to existing assays.

Aranbaltza is an archaeological complex formed by at least three open-air sites. Between 2014 and 2015 a test excavation carried out in Aranbaltza III revealed the presence of a sand and clay sedimentary sequence formed in floodplain environments, within which six sedimentary units have been identified. This sequence was formed between 137–50 ka, and includes several archaeological horizons, attesting to the long-term presence of Neanderthal communities in this area. One of these horizons, corresponding with Unit 4, yielded two wooden tools. One of these tools is a beveled pointed tool that was shaped through a complex operational sequence involving branch shaping, bark peeling, twig removal, shaping, polishing, thermal exposition and chopping. A use-wear analysis of the tool shows it to have traces related with digging soil so it has been interpreted as representing a digging stick. This is the first time such a tool has been identified in a European Late Middle Palaeolithic context; it also represents one of the first well-preserved Middle Palaeolithic wooden tool found in southern Europe. This artefact represents one of the few examples available of wooden tool preservation for the European Palaeolithic, allowing us to further explore the role wooden technologies played in Neanderthal communities.</description><engagement>48</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195044</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195044</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>A Middle Palaeolithic wooden digging stick from Aranbaltza III, Spain</title><fingerprint>3d1a2f4e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joseba Rios-Garaizar, Oriol López-Bultó, Eneko Iriarte, Carlos Pérez-Garrido, Raquel Piqué, Arantza Aranburu, María José Iriarte-Chiapusso, Illuminada Ortega-Cordellat, Laurence Bourguignon, Diego Garate, Iñaki Libano&lt;/p&gt;

Mosquitoes function as important vectors for many diseases globally and can have substantial negative economic, environmental, and health impacts. Specifically, West Nile virus (WNv) is a significant and increasing threat to wildlife populations and human health throughout North America. Mosquito control is an important means of controlling the spread of WNv, as the virus is primarily spread between avian and mosquito vectors. This is of particular concern for avian host species such as the Greater sage-grouse (&lt;i&gt;Centrocercus urophasianus&lt;/i&gt;), in which WNv negatively impacts fitness parameters. Most mosquito control methods focus on the larval stages. In North America, control efforts are largely limited to larvicides, which require repeated application and have potentially negative ecological impacts. There are multiple potential advantages to using indigenous fish species as an alternative for larval control including lowered environmental impact, decreased costs in terms of time and financial inputs, and the potential for the establishment of self-sustaining fish populations. We tested the efficacy of using fathead minnows (&lt;i&gt;Pimephales promelas&lt;/i&gt;) as biological control for mosquito populations in livestock reservoirs of semiarid rangelands. We introduced minnows into 10 treatment reservoirs and monitored an additional 6 non-treated reservoirs as controls over 3 years. Adult mosquitoes of species known to transmit WNv (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Culex tarsalis&lt;/i&gt;) were captured at each site and mosquito larvae were also present at all sites. Stable isotope analysis confirmed that introduced fathead minnows were feeding at the mosquito larvae trophic level in all but one treatment pond. Treatment ponds demonstrated suppressed levels of mosquito larva over each season compared to controls with a model-predicted 114% decrease in larva density within treatment ponds. Minnows established self-sustaining populations throughout the study in all reservoirs that maintained sufficient water levels. Minnow survival was not influenced by water quality. Though minnows did not completely eradicate mosquito larvae, minnows are a promising alternative to controlling mosquito larvae density within reservoirs. We caution that careful site selection is critical to avoid potential negative impacts, but suggest the introduction of fathead minnows in reservoirs can dramatically reduce mosquito larva abundance and potentially help mitigate vector-borne disease transmission.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194304</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194304</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Assessing the efficacy of fathead minnows (&amp;lt;i&gt;Pimephales promelas&amp;lt;/i&gt;) for mosquito control</title><fingerprint>7538efc3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryan T.

To elucidate the association between renal hyperfiltration (RHF) and incident proteinuria, the data from 11,559,520 Korean adults who had undergone health screenings ≥ 3 times between 2009 and 2014 and had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and negative dipstick test for proteinuria at baseline, were retrospectively analyzed. GFR was estimated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine, and RHF was defined as GFR &gt;95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile adjusted for sex, age, body size, and diabetes and/or hypertension medication. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of incident proteinuria in the RHF was 1.083 (95% CI, 1.069~1.097) compared to that of the non-RHF with Cox regression model. The association between RHF and incident proteinuria was not only in diabetic but also in non-diabetic subjects. This association was not observed in women (p for interaction &amp;lt;0.001). A reverse J-shaped association was found between the adjusted GFR slope and aHR of incident proteinuria. Both lower and higher GFR were associated with incident proteinuria in men. In conclusion, RHF was associated with incident proteinuria in men. Clinical studies are necessary to study whether the alleviation of RHF can prevent incident proteinuria.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195784</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195784</link><published>1523653200000</published><title>Association of renal hyperfiltration with incident proteinuria - A nationwide registry study</title><fingerprint>d150fda6</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Min Lee, Ju-Young Park, Min-Su Park, Jong Heon Park, Minseon Park, Hyung-Jin Yoon&lt;/p&gt;

Amnion is a membrane surrounding the embryo/fetus which determine growth factors and interleukins with angiogenic, immunogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of conditioned culture medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion (hAM CCM) on migration and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial primary cells (HUVECs), freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs), and Jurkat leukemia cell line. Amnion membrane was freshly isolated from healthy placenta and its fragments cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to produce hAM CCM. Members of the IGFBP protein family made up one third of all assayed proteins present in the hAM medium. The hAM CCM did not affect the proliferation rate of HUVECs or MNCs, but we observed more intensive migration of those cells, and lower expression of CD31 surface antigen on HUVECs as compared to control cultures. In contrast, Jurkat cells did not respond to hAM CCM treatment by proliferation or mobility change. The conditioned medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion is easy to obtain and is a convenient source of various growth and other factors that may be useful in practical medicine.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195035</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195035</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Response of human normal and leukemia cells to factors released by amnion fragments &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>93b0fe42</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zofia Grzywocz, Grazyna Hoser, Stanislawa Sabalinska, Piotr Ladyzynski, Jaroslaw Czubak, Malgorzata Dworczynska, Romuald Debski, Ewa Pius-Sadowska, Boguslaw Machalinski, Jerzy Kawiak&lt;/p&gt;

Tuberculosis places a staggering burden on human health globally. The new World Health Organisation End-TB Strategy has highlighted the urgent need for more effective TB vaccines to improve control of the disease. Protein-based subunit vaccines offer potential as safe and effective generators of protective immunity, and the use of particulate vaccine formulation and delivery by the pulmonary route may enhance local immunogenicity. In this study, novel particulate subunit vaccines were developed utilising biodegradable poly(lactic-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycolic acid) (PLGA) slow-release particles as carriers for the &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; lipoprotein MPT83, together with the adjuvants trehalose-dibehenate (TDB) or Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Following delivery by the pulmonary or subcutaneous routes, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these vaccines were assessed in a murine model of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection. When delivered peripherally, these vaccines induced modest, antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 responses, but strong anti-MPT83 antibody responses. Mucosal delivery of the PLGA(MPT83) vaccine, with or without TDB, increased antigen-specific Th17 responses in the lungs, however, PLGA-encapsulated vaccines did not provide protection against &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; challenge. By contrast, peripheral delivery of DDA liposomes containing MPT83 and TDB or MPL, stimulated both Th1 and Th17 responses and generated protection against &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; challenge. Therefore, PLGA-formulated vaccines primarily stimulate strong humoral immunity, or Th17 responses if used mucosally, and may be a suitable carrier for vaccines against extracellular pathogens. This study emphasises the critical nature of the vaccine carrier, adjuvant and route of delivery for optimising vaccine efficacy against TB.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194620</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194620</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>PLGA particulate subunit tuberculosis vaccines promote humoral and Th17 responses but do not enhance control of &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&amp;lt;/i&gt; infection</title><fingerprint>9e5a0462</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anneliese S.

Terrestrial arthropods play an important role in saltmarsh ecosystems, mainly affecting the saltmarsh’s primary production as the main consumers of terrestrial primary production and decomposition. Some of these arthropods, including selected insects and spiders, can be used as ecological indicators of overall marsh environmental health, as they are differentially sensitive to ecological stressors, such as land loss, erosion, oil spills, and tropical storms. In the present study, we used terrestrial arthropods collected from seven (three lightly-oiled, four heavily-oiled) sites in Barataria Bay and from three unoiled reference sites in Delacroix, Louisiana, to determine the impacts of the distribution and re-distribution of &lt;i&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/i&gt; (DWH) oil on these saltmarsh ecosystems. A total of 9,476 and 12,256 insects were collected in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The results show that the terrestrial arthropods were negatively affected by the re-distribution of DWH oil by Hurricane Isaac in 2012, although the level of impacts varied among the arthropod groups. Moreover, the mean diversity index was higher (&gt;1.5) in 2014 than in 2013 (&amp;lt;1.5) for all sites, suggesting a recovery trajectory of the saltmarsh arthropod population. The higher taxonomic richness observed in the reference sites compared to the oiled sites for both years also indicated long-term impacts of DWH oil to the saltmarsh arthropod community. Whereas a slow recovery of certain terrestrial arthropods was observed, long-term monitoring of arthropod communities would help better understand the recovery and succession of the marsh ecosystems.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194941</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194941</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Coupled effects of oil spill and hurricane on saltmarsh terrestrial arthropods</title><fingerprint>24bf6159</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wokil Bam, Linda M.

Wildlife mortality investigations are important for conservation, food safety, and public health; but they are infrequently reported for cryptic chelonian species. Eastern box turtles (&lt;i&gt;Terrapene carolina carolina&lt;/i&gt;) are declining due to anthropogenic factors and disease, and while mortality investigations have been reported for captive and translocated individuals, few descriptions exist for free-living populations. We report the results of four natural mortality event investigations conducted during routine health surveillance of three Illinois box turtle populations in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In April 2011, over 50 box turtles were found dead and a polymicrobial necrotizing bacterial infection was diagnosed in five survivors using histopathology and aerobic/anaerobic culture. This represents the first reported occurrence of necrotizing bacterial infection in box turtles. In August 2013, paired histopathology and qPCR ranavirus detection in nine turtles was significantly associated with occupation of moist microhabitats, identification of oral plaques and nasal discharge on physical exam, and increases in the heterophil count and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In July 2014 and 2015, ranavirus outbreaks reoccurred within a 0.2km radius of highly-disturbed habitat containing ephemeral ponds used by amphibians for breeding. qPCR ranavirus detection in five individuals each year was significantly associated with use of moist microhabitats (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Detection of single and co-pathogens (Terrapene herpesvirus 1, adenovirus, and &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma&lt;/i&gt; sp.) was common before, during, and after mortality events, but improved sample size would be necessary to determine the impacts of these pathogens on the occurrence and outcome of mortality events. This study provides novel information about the causes and predictors of natural box turtle mortality events. Continued investigation of health, disease, and death in free-living box turtles will improve baseline knowledge of morbidity and mortality, identify threats to survival, and promote the formation of effective conservation strategies.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195617</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195617</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Investigation of multiple mortality events in eastern box turtles (&amp;lt;i&gt;Terrapene carolina carolina&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><fingerprint>2c9bb0c1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Adamovicz, Matthew C.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Following its publication in 2008, the Global Nutritional Index (GNI) which captures the triple burden of malnutrition, has been updated to assess the overall nutritional status and nutritional trends of countries, regions and the world, including both under-nutrition and over-nutrition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The GNI was modeled on the Human Development Index, using geometric means of three normalized indicators: protein-energy malnutrition (PEM, measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) from PEM), micronutrient deficiency (MID, measured by DALYs from MID), and penalizing obesity (percent female obesity). GNI (range 0–1) was calculated from 1990–2015 for 186 countries, in seven World Bank income and WHO region groupings.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;World GNI increased from 0.433 to 0.473 as decreased deficits overcompensated for the rise in obesity. GNI for African low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (median 0.301 to 0.392) and South-East Asian LMIC (0.456 to 0.564) improved significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), while for high-income countries (0.657 to 0.611) worsened significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). GNI for American LMIC (0.459 to 0.457), European LMIC (0.571 to 0.575), Eastern Mediterranean LMIC (0.484 to 0.483) and Western Pacific LMIC (0.433 to 0.494) were unchanged. The disaggregation of the GNI showed that in nearly all the seven country groups there was a significant decrease in both PEM and MID (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) (except in HIC where only PEM dropped), and a significant increase in obesity (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These trends are the result of the reciprocal changes between decreased under-nutrition and increased over-nutrition, which has become a major cause of malnutrition worldwide. We suggest, therefore, that future Sustainable Development Goals should include alongside “zero hunger”–“reduce obesity”.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194821</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194821</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Global nutrition 1990–2015: A shrinking hungry, and expanding fat world</title><fingerprint>20cd5c0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wen Peng, Elliot M.

Background &lt;p&gt;South Africa has a high burden of MDR-TB, and to provide accessible treatment the government has introduced different models of care. We report the most cost-effective model after comparing cost per patient successfully treated across 5 models of care: centralized hospital, district hospitals (2), and community-based care through clinics or mobile injection teams.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In an observational study five cohorts were followed prospectively. The cost analysis adopted a provider perspective and economic cost per patient successfully treated was calculated based on country protocols and length of treatment per patient per model of care. Logistic regression was used to calculate propensity score weights, to compare pairs of treatment groups, whilst adjusting for baseline imbalances between groups. Propensity score weighted costs and treatment success rates were used in the ICER analysis. Sensitivity analysis focused on varying treatment success and length of hospitalization within each model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In 1,038 MDR-TB patients 75% were HIV-infected and 56% were successfully treated. The cost per successfully treated patient was 3 to 4.5 times lower in the community-based models with no hospitalization. Overall, the Mobile model was the most cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Reducing the length of hospitalization and following community-based models of care improves the affordability of MDR-TB treatment without compromising its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196003</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196003</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>MDR-TB patients in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Cost-effectiveness of 5 models of care</title><fingerprint>66bfffad</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marian Loveday, Kristina Wallengren, Tarylee Reddy, Donela Besada, James C.

The immunological profiles of human specific IgE (sIgE) and specific IgG4 (sIgG4) vary by genetic predisposition, living conditions in different geographical locations and patient’s age. The aim of our study was to analyze sIgE and sIgG4 patterns and their age-dependent changes in patients from the Moscow region. For identifying sIgE and sIgG4 profiles the blood samples from 513 patients aged 6 months to 17 years who were showing symptoms of allergic diseases were analyzed using microarrays containing 31 allergens. The highest sIgE prevalence was observed for birch pollen (32%) among pollen allergens, cat dander (24%) among indoor allergens, and egg whites (21%) among food allergens. The most common sIgG4 response was developed toward egg whites (80% of patients). Age-related elevation was identified for patients with increased sIgE to pollen allergens and indoor allergens (cat or dog dander and house dust mites). For each allergen, the proportion of cases with significant levels of sIgG4 appeared to increase with patients’ age.

The immunological profiles of human specific IgE (sIgE) and specific IgG4 (sIgG4) vary by genetic predisposition, living conditions in different geographical locations and patient’s age. The aim of our study was to analyze sIgE and sIgG4 patterns and their age-dependent changes in patients from the Moscow region. For identifying sIgE and sIgG4 profiles the blood samples from 513 patients aged 6 months to 17 years who were showing symptoms of allergic diseases were analyzed using microarrays containing 31 allergens. The highest sIgE prevalence was observed for birch pollen (32%) among pollen allergens, cat dander (24%) among indoor allergens, and egg whites (21%) among food allergens. The most common sIgG4 response was developed toward egg whites (80% of patients). Age-related elevation was identified for patients with increased sIgE to pollen allergens and indoor allergens (cat or dog dander and house dust mites). For each allergen, the proportion of cases with significant levels of sIgG4 appeared to increase with patients’ age. The data on allergen-specific sIgE and sIgG4 prevalence show both general trends and some local special aspects that are indicative for the Moscow region. This information should be useful in terms of epidemiology of allergic diseases.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194775</canonicalUrl><updated>1521752400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b2:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Evaluating_the_London_Dispersion_Coefficients_of_Protein_Force_Fields_Using_the_Exchange-Hole_Dipole_Moment_Model/6024410</originId><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>London dispersion is one of the fundamental intermolecular interactions involved in protein folding and dynamics.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Salivary glands are known immune effector sites and considered to be part of the whole mucosal immune system. The aim of the present study was to assess the salivary immune response to rotavirus (RV) infection through the analysis of the cytokine immune profile in saliva.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;A prospective comparative study of serial saliva samples from 27 RV-infected patients (sampled upon admission to the hospital during acute phase and at convalescence—i.e. at least three months after recovery) and 36 healthy controls was performed. Concentrations of 11 salivary cytokines (IFN-γ, IFN-α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL12&lt;sub&gt;p70&lt;/sub&gt;, TNF-α, IFN-λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, IL-22) were determined. Cytokine levels were compared between healthy controls acute infection and convalescence. The correlation between clinical data and salivary cytokine profile in infected children was assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The salivary cytokine profile changes significantly in response to acute RV infection. In RV-infected patients, IL-22 levels were increased in the acute phase with respect to convalescence (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-value &amp;lt; 0.001). Comparisons between infected and control group showed significant differences in salivary IFN-α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-22. Although acute-phase levels of IL-12, IL-10, IL-6 and IFN-γ showed nominal association with Vesikari’s severity, this trend did not reach statistical significance after multiple test adjustment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RV infection induces a host salivary immune response, indicating that immune mucosal response to RV infection is not confined to the intestinal mucosa.

Background &lt;p&gt;Musculoskeletal complaints and injuries (MSCI) are common in military populations. However, only a limited number of studies have followed soldiers during international deployments and investigated the prevalence of MSCI during and at the end of their deployment. The aim was to describe the prevalence of MSCI in different military occupational specialties and categorise their most common tasks in terms of exposures to physical workloads during a six-month long international deployment in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey, including 325 soldiers (300 men), aged 20–62 participating in an international deployment in Afghanistan during the spring of 2012. Soldiers were clustered into different military occupational specialties: Infantry, Administration, Logistics, Logistics/Camp, Medical and Other. Data were collected through the use of the Musculoskeletal Screening Protocol at the end of the international mission.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven percent reported MSCI during deployment, with 28% at the end.The most common locations of MSCI during the mission were lower back, knee, shoulders, upper back, neck and foot, while the knee and lower back prevailed at the end of the mission. Almost half of the soldiers who had MSCI reported affected work ability. The most common duties during the mission were vehicle patrolling, staff duties, guard/security duties, foot patrols and transportation. Soldiers reported that vehicle patrolling, staff duties and transportation were demanding with respect to endurance strength, guard/security duties challenged both maximum and endurance strength while foot patrolling challenged maximum and endurance strength, aerobic and anaerobic endurance and speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MSCI during international deployment are common among Swedish soldiers. The results indicate the need to further develop strategies focusing on matching the soldiers’ capacity to the job requirements, with relevant and fair physical selection-tests during the recruitment process and proactive interventions targeting MSCI before and during deployment, in order to enhance soldiers’ readiness and promote operational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195548</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195548</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Self-reported musculoskeletal complaints and injuries and exposure of physical workload in Swedish soldiers serving in Afghanistan</title><fingerprint>2ae4a2de</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandra Halvarsson, Ingela Hagman, Matthias Tegern, Lisbet Broman, Helena Larsson&lt;/p&gt;

It’s from the IBM Zürich group that has pioneered so much work in this area. Over just the time I’ve been writing this blog, that idea has gone from “Maybe someday” to “In some well-defined &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/09/03/real_molecules&quot;&gt;test cases&lt;/a&gt;” to “A few real-world examples known”, and now perhaps to “Hey, this might actually start working”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it’s not just AFM. There’s also scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), among other even more exotic ideas, and together you can get information that simply cannot be obtained by any other methods. Here they are in that order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFM is done typically by picking up a single CO molecule (from the carbon end) with the tip of the metal probe and scanning with the oxygen end across an adsorbed molecule (at liquid helium temperatures) at a constant height, about 4 Angstroms over the molecule itself. Often you go back and scan at several different tip heights. There are many other possible tips – xenon atoms, other diatomic molecules, halogen atoms, and so on. The cantilever holding the tip is oscillating (over about half an Angstrom) at a high frequency, and changes in this, induced by interactions with the molecule under study, are what get measured out (along with deflections in the angle that the CO molecule makes with the surface).  The mechanism for these changes is just flat-out Pauli repulsion for the most part – electrons not wanting to occupy the same volume of space and getting out of each other’s way – although van der Waals and electrostatic forces can show up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPFM is pretty similar, except the readout is the voltage dependence of the position of the tip relative to the molecule, rather than changes in frequency of oscillation. You pick a voltage that gives you good signal/noise and scan around as with AFM. In practice, that gives you more of a pure electrostatic read on the surface, and it’s very useful for determining charge states and electron density in the sample. For example, fluorine is very close to the size of hydrogen, but they look dramatically different in KPFM because of the mass of electrons around the F atoms. Interpretation of the data, though, is not very straightforward, and often seems to involve matching up the experimental results to various calculations to try to see what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, in STM you apply a voltage to the tip and measure the changes in electric current between the tip and the sample as you scan, often by having the tip height change to keep a constant current level. At these distances, electrons are tunneling right across the gap, so this is sheer quantum mechanics all the way. If you pick the appropriate voltage, electrons can be temporarily attached to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the test molecule (or detached from the highest-occupied, the HOMO, if you flip the voltage around), and the resulting images are absolutely &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt; for someone like me who came up thinking of these as mathematical abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At right is an example of these, with a CO tip used to show the bonds in the graphene-like molecule and then (in STM mode), its LUMO. As you can see, the resolution on these experiments is getting pretty good, and allows for an unequivocal assignment of the structure. Of course, an X-ray structure determination would almost certainly nail that down, too, but for that you have to have a purified sample and a good crystal. One interesting thing about AFM-type techniques is that you can scatter a mixed sample across the surface and take a look at the various things that might be in it, one molecule at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At right is an illustration of something else that can really only be done under AFM conditions: actual atomic-level manipulation of the sample. Individual atoms can be pushed, twanged, or (as in this case) removed entirely. The result can be highly reactive intermediates (radicals, arynes, etc.) that can be studied directly at the liquid-helium temperatures involved. There are also opportunities to do on-surface reaction by heating followed by cooling down to AFM conditions, through photochemistry, etc. You can also study the interaction of individual molecules with each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it has to be said that there are not very many labs that are capable of these things at the moment, but that’s changing with the advent of more commercial apparatus and the spread of experienced workers in the field. What’s lacking? As the authors note, there’s a real need for techniques that might be able to read out functional groups and elements more directly. An even bigger challenge is that all the most spectacular results to date have been on planar or near-planar molecules, since these yield the most (and the most interpretable) data. You’re running your quantum fingers over the surface of things here, so the inside of a folded-up conformation is just not going to be available. And finally, there need to be improvements in the time it takes to get a measurement. It’s been stuck at roughly ten-minutes-per-molecule for a long time, but better time resolution would allow for a lot of new things to be picked up (and for better characterization of mixtures, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

The red flour beetle, &lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/i&gt;, is an important model insect and agricultural pest. However, many standard genetic tools are lacking or underdeveloped in this system. Here, we present a set of new reagents to augment existing &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; genetic tools. We demonstrate a new GAL4 driver line that employs the promoter of a ribosomal protein gene to drive expression of a UAS responder in the fat body. We also present a novel dual fluorescent reporter that labels cell membranes and nuclei with different fluorophores for the analysis of cellular morphology. This approach also demonstrates the functionality of the viral T2A peptide for bicistronic gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt;. To facilitate classical genetic analysis, we created lines with visible genetic markers by CRISPR-mediated disruption of the &lt;i&gt;yellow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ebony&lt;/i&gt; body color loci with a cassette carrying an attP site, enabling future φC31-mediated integration.

I can state as a fact that the first time I heard a joking reference to his attitude towards traditional synthetic organic chemistry was in the summer of 1983, so it’s not like he’s been keeping his thoughts bottled up. But this is certainly a good summary of them, and here’s the key question that’s being asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The ability to put together molecules – bit‐by‐bit, simple or complex – is one of chemistry’s great accomplishments, and a source of amazement to those in many other fields of science. More than one physicist has told me that s/he cannot believe that it is possible to manipulate bonds between individual atoms with the skill that organic chemists do. When I look at a complex structure assembled in a beautifully organized campaign, I also am amazed. That said, all fields of science morph with time. The phrase “organic synthesis” has come to mean “synthesis of structurally complex natural products”, or, perhaps, “synthesis of complicated molecules with pharmaceutical activity.” Nature, and relevance to healthcare, define the targets, and provide the utilitarian justification for the effort. Is there (or should there be) more to it than that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsidiary questions are whether organic synthesis of that sort is worth the effort that’s being put into it and whether it trains students to do useful things and whether other types of work could do a better job of that. In order to address these, Whitesides notes, we have to make sure that we’re talking about the same things. He defines “organic synthesis” (small letters) as any sort of putting-together-of-organic molecules, and “Organic Synthesis” (with the capitals) as the sort of complex and often natural-product-based synthesis practiced by R. B. Woodward, his contemporaries, and his intellectual heirs. The latter is what many people mean by those two words, to be sure, and Whitesides has some questions about just what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the field a science that generates new concepts and new theory? Is it instead more of an art form, driven at least partly by aesthetic choices (that can be appreciated by skilled observers) rather than utility &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;? Or is it something of a craft, achieving its results (in the end) through skilled empirical tinkering? These questions, especially in the way that they’re phrased, are likely to cause intense annoyance in some practitioners. But I think that the annoyance is a sign that these categories are uncomfortably plausible and recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the field partakes of all of these characteristics, but on what proportions? I think that the science/craft distinction is actually one question, and that these are on the same scale with opposite signs: the more solid the theoretical framework, the less Edisonian tinkering. My opinion is toward the Edisonian end. Organic synthesis is not bereft of theories and organizing concepts, but they do not operate strongly enough (that is, in a detailed enough fashion) to allow us to predict (for example) reaction conditions. That’s why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. The same goes for predicting new reactions, which is why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/11/24/reaction_discovery_reviewed&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. No one sat down a few decades ago and said “Y’know, my knowledge of organometallic chemistry allows me to predict that palladium, in particular, will show oxidative addition/reductive elimination behavior that will be spectacularly useful in carbon-carbon bond formation. And while I’m making bold predictions, you might try aryl boronic acids for that reaction first, even though hardly any such things have even been described”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for art, I would very much like to have a dollar for every total-synthesis person who has talked about the field in terms of its artistic qualities. We have Woodward to thank for this – the man was a &lt;em&gt;tremendous&lt;/em&gt; scientist, but his influence has &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/07/22/woodwards-prose-style&quot;&gt;not always been&lt;/a&gt; for the good. I don’t think nearly as many people went into spasms about elegance and beauty in reference to total synthesis before him, and what’s more annoying is that those are valid concepts to apply even if Woodward sometimes came across like an Aubrey Beardsley aesthete about them. My own view is that we should let the artistic qualities of organic synthesis, which exist, speak for themselves. Because if they can’t, no amount of &lt;em&gt;raffiniert&lt;/em&gt; gushing about them will substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitesides isn’t through. That three-parter is just his first of three questions! The second one is a two-parter: is organic synthesis best thought of as an enabling technology to do things (such as make drugs, etc.) or as a framework that lets us ask questions about the nature of molecules and their behavior? That is, are the uses to which we put this field, and the justifications we give for it, best described as practical ones or intellectual ones? We tend to haul out the former first and start talking in better-living-through-(organic)-chemistry style, and that’s understandable. Compounds made through organic synthesis, and available through no other practical means, are crucial underpinnings of the modern world. If we’re not proud of that, what are we to be proud of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that second justification, while it sounds like more aesthetic hand-waving to the lay public (and to funding agencies), has some staying power. Ask the physicists, or even the mathematicians. Asking fundamental questions, and having the right framework in which to be able to ask them, can pay off hugely even from the practical end, intellectual satisfaction aside. There’s a lot of number theory that was just another ornament of mathematics until it became vital for modern cryptography and secure communications (G. H. Hardy would have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2IK9D0o&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;horrified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Relativity was a fantastic intellectual feat by Einstein, but relativistic corrections are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html&quot;&gt;needed&lt;/a&gt; to make the GPS system work correctly, among many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third question is, what should we teach chemistry students about the field? That is, what are the most important things for them to know? There’s a massive pile of empirical knowledge, famously dreaded by sophomores, but it’s taught (or should be!) according to general organizing principles – although those are the very ones that are not quite adequate enough to explain everything that’s going on. At what level should we teach this subject? You can say “Here are reactions that depend on alpha-carbonyl anions, and here’s why they happen”, you can say “Time to learn the difference between the Dieckmann and Claisen condensations”, or “Here are the kinds of products these reactions form and what they’re used for”, or “Here are some tips on how to run these things at the bench”, and on and on. What should be in the syllabus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own take on this is that there should definitely be a bias towards the general principles, which is what the better organic chemistry professors already do. Teaching the subject as a pile of reactions is a crime. I may be too loose about this stuff, but I would rather a student, if it came down to it, mess up a bit on the detailed mechanism of the Mitsunobu reaction if they understand that its driving force is the thermodynamic sink of triphenylphosphine oxide formation. The difference between the Dieckmann and the Claisen condensations is that the former is intramolecular and the latter is intermolecular, but I think it’s a waste of brain space to give them different names and memorize them as such. I would much rather that a student, in this case, immediately recognize the mechanism of an alpha-carbonyl anion attacking an ester carbonyl (no matter what the name associated with that process is) and recognize the influence of the leaving group of the ester, the stability vs. reactivity characteristics of the nucleophile, the likelihood of the various ring sizes being formed in the intramolecular reaction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nowhere near exhausted the Annoying Questions of George Whitesides, but this post is long enough as it is! Look for Part II tomorrow or the next day. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Chemical News</item><item>General Scientific News</item><item>Natural Products</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162ba0b3650:dd4dc9:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523539719760</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/12/the-thoughts-of-george-whitesides-part-i</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25181?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25181?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25181?af=R</link><published>1522114210699</published><unread>False</unread><fingerprint>6f967c6d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626513ab8b:6cde1:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522114210699</crawled></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195036</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Michael R.

We test the hypothesis that prehistoric Native American land use influenced the Euro-American settlement process in a South Carolina Piedmont landscape. Long term ecological studies demonstrate that land use legacies influence processes and trajectories in complex, coupled social and ecological systems. Native American land use likely altered the ecological and evolutionary feedback and trajectories of many North American landscapes. Yet, considerable debate revolves around the scale and extent of land use legacies of prehistoric Native Americans. At the core of this debate is the question of whether or not European colonists settled a mostly “wild” landscape or an already “humanized” landscape. We use statistical event analysis to model the effects of prehistoric Native American settlement on the rate of Colonial land grants (1749–1775). Our results reveal how abandoned Native American settlements were among the first areas claimed and homesteaded by Euro-Americans. We suggest that prehistoric land use legacies served as key focal nodes in the Colonial era settlement process. As a consequence, localized prehistoric land use legacies likely helped structure the long term, landscape- to regional-level ecological inheritances that resulted from Euro-American settlement.</description><engagement>17</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195036</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195036</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Influences of Native American land use on the Colonial Euro-American settlement of the South Carolina Piedmont</title><fingerprint>3d37712b</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael R.

As a consequence, localized prehistoric land use legacies likely helped structure the long term, landscape- to regional-level ecological inheritances that resulted from Euro-American settlement.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195036</canonicalUrl><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1d:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4110</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Biotechnology</title></origin><author><name>Rekha Seshadri</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cultivation and sequencing of rumen microbiome members from the Hungate1000 Collection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultivation and sequencing of rumen microbiome members from the Hungate1000 Collection, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4110&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4110&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rumen microbiome biology gets a boost with the release of 410 high-quality reference genomes from the Hungate1000 project.</description><engagement>119</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4110</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4110</link><published>1521442800000</published><title>Cultivation and sequencing of rumen microbiome members from the Hungate1000 Collection</title><fingerprint>e6d5c0b3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cultivation and sequencing of rumen microbiome members from the Hungate1000 Collection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultivation and sequencing of rumen microbiome members from the Hungate1000 Collection, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4110&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4110&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rumen microbiome biology gets a boost with the release of 410 high-quality reference genomes from the Hungate1000 project.</content></content><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_1623ecd8351:26fb6b9:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/m685/nature-assets/nbt/journal/v36/n4/images/nbt.4110-F1.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width><height>280</height></visual><crawled>1521472078673</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/275032v2?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Najgebauer, H.</name></author><description>The selection of appropriate cancer models is a key prerequisite for maximising translational potential and clinical relevance of in vitro studies.

A common task is to accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a logarithmic fold change (LFC) in expression levels.

They study the vocalizations of marmoset infants with a wide range of techniques that include computational models and experiments that mimic growth reversal. Their results suggest that the qualitative changes that occur during development are rooted in the nonlinear interaction between the nervous system and the biomechanics involved in respiration.

The main drawback of ranking of researchers by the number of papers, citations or by the Hirsch index is ignoring the problem of distributing authorship among authors in multi-author publications. So far, the single-author or multi-author publications contribute to the publication record of a researcher equally. This full counting scheme is apparently unfair and causes unjust disproportions, in particular, if ranked researchers have distinctly different collaboration profiles. These disproportions are removed by less common fractional or authorship-weighted counting schemes, which can distribute the authorship credit more properly and suppress a tendency to unjustified inflation of co-authors. The urgent need of widely adopting a fair ranking scheme in practise is exemplified by analysing citation profiles of several highly-cited astronomers and astrophysicists. While the full counting scheme often leads to completely incorrect and misleading ranking, the fractional or authorship-weighted schemes are more accurate and applicable to ranking of researchers as well as research teams. In addition, they suppress differences in ranking among scientific disciplines. These more appropriate schemes should urgently be adopted by scientific publication databases as the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) or the Scopus (Elsevier).</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195509</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195509</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Fair ranking of researchers and research teams</title><fingerprint>2ac6a229</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Václav Vavryčuk&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Pro-active case detection (Pro-ACD), in the form of voluntary screening and treatment (VSAT) following community mobilisation about ‘asymptomatic malaria’, is currently being evaluated as a tool for &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; elimination in Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A qualitative study was conducted to explore community understanding, perceptions, expectations and acceptability of the Pro-ACD intervention in order to identify aspects that could be improved in future Pro-ACD activities. This was ancillary to a three-round VSAT campaign, carried out in three villages between December 2015 and March 2016. Qualitative data collection began shortly after the end of the three rounds of screening. Purposive sampling was used to select participants. Nine focus group discussions with participants (n = 46) and non-participants (n = 40) in the Pro-ACD screening were conducted, in addition to in-depth interviews with key village figures (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Health promotion messages were well delivered and received, but it was difficult for many villagers to understand the messages around ‘asymptomatic malaria’. Overall, villagers and village leaders had a positive opinion about the VSAT intervention. Acceptability was high, as a direct consequence of favourable perceptions towards the screening activity: the Pro-ACD intervention was seen by the local population as an effective, inexpensive, reliable and readily available tool to protect individuals and the community from the insurgence of malaria. Physical absence and lack of time (both linked to work-related activities) were the main reasons for non-participation.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although VSAT was generally well perceived and accepted, the ‘time factor’ related to the need to satisfy essential daily subsistence requirements played a significant role in determining participation in the screening. More well-adapted and meaningful Pro-ACD approaches could be implemented by improving the timing of the testing activites, and strengthening community participation and engagement to increase acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195809</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195809</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>‘I could not join because I had to work for pay.’: A qualitative evaluation of &amp;lt;i&gt;falciparum&amp;lt;/i&gt; malaria pro-active case detection in three rural Cambodian villages</title><fingerprint>89db08b6</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pierluigi Taffon, Gabriele Rossi, Jean-Marie Kindermans, Rafael Van den Bergh, Chea Nguon, Mark Debackere, Lieven Vernaeve, Martin De Smet, Emilie Venables&lt;/p&gt;

Biomechanical studies have shown the use of suture anchors (SA) to be superior to the traditional transosseous sutures (TS) in the repair of quadriceps tendon rupture (QTR). This study aimed to analyze and compare the functional outcomes of patients treated for quadriceps tendon ruptures using suture anchors or transosseous sutures. Patients having undergone suture anchor repair or transosseous suture repair for quadriceps tendon rupture between 2010 and 2015 at one of the two participating hospitals were included. Patients from site A underwent TS repair (TS group) while patients from site B underwent SA repair (SA group). Exclusion criteria included previous or concomitant injuries of the involved knee, penetrating injuries and pre-existing neurological conditions. Clinical outcome was assessed by subjective scores (Lysholm and Tegner Scores, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Score, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain), quadriceps isokinetic strength testing, Insall-Salvati Index (ISI), and physical examination. Non-parametrical statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; test. Twenty-seven patients were included in the study of which 17 patients (63%) were available for follow-up (SA group: 9, TS group: 8). All patients were male with a mean age of 62.7 (SD: 8.8) and 57.9 (SD: 12.7) years for the SA group and TS group, respectively. The groups did not differ in terms of demographic characteristics. No clinically significant differences were identified between the two groups. There were no re-ruptures in either group. Treatment of quadriceps tendon rupture using suture anchors provides a clinically valid alternative treatment to the gold-standard transosseous suture repair.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194376</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194376</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Clinical outcomes after treatment of quadriceps tendon ruptures show equal results independent of suture anchor or transosseus repair technique used – A pilot study</title><fingerprint>b2619fa</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Plesser, Mohammad Keilani, Gyoergy Vekszler, Timothy Hasenoehrl, Stefano Palma, Martin Reschl, Richard Crevenna, Stefan Hajdu, Harald Kurt Widhalm&lt;/p&gt;

Natural reservoirs of &lt;i&gt;Yersinia (Y&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; comprise different animal species, but little is known about the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of yersiniosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; among game animals in Poland. The bio-serotypes and the pathogenicity markers of the analyzed isolates were determined. The experimental material comprised rectal swabs from 857 free-living animals hunter-harvested over a period of 2 years (2013–2014) in hunting districts across Poland. The isolates from bacteriological studies were confirmed by PCR and bio-serotyped based on the results of biochemical and agglutination tests. In the group of the 218 analyzed isolates of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, 133 were derived from wild boars, 70 from red deer, 11 from roe deer and 4 from fallow deer, and they accounted for 61.0%, 32.1%, 5.1% and 1.8% of all isolates, respectively. Bio-serotyping assays revealed that 91.7% of the examined isolates belonged to biotype 1A (200/218). The remaining 18 isolates belonged to bio-serotypes 1B/NI (3/218, 1.4%), 1B/O:8 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/NI (6/218, 2.8%), 2/O:27 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:9 (2/218, 0.9%), 3/NI (2/218, 0.9%), 4/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%) and 4/O:9 (1/218, 0.5%). The &lt;i&gt;ail&lt;/i&gt; gene, a suggestive virulence gene for &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, has been found in 30 isolates from 20 wild boars, in 6 isolates from red deer, and in 1 isolate from roe deer.

Our study demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; is frequently isolated from game animals in Poland, which poses a risk of spreading these infectious agents to other animal species and humans.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195136</canonicalUrl><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde20:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195319</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Franca Ogechi Iheonu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Franca Ogechi Iheonu, Iretiola Bamikeolu Fajolu, Chinyere Veronica Ezeaka, Wellington Aghoghovwia Oyibo&lt;/p&gt;
Background and objectives &lt;p&gt;Sick neonates in malaria endemic areas are frequently transfused with donor blood unscreened for malaria parasite. Consequently, they are at risk of transfusional malaria which can lead to increased neonatal mortality. The study aimed to determine the burden of transfusional malaria in neonates to help in policy formulation on prevention of transfusional malaria.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;One hundred and sixty four neonates admitted into the neonatal unit of a tertiary hospital over a 10 month period who were scheduled for blood transfusion were screened for malaria parasites pre-transfusion, at three and 14 days post transfusion using Giemsa stained thick and thin films. Donor blood was screened for malaria parasites at the point of transfusion. Neonates who developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion were followed up for signs of malaria.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All recruited neonates tested negative to malaria parasite pre- transfusion. One hundred and twenty (73.2%) were term neonates with 94(57.3%) aged 1-7days. Four (2.4%) neonates developed malaria parasitaemia three days post transfusion and all four developed fever that resolved on treatment for malaria. Three (1.8%) of 164 donor blood samples had malaria parasitaemia and all three (100%) neonates who were transfused with the infected donor blood developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion. However, one neonate who developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion was transfused with non-infected donor blood.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of transfusional malaria in this study is low (2.4%). However, 100% of neonates who received malaria infected donor blood developed transfusional malaria. We therefore recommend routine screening of donor pre-transfusion, testing of neonates who develop fever post transfusion and treatment of those who test positive to malaria.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195319</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195319</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>Transfusional malaria in the neonatal period in Lagos, South-West Nigeria</title><fingerprint>1e1a6092</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Franca Ogechi Iheonu, Iretiola Bamikeolu Fajolu, Chinyere Veronica Ezeaka, Wellington Aghoghovwia Oyibo&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding determinants shaping infection risk of endangered wildlife is a major topic in conservation medicine. The proboscis monkey, &lt;i&gt;Nasalis larvatus&lt;/i&gt;, an endemic primate flagship species for conservation in Borneo, is endangered through habitat loss, but can still be found in riparian lowland and mangrove forests, and in some protected areas. To assess socioecological and anthropogenic influence on intestinal helminth infections in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;larvatus&lt;/i&gt;, 724 fecal samples of harem and bachelor groups, varying in size and the number of juveniles, were collected between June and October 2012 from two study sites in Malaysian Borneo: 634 samples were obtained from groups inhabiting the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS), 90 samples were collected from groups of the Labuk Bay Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary (LBPMS), where monkeys are fed on stationary feeding platforms. Parasite risk was quantified by intestinal helminth prevalence, host parasite species richness (PSR), and eggs per gram feces (epg). Generalized linear mixed effect models were applied to explore whether study site, group type, group size, the number of juveniles per group, and sampling month predict parasite risk. At the LBPMS, prevalence and epg of &lt;i&gt;Trichuris&lt;/i&gt; spp., strongylids, and &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp. but not &lt;i&gt;Ascaris&lt;/i&gt; spp., as well as host PSR were significantly elevated. Only for &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp., prevalence showed significant changes between months; at both sites, the beginning rainy season with increased precipitation was linked to higher prevalence, suggesting the external life cycle of &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp. to benefit from humidity. Higher prevalence, epgs, and PSR within the LBPMS suggest that anthropogenic factors shape host infection risk more than socioecological factors, most likely via higher re-infection rates and chronic stress. Noninvasive measurement of fecal parasite stages is an important tool for assessing transmission dynamics and infection risks for endangered tropical wildlife. Findings will contribute to healthcare management in nature and in anthropogenically managed environments.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195584</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195584</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>Fecal parasite risk in the endangered proboscis monkey is higher in an anthropogenically managed forest environment compared to a riparian rain forest in Sabah, Borneo</title><fingerprint>d13e25d3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Annette Klaus, Christina Strube, Kathrin Monika Röper, Ute Radespiel, Frank Schaarschmidt, Senthilvel Nathan, Benoit Goossens, Elke Zimmermann&lt;/p&gt;

There is a marked comorbidity between alcohol abuse and eating disorders, especially in the young population. We have previously reported that bingeing on fat during adolescence increases the rewarding effects of ethanol (EtOH). The aim of the present work was to study if vulnerability to EtOH persists after cessation of binge eating. OF1 mice binged on fat (HFB: high-fat binge) during adolescence (PND 25–43) and were tested for 15 days after the last access to HFB (on PND 59) using the self-administration paradigm, the conditioned place preference (CPP) and locomotor sensitization to ethanol. Our results showed that after 15 days of cessation of fat ingestion, mice increased their consumption of ethanol and showed greater motivation to obtain ethanol. On the other hand, no effects were observed in the CPP, while an increased locomotor response to ethanol was detected. The present results confirm and extend our previous study demonstrating that the compulsive intake of fat induces long-lasting effects on the reward system that lead to an increased consumption of EtOH.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194431</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194431</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Increased ethanol consumption after interruption of fat bingeing</title><fingerprint>9984bae5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by M.

These data are more valuable in aggregate: joint analysis of genomes from many sources increases sample size and statistical power for trait mapping, and will enable studies of genome biology, population genetics and genome function at unprecedented scale. A central challenge for joint analysis is that different WGS data processing and analysis pipelines cause substantial batch effects in combined datasets, necessitating computationally expensive reprocessing and harmonization prior to variant calling. This approach is no longer tenable given the scale of current studies and data volumes. Here, in a collaboration across multiple genome centers and NIH programs, we define WGS data processing standards that allow different groups to produce &amp;quot;functionally equivalent&amp;quot; (FE) results suitable for joint variant calling with minimal batch effects. Our approach promotes broad harmonization of upstream data processing steps, while allowing for diverse variant callers. Importantly, it allows each group to continue innovating on data processing pipelines, as long as results remain compatible. We present initial FE pipelines developed at five genome centers and show that they yield similar variant calling results -- including single nucleotide (SNV), insertion/deletion (indel) and structural variation (SV) -- and produce significantly less variability than sequencing replicates. Residual inter-pipeline variability is concentrated at low quality sites and repetitive genomic regions prone to stochastic effects.

Based on extensive Langevin Dynamics simulations we investigate the structural properties of a two-dimensional ensemble of magnetic rods with a peapod-like morphology, i.e, rods consisting of aligned single dipolar beads. Self-assembled configurations are studied for different directions of the dipole with respect to the rod axis. We found that with increasing misalignment of the dipole from the rod axis, the smaller the packing fraction at which the percolation transition is found. For the same density, the system exhibits different aggregation states for different misalignment. We also study the stability of the percolated structures with respect to temperature, which is found to be affected by the microstructure of the assembly of rods.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195552</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195552</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>Self-assembly and clustering of magnetic peapod-like rods with tunable directional interaction</title><fingerprint>1b624c1d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jorge L.

Background &lt;p&gt;This is the first report to characterize the prevalence and genovar distribution of genital chlamydial infections among random heterosexual patients in the multi-ethnic Saratov Region, located in Southeast Russia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sixty-one clinical samples (cervical or urethral swabs) collected from a random cohort of 856 patients (7.1%) were &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT) positive in commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and duplex TaqMan PCRs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Sequence analysis of the VDII region of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene revealed seven genovars of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; in PCR-positive patients. The overall genovars were distributed as E (41.9%), G (21.6%), F (13.5%), K (9.5%), D (6.8%), J (4.1%), and H (2.7%). CT-positive samples were from males (n = 12, 19.7%), females (n = 42, 68.8%), and anonymous (n = 7, 11.5%) patients, with an age range of 19 to 45 years (average 26.4), including 12 different ethnic groups representative of this region. Most patients were infected with a single genovar (82%), while 18% were co-infected with either two or three genovars. The 1156 bp-fragment of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene was sequenced in 46 samples to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among isolates. SNP-based subtyping and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the presence of 13 variants of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene, such as E (E1, E2, E6), G (G1, G2, G3, G5), F1, K, D (D1, Da2), J1, and H2. Differing genovar distribution was identified among urban (E&gt;G&gt;F) and rural (E&gt;K) populations, and in Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;D) and non-Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;K) ethnic groups. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) determined five sequences types (STs), such as ST4 (56%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 70.0 to 41.3), ST6 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3), ST9 (22%, 95% CI 35.9 to 11.5), ST10 (2%, 95% CI 10.7 to 0.05) and ST38 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3).

Sea turtles are distributed in tropical and subtropical seas worldwide. They play several ecological roles and are considered important indicators of the health of marine ecosystems. Studying epibiotic diatoms living on turtle shells suggestively has great potential in the study of turtle behavior because diatoms are always there. However, diatom identification at the species level is time consuming, requires well-trained specialists, and there is a high probability of finding new taxa growing on turtle shells, which makes identification tricky. An alternative approach based on DNA barcoding and high throughput sequencing (HTS), metabarcoding, has been developed in recent years to identify species at the community level by using a DNA reference library. The suitabilities of morphological and molecular approaches were compared. Diatom assemblages were sampled from seven juvenile green turtles (&lt;i&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/i&gt;) from Mayotte Island, France. The structures of the epibiotic diatom assemblages differed between both approaches. This resulted in different clustering of the turtles based on their diatom communities. Metabarcoding allowed better discrimination between turtles based on their epibiotic diatom assemblages and put into evidence the presence of a cryptic diatom diversity. Microscopy, for its part, provided more ecological information of sea turtles based on historical bibliographical data and the abundances of ecological guilds of the diatom species present in the samples. This study shows the complementary nature of these two methods for studying turtle behavior.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195770</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195770</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>DNA metabarcoding and microscopic analyses of sea turtles biofilms: Complementary to understand turtle behavior</title><fingerprint>5f2ddbf7</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sinziana F.

The waste of commonly used medicines is known to contaminate freshwater ecosystems. Pharmaceuticals can be toxic, mutagenic, or modifying to freshwater organisms even at low concentrations if consider their permanent presence in the environment. Chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer, and in particular alkylating agents, contribute significantly to this form of pollution, the latter introducing cytotoxic and/or mutagenic lesions to the DNA and RNA of organisms which can be disruptive to their cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide (CP) on &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt; clones. We evaluated the life history parameters and protein profiles of this crustacean following exposure to environmentally relevant CP concentration of 10 ng L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Even at this low concentration, the alkylating agent caused modification of the life history parameters and proteome profile of the &lt;i&gt;Daphnia&lt;/i&gt;. These changes were clone-specific and involved growth rate, age at first reproduction, neonate number, and proteins related to cell cycle and redox state regulation. The disturbance caused by pharmaceuticals contaminating freshwater ecosystem is probably weaker and unlikely to be cytotoxic in character due to the high dilution of these substances in the water. However, our results indicate that prolonged exposure of organisms to these toxins may lead to modifications on the organismal and molecular levels with unpredictable significance for the entire ecosystem.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195366</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195366</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>How cyclophosphamide at environmentally relevant concentration influences &amp;lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&amp;lt;/i&gt; life history and its proteome</title><fingerprint>d431fe05</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Grzesiuk, Damian Mielecki, Tomasz Pilżys, Damian Garbicz, Michał Marcinkowski, Elżbieta Grzesiuk&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of anaphylaxis-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the first step toward developing preventative strategies and optimizing care systems. We aimed to describe and compare epidemiological features and clinical outcomes among patients with anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs according to causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified emergency medical service (EMS)-treated anaphylaxis-associated OHCA patients from a nationwide OHCA registry between 2008 and 2015. We compared epidemiological characteristics and outcomes according to causal agents (a natural agents group and an iatrogenic agents group) and evaluated temporal variability in incidence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare survival to discharge between causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the study period (8 years), the total number of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs was 233. A total of 224 eligible cases were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients (85.6%) in the natural agents group and 32 patients (14.3%) in the iatrogenic agents group. There was significant diurnal and seasonal variability in the frequency of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values&amp;lt;0.01 for both), with the highest incidences occurring during the day (7:01 am to 3 pm; 64.6%) and in summer (June to August, 48.7%). Compared with the natural agents group, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for survival to discharge in the iatrogenic agents group was statistically insignificant (AOR 3.61, 95% CI 0.86 to 15.06).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is considerably low, and significant temporal variability, with a peak during the day and in summer, is evident. Anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is more common by natural agents than by iatrogenic agents, but no difference in the survival-to-discharge rate is evident.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194921</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194921</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>Epidemiology and outcomes of anaphylaxis-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest</title><fingerprint>b4fda32</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sun Young Lee, Seung Chul Lee, Sang Do Shin, Kyoung Jun Song, Young Sun Ro, Jeong Ho Park, So Yeon Kong&lt;/p&gt;

The present study aimed to explore how state self-control influences the intertemporal decisions made by individuals with high and low trait self-control. State self-control, represented by the degree of depletion, was manipulated by conducting Stroop tasks with different levels of difficulty, and the intertemporal decision task was used as a self-control task. Compared with participants with high trait self-control, the preferences of participants with low trait self-control for immediate rewards were more vulnerable to the difficulty of depletion tasks. Throughout the experimental stages, the heart rate variability (HRV) of participants with high trait self-control was significantly higher than that of participants with low trait self-control, indicating that individuals with high trait self-control may have stronger and more stable self-control abilities.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195333</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195333</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>The effect of state self-control on the intertemporal decisions made by individuals with high and low trait self-control</title><fingerprint>a0e64413</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Guan, Jiamei He&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the photochemical degradation of trypan blue (TB) and to identify decomposition products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Defined solution samples of TB and a mixture with lutein/zeaxanthin were exposed to blue light. Thermal degradation processes were ruled out using controls not subjected to irradiation. All samples were analyzed using optical microscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Degradation kinetics were determined based on changes in absorbance; intermediates were identified by analyzing mass differences of characteristic fragment ion peaks within the fragmentation patterns, and assignments were verified by NMR.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photochemical degradation, which can be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin. Intermediates vary depending on the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin. The self-sensitized photodegradation of TB occurs under generation of dimethyl sulfate and presumed formation of phenol. In contrast, within the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin the decomposition of TB indicates the formation of methoxyamine and sulfonyl arin. Thermal degradation processes were not observed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photodegradation that may be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin and results in the formation of cytotoxic decomposition products. Our findings contribute to understand degradation mechanisms of TB and may elucidate previous clinical and experimental observations of cellular toxicity after TB application.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195849</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195849</link><published>1523394000000</published><title>Photochemical degradation of trypan blue</title><fingerprint>711b2088</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias Brockmann, Véronique Blanchard, Philipp Heretsch, Claudia Brockmann, Eckart Bertelmann&lt;/p&gt;

Vasculature is an interface between the circulation and the hematopoietic tissue providing the means for hundreds of billions of blood cells to enter the circulation every day in a regulated fashion. The precise mechanisms that control the interactions of hematopoietic cells with the vessel wall are largely undefined. Here, we report on the development of an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; 3D human marrow vascular microenvironment (VME) to study hematopoietic trafficking and the release of blood cells, specifically platelets. We show that mature megakaryocytes from aspirated marrow as well as megakaryocytes differentiated in culture from CD34+ cells can be embedded in a collagen matrix containing engineered microvessels to create a thrombopoietic VME. These megakaryocytes continue to mature, penetrate the vessel wall, and release platelets into the vessel lumen. This process can be blocked with the addition of antibodies specific for CXCR4, indicating that CXCR4 is required for megakaryocyte migration, though whether it is sufficient is unclear. The 3D marrow VME system shows considerable potential for mechanistic studies defining the role of marrow vasculature in thrombopoiesis. Through a stepwise addition or removal of individual marrow components, this model provides potential to define key pathways responsible for the release of platelets and other blood cells.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195082</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195082</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>Microvasculature-directed thrombopoiesis in a 3D &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; marrow microenvironment</title><fingerprint>aabb7852</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Surya Kotha, Sijie Sun, Amie Adams, Brian Hayes, Kiet T.

Pooled DNA from multiple unknown organisms arises in a variety of contexts, for example microbial samples from ecological or human health research. Determining the composition of pooled samples can be difficult, especially at the scale of modern sequencing data and reference databases. Here we propose a novel method for taxonomic profiling in pooled DNA that combines the speed and low-memory requirements of k-mer based pseudoalignment with a likelihood framework that uses base quality information to better resolve multiply mapped reads. We apply the method to the problem of classifying 16S rRNA reads using a reference database of known organisms, a common challenge in microbiome research. Using simulations, we show the method is accurate across a variety of read lengths, with different length reference sequences, at different sample depths, and when samples contain reads originating from organisms absent from the reference. We also assess performance in real 16S data, where we reanalyze previous genetic association data to show our method discovers a larger number of quantitative trait associations than other widely used methods. We implement our method in the software Karp, for k-mer based analysis of read pools, to provide a novel combination of speed and accuracy that is uniquely suited for enhancing discoveries in microbial studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3dI4mAo5X0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d2:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mark Reppell, John Novembre&lt;/p&gt;

Using simulations, we show the method is accurate across a variety of read lengths, with different length reference sequences, at different sample depths, and when samples contain reads originating from organisms absent from the reference. We also assess performance in real 16S data, where we reanalyze previous genetic association data to show our method discovers a larger number of quantitative trait associations than other widely used methods. We implement our method in the software Karp, for k-mer based analysis of read pools, to provide a novel combination of speed and accuracy that is uniquely suited for enhancing discoveries in microbial studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3dI4mAo5X0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523900893385</crawled><unread>True</unread><recrawled>1523911321731</recrawled></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3788.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Quentin Bernard, Alexis A.

Evidence from literature is mixed regarding a possible association of maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and overweight in the offspring. Sexual dimorphism, or sex disparities in the pathogenesis linking GDM exposure to overweight, could be at play. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between GDM and child overweight at 5–7 years. Six hundred pairs (1:1) of Reunionese liveborn singletons selected from a hospital-based birth registry, matched for sex, gestational age, and birth period, underwent a prospective in-home follow-up and were analyzed with respect to their exposure to GDM. The primary outcome was child overweight at 5–7 years, as defined by the International Obesity Task Force. The association between GDM exposure and child overweight was estimated by the odds ratio (OR) using conditional logistic regression models. For the subset of children exposed to GDM with available maternal glycemic data, we analyzed the relationship between maternal glycemic levels during pregnancy and child body mass index (BMI) at 5–7 years with a linear regression model. In light of the significant interaction between sex and GDM, all statistical analyses were then stratified by sex. After controlling for pre-pregnancy BMI and maternal sociodemographic characteristics, the risk of overweight increased with exposure to GDM for boys (adjusted OR: 2.34; 95% confidence interval = 1.26–4.34, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) but not for girls (adjusted OR: 0.56; 95%CI = 0.28–1.10, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.093). Consistent with this, the linear increase of boys’ BMI at 5–7 years with maternal blood glucose levels during pregnancy, in the exposed group, displayed a dose-response relationship. Our findings indicate that exposure to GDM is a risk factor for childhood overweight in boys but not in girls, which adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting greater sensitivity of male offspring to intrauterine hyperglycemia.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195531</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195531</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Sexual dimorphism in the association between gestational diabetes mellitus and overweight in offspring at 5-7 years: The OBEGEST cohort study</title><fingerprint>5047ace4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nathalie Le Moullec, Adrian Fianu, Olivier Maillard, Emilie Chazelle, Nadège Naty, Chantal Schneebeli, Patrick Gérardin, Laetitia Huiart, Marie-Aline Charles, François Favier&lt;/p&gt;

Six hundred pairs (1:1) of Reunionese liveborn singletons selected from a hospital-based birth registry, matched for sex, gestational age, and birth period, underwent a prospective in-home follow-up and were analyzed with respect to their exposure to GDM. The primary outcome was child overweight at 5–7 years, as defined by the International Obesity Task Force. The association between GDM exposure and child overweight was estimated by the odds ratio (OR) using conditional logistic regression models. For the subset of children exposed to GDM with available maternal glycemic data, we analyzed the relationship between maternal glycemic levels during pregnancy and child body mass index (BMI) at 5–7 years with a linear regression model. In light of the significant interaction between sex and GDM, all statistical analyses were then stratified by sex. After controlling for pre-pregnancy BMI and maternal sociodemographic characteristics, the risk of overweight increased with exposure to GDM for boys (adjusted OR: 2.34; 95% confidence interval = 1.26–4.34, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) but not for girls (adjusted OR: 0.56; 95%CI = 0.28–1.10, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.093). Consistent with this, the linear increase of boys’ BMI at 5–7 years with maternal blood glucose levels during pregnancy, in the exposed group, displayed a dose-response relationship. Our findings indicate that exposure to GDM is a risk factor for childhood overweight in boys but not in girls, which adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting greater sensitivity of male offspring to intrauterine hyperglycemia.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195531</canonicalUrl><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3735.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Jennifer Viegas</name></author><description>Field studies in Africa over the past four decades by ethologists Dorothy Cheney and Robert Seyfarth have uncovered a trove of insights into the behavior, communication, and social cognition of nonhuman primates.

Along with the rapid development of Intelligent Transportation Systems, traffic data collection technologies have progressed fast. The emergence of innovative data collection technologies such as remote traffic microwave sensor, Bluetooth sensor, GPS-based floating car method, and automated license plate recognition, has significantly increased the variety and volume of traffic data. Despite the development of these technologies, the missing data issue is still a problem that poses great challenge for data based applications such as traffic forecasting, real-time incident detection, dynamic route guidance, and massive evacuation optimization. A thorough literature review suggests most current imputation models either focus on the temporal nature of the traffic data and fail to consider the spatial information of neighboring locations or assume the data follow a certain distribution. These two issues reduce the imputation accuracy and limit the use of the corresponding imputation methods respectively. As a result, this paper presents a Kriging based data imputation approach that is able to fully utilize the spatiotemporal correlation in the traffic data and that does not assume the data follow any distribution. A set of scenarios with different missing rates are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of two other widely used methods, historical average and K-nearest neighborhood. Comparison results indicate that the proposed method has the highest imputation accuracy and is more flexible compared to other methods.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195957</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195957</link><published>1523998800000</published><title>A Kriging based spatiotemporal approach for traffic volume data imputation</title><fingerprint>1f5c87d9</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hongtai Yang, Jianjiang Yang, Lee D.

Despite this, transcriptomic analyses of the human brain have typically been conducted using macro-dissected tissue due to the difficulty of performing single-cell type analyses with donated post-mortem brains. To address this issue statistically, we compiled a database of several thousand transcripts that were specifically-enriched in one of 10 primary cortical cell types in previous publications. Using this database, we predicted the relative cell type composition for 833 human cortical samples using microarray or RNA-Seq data from the Pritzker Consortium (GSE92538) or publicly-available databases (GSE53987, GSE21935, GSE21138, CommonMind Consortium). These predictions were generated by averaging normalized expression levels across transcripts specific to each cell type using our R-package BrainInABlender (validated and publicly-released: https://github.com/hagenaue/BrainInABlender). Using this method, we found that the principal components of variation in the datasets strongly correlated with the neuron to glia ratio of the samples. This variability was not simply due to dissection - the relative balance of brain cell types appeared to be influenced by a variety of demographic, pre- and post-mortem variables. Prolonged hypoxia around the time of death predicted increased astrocytic and endothelial gene expression, illustrating vascular upregulation. Aging was associated with decreased neuronal gene expression. Red blood cell gene expression was reduced in individuals who died following systemic blood loss. Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder had decreased astrocytic gene expression, mirroring previous morphometric observations. Subjects with Schizophrenia had reduced red blood cell gene expression, resembling the hypofrontality detected in fMRI experiments. Finally, in datasets containing samples with especially variable cell content, we found that controlling for predicted sample cell content while evaluating differential expression improved the detection of previously-identified psychiatric effects. We conclude that accounting for cell type can greatly improve the interpretability of transcriptomic data.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/089391v3?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/089391v3?rss=1</link><published>1522306800000</published><title>INFERENCE OF CELL TYPE COMPOSITION FROM HUMAN BRAIN TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATASETS ILLUMINATES THE EFFECTS OF AGE, MANNER OF DEATH, DISSECTION, AND PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>5ebeffe6</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Psychiatric illness is unlikely to arise from pathology occurring uniformly across all cell types in affected brain regions.

Background &lt;p&gt;Many mathematical models have investigated the population-level impact of expanding antiretroviral therapy (ART), using different assumptions about HIV disease progression on ART and among ART dropouts. We evaluated the influence of these assumptions on model projections of the number of infections and deaths prevented by expanded ART.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A new dynamic model of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) was developed, which incorporated each of four alternative assumptions about disease progression used in previous models: (A) ART slows disease progression; (B) ART halts disease progression; (C) ART reverses disease progression by increasing CD4 count; (D) ART reverses disease progression, but disease progresses rapidly once treatment is stopped. The model was independently calibrated to HIV prevalence and ART coverage data from the United States under each progression assumption in turn. New HIV infections and HIV-related deaths averted over 10 years were compared for fixed ART coverage increases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Little absolute difference (&amp;lt;7 percentage points (pp)) in HIV infections averted over 10 years was seen between progression assumptions for the same increases in ART coverage (varied between 33% and 90%) if ART dropouts reinitiated ART at the same rate as ART-naïve MSM. Larger differences in the predicted fraction of HIV-related deaths averted were observed (up to 15pp). However, if ART dropouts could only reinitiate ART at CD4&amp;lt;200 cells/μl, assumption C predicted substantially larger fractions of HIV infections and deaths averted than other assumptions (up to 20pp and 37pp larger, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Different disease progression assumptions on and post-ART interruption did not affect the fraction of HIV infections averted with expanded ART, unless ART dropouts only re-initiated ART at low CD4 counts.

Given a selection of older papers from the journal that readers were unfamiliar with, could they pick out the ones that ended up getting cited more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this work, revised and expanded, is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194903&quot;&gt;subject of a paper&lt;/a&gt; in PLOS ONE (open access, by definition), and the author line features some blog pseudonyms, interestingly. A 2003 issue of JACS was selected, and respondents were asked the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers in the issue to you think are the most ‘significant’ (your own definition of ‘significant’ is what is important here)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without looking up numbers, which three papers do you think will have been cited the most to-date?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you most want to point out to other chemists?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you want to shout about from the rooftops (i.e., tell anybody about, not just chemists)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad to say that I seem to have skewed the set of responders a bit, since it appears that many of the people who answered the survey were readers of this blog following a link. Looking over the papers that were suggested, it seems that the correlation between the first set and the third (significant, and should be shared with other chemists) was pretty strong, as you might think, but that correlation between “significant” and “will have been cited the most” was somewhat weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the correlation between what respondents thought would be the most cited articles and the actual ten-years-later citation counts was quite poor (see the paper’s Figure 1). Looking at Figure 2, you can see that none of the other questions, in fact, correlate well with the real citation counts (I would be rather unhappy if these graphs represented project assay correlations!) Of course, it’s also true that the respondents disagreed pretty significantly about which papers were significant in the first place. That’s strong evidence that the survey set was indeed composed of practicing chemists, because we rarely agree on much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there indeed differences between “interesting, thought-provoking” papers and ones that you feel like telling other chemists about? Or between those and the ones that pick up citations? These data, though far from comprehensive, suggest that both of these may be true (as does ones own intuition, for what that’s worth). The paper tries to correlate responses to the reported areas of specialization of the responders, and there may well be something to that. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja034820y&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was cited 325 times over the next ten years, but only five responders to the survey picked it as one that would get cited. All five of them, though, indicated that they specialized in this general area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja0345423&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was selected by many survey responders as one that would pick up citations, but its actual ten-year citation count was average-to-modest. My own guess here (I may have picked this one myself!) was that the title sounded like something “hot”, by current standards, and it surely would have been picked up on. But that shows you the peril of such gut feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this does is drive yet another nail into the idea that current publication-based measures to evaluate research importance, quality, and impact are much good at all. They aren’t. The paper finishes up on just this point, referencing several other initiatives that are trying to overturn citation counts, h-indices, journal impact factors and so on. These things are measures, sure enough, but they’re not necessarily measuring very much, and not necessarily what some of their users think that they’re measuring!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>The Scientific Literature</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162775a21f0:7b37a95:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522420818416</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/30/which-will-sprout-and-which-will-bear-fruit</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3108.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Vikas Yadav, Sheng Sun, R.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn these cis-regulatory grammars encoded in regulatory DNA sequences associated with transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility. Several feature attribution methods have been developed for estimating the predictive importance of individual features (nucleotides or motifs) in any input DNA sequence to its associated output prediction from a DNN model. However, these methods do not reveal higher-order, epistatic feature interactions encoded by the models. We present a new method called Deep Feature Interaction Maps (DFIM) to efficiently estimate interactions between all pairs of features in any input DNA sequence. DFIM accurately identifies ground truth motif interactions embedded in simulated regulatory DNA sequences. DFIM identifies synergistic interactions between GATA1 and TAL1 motifs from in vivo TF binding models. DFIM reveals epistatic interactions involving nucleotides flanking the core motif of the Cbf1 TF in yeast from in vitro TF binding models. We also apply DFIM to regulatory sequence models of in vivo chromatin accessibility to reveal interactions between regulatory genetic variants and proximal motifs of target TFs as validated by TF binding quantitative trait loci. Our approach makes significant strides in improving the interpretability of deep learning models for genomics.</description><engagement>3</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302711v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302711v1?rss=1</link><published>1523948400000</published><title>Discovering epistatic feature interactions from neural network models of regulatory DNA sequences [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>ea0f1259</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Transcription factors bind complex regulatory DNA sequence patterns in a combinatorial manner to modulate gene expression.

DFIM accurately identifies ground truth motif interactions embedded in simulated regulatory DNA sequences. DFIM identifies synergistic interactions between GATA1 and TAL1 motifs from in vivo TF binding models. DFIM reveals epistatic interactions involving nucleotides flanking the core motif of the Cbf1 TF in yeast from in vitro TF binding models. We also apply DFIM to regulatory sequence models of in vivo chromatin accessibility to reveal interactions between regulatory genetic variants and proximal motifs of target TFs as validated by TF binding quantitative trait loci. Our approach makes significant strides in improving the interpretability of deep learning models for genomics.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/17/302711</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162d3dd9fee:31bacbc:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523972939758</crawled><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>3.0</engagementRate></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03970-x</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Olivier Borkowski</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cell-free prediction of protein expression costs for growing cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell-free prediction of protein expression costs for growing cells, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03970-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03970-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The translation of heterologous proteins places a burden on host cell resources, affecting growth and productivity.

Depression is a common issue in institutionalized elderly people. The “Attentively Embracing Story” theory is applied to help individuals transform negative thoughts into positive, and reflect on spiritual healing. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a “Story-Centred Care Intervention Program” based on the “Attentively Embracing Story” theory in improving depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and heart rate variability in institutionalized elderly people. Seventy long-term care residents were recruited from two long-term care facilities and randomized into the story-centred care intervention (n = 35) and control groups (n = 35). We excluded five long-term care residents who did not complete the post-test measures and five long-term care residents who had interference events on the outcome measures. Finally, sixty long-term care residents (40 women and 20 men; age 84.3±5.98 years) were included in the final analysis. Data were collected at four times (pre-intervention and post-intervention, 1 and 3-month follow-up) and analyzed with the generalized estimating equation approach.Instruments, including Geriatric Depression Scale, Short Portable Mind Status Questionnaire, and a CheckMyHeart device to measure heart rate variability, were used in study. The degree of improvement in depressive symptoms was significantly higher in the story-centred care intervention group than in the control group after providing the story-centred care intervention program (p &amp;lt; .001) and at 1 and 3-month follow-up (p = .001, p = .006, respectively; GDS-15 score reduced 1.816 at the 3-month follow-up). Participants receiving the story-centred care intervention program showed significantly greater improvement than those in the control group in the cognitive function at 1and 3-month follow-up (p = .009, p = .024, respectively; SPMSQ score reduced 0.345 at the 3-month follow-up). The heart rate variability parameters (SDNN, RMSSD) did not show a statistically significant increase. However an increasing trend in the parameters was observed in the intervention group (SDNN increased 16.235ms at the 3-month follow-up; RMSSD increased 16.424 ms at the 3-month follow-up). In conclusions, the story-centred care intervention program was effective on the improvement of depressive symptoms and cognitive status in institutionalized elderly people.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194178</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194178</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Effectiveness of Story-Centred Care Intervention Program in older persons living in long-term care facilities: A randomized, longitudinal study</title><fingerprint>b7db9068</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hui-Wan Chuang, Chi-Wen Kao, Ming-Der Lee, Yue-Cune Chang&lt;/p&gt;

Mice bearing carcinogen-induced premalignant oral lesions were previously shown to have a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which is replaced with an immune inhibitory phenotype as lesions progress to cancer. Since Th17 cells are prominent at the premalignant lesion state and their levels are supported by IL-23, studies used mice that were IL-23 receptor deficient (IL-23R KO) to determine the requirement for IL-23 signaling in the immunological and clinical status of mice with premalignant oral lesions. The results showed a dependence on IL-23 signaling for the pro-inflammatory state of mice with oral lesions as levels of IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-α were elevated in wildtype mice with premalignant oral lesions, but not in IL-23R KO mice. In contrast, as lesions progressed to cancer, the pro-inflammatory phenotype subsided and was replaced with the inhibitory mediator IL-10 and with Treg cells in wildtype mice, although not in IL-23R KO mice. Clinically, early progression of premalignant oral lesions to cancer was enhanced in IL-23R KO mice compared to progression in wildtype mice. These results show the importance of IL-23 signaling in both the pro-inflammatory phenotype characteristic of premalignant oral lesions and the inhibitory phenotype as lesions progress to cancer.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196034</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196034</link><published>1523998800000</published><title>Role of IL-23 signaling in the progression of premalignant oral lesions to cancer</title><fingerprint>c947de28</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Blaine Caughron, Yi Yang, M.

Insulin is a vital part of diabetes treatment, whereas glucagon is primarily used to treat insulin-induced hypoglycemia. However, glucagon is suggested to have a central role in the regulation of body weight, which would be beneficial for diabetic patients. Since the glucagon effect on blood glucose is known to be transient, it is relevant to investigate the pharmacodynamics of glucagon after repeated dosing. In the present study, we used telemetry to continuously measure blood glucose in streptozotocin induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats. This allowed for a more detailed analysis of glucose regulation compared to intermittent blood sampling. In particular, we evaluated the blood glucose-lowering effect of different insulin doses alone, and in combination with a long acting glucagon analog (LAG). We showed how the effect of the LAG accumulated and persisted over time. Furthermore, we found that addition of the LAG decreased body weight without affecting food intake.
In a subsequent study, we focused on the glucagon effect on body weight and food intake during equal glycemic control. In order to obtain comparable maximum blood glucose lowering effect to insulin alone, the insulin dose had to be increased four times in combination with 1 nmol/kg of the LAG. In this set-up the LAG prevented further increase in body weight despite the four times higher insulin-dose. However, the body composition was changed. The insulin group increased both lean and fat mass, whereas the group receiving four times insulin in combination with the LAG only significantly increased the fat mass. No differences were observed in food intake, suggesting a direct effect on energy expenditure by glucagon. Surprisingly, we observed decreased levels of FGF21 in plasma compared to insulin treatment alone. With the combination of insulin and the LAG the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin was prolonged, which could potentially be beneficial in diabetes treatment.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194468</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194468</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>Sustained effect of glucagon on body weight and blood glucose: Assessed by continuous glucose monitoring in diabetic rats</title><fingerprint>7444c4b7</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christina Pedersen, Trine Porsgaard, Maria Thomsen, Mette Marie Rosenkilde, Nikolaj Kulahin Roed&lt;/p&gt;

With the combination of insulin and the LAG the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin was prolonged, which could potentially be beneficial in diabetes treatment.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194468</canonicalUrl><updated>1521579600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37a9:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195976</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Mike Fleuren</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mike Fleuren, Elsa M.

A live-bearing reproductive strategy can induce large morphological changes in the mother during pregnancy. The evolution of the placenta in swimming animals involves a shift in the timing of maternal provisioning from pre-fertilization (females supply their eggs with sufficient yolk reserves prior to fertilization) to post-fertilization (females provide all nutrients via a placenta during the pregnancy). It has been hypothesised that this shift, associated with the evolution of the placenta, should confer a morphological advantage to the females leading to a more slender body shape during the early stages of pregnancy. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying three-dimensional shape and volume changes during pregnancy and in full-grown virgin controls of two species within the live-bearing fish family Poeciliidae: &lt;i&gt;Poeciliopsis gracilis&lt;/i&gt; (non-placental) and &lt;i&gt;Poeciliopsis turneri&lt;/i&gt; (placental). We show that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;turneri&lt;/i&gt; is more slender than &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gracilis&lt;/i&gt; at the beginning of the interbrood interval and in virgins, and that these differences diminish towards the end of pregnancy. This study provides the first evidence for an adaptive morphological advantage of the placenta in live-bearing fish. A similar morphological benefit could drive the evolution of placentas in other live-bearing (swimming) animal lineages.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195976</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195976</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>Why do placentas evolve?

Iron plays vital roles in the human body including enzymatic processes, oxygen-transport via hemoglobin and immune response. Iron metabolism is characterized by ~95% recycling and minor replenishment through diet. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a lack of synthesis of erythropoietin leading to reduced red blood cell (RBC) formation and aberrant iron recycling. Treatment of CKD anemia aims to normalize RBC count and serum hemoglobin. Clinically, the various fluxes of iron transport and accumulation are not measured so that changes during disease (e.g., CKD) and treatment are unknown. Unwanted iron accumulation in patients is known to lead to adverse effects. Current whole-body models lack the mechanistic details of iron transport related to RBC maturation, transferrin (Tf and TfR) dynamics and assume passive iron efflux from macrophages. Hence, they are not predictive of whole-body iron dynamics and cannot be used to design individualized patient treatment. For prediction, we developed a mechanistic, multi-scale computational model of whole-body iron metabolism incorporating four compartments containing major pools of iron and RBC generation process. The model accounts for multiple forms of iron &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, mechanisms involved in iron uptake and release and their regulation. Furthermore, the model is interfaced with drug pharmacokinetics to allow simulation of treatment dynamics. We calibrated our model with experimental and clinical data from peer-reviewed literature to reliably simulate CKD anemia and the effects of current treatment involving combination of epoietin-alpha and iron dextran. This &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; whole-body model of iron metabolism predicts that a year of treatment can potentially lead to 90% downregulation of ferroportin (FPN) levels, 15-fold increase in iron stores with only a 20% increase in iron flux from the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Model simulations quantified unmeasured iron fluxes, previously unknown effects of treatment on FPN-level and iron stores in the RES. This mechanistic whole-body model can be the basis for future studies that incorporate iron metabolism together with related clinical experiments. Such an approach could pave the way for development of effective personalized treatment of CKD anemia.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mfiym6I-5Rs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14cf:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joydeep Sarkar, Alka A.

Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) is a founding member of the conserved Puf domain class of RNA-binding translational regulators. Pum binds with high specificity, contacting eight nucleotides, one with each of the repeats in its RNA-binding domain. In general, Pum is thought to block translation in collaboration with Nanos (Nos), which exhibits no binding specificity in isolation but is recruited jointly to regulatory sequences containing a Pum binding site in the 3’-UTRs of target mRNAs. Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;hb&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described—repression of maternal &lt;i&gt;bicoid&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3’-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA or protein. Instead, we find that Pum and Nos control the accumulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in testes.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194865</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194865</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>No significant regulation of &amp;lt;i&gt;bicoid&amp;lt;/i&gt; mRNA by Pumilio or Nanos in the early &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila&amp;lt;/i&gt; embryo</title><fingerprint>cd12af8a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tammy H.

Simulation is regarded as an effective educational method for the delivery of clinical scenarios. However, exposure to unfamiliar environments during simulation can cause excessive stress among students, possibly leading to unnatural speech/behavior and poor skill learning (Yerkes-Dodson’s law). Thus, assessing students’ stress in a simulation can provide educators with a better understanding of their mental state. This study sought to clarify stress changes throughout the progression of the simulation by measuring heart rate variability and students’ subjective reactions in 74 nursing students. Heart rate variability was calculated in terms of its high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) components during 4 phases—the break, patient care, reporting, and debriefing. Students were interviewed about stress experienced during the simulation. The results showed that HF decreased significantly from the break to the patient care and reporting phases. Furthermore, LF/HF increased significantly from the break to the reporting phases. Approximately 55 students felt stressed during the simulation, 24 of whom felt most stressed during the reporting phase. Therefore, the reporting phase involved high objective and subjective stress. It may be possible that the educator’s evaluative attitude increased students’ stress. Therefore, a stress intervention during the reporting phase might further improve students’ performance during that phase. The debriefing phase did not significantly differ from the break phase for objective stress, and students did not report feeling stressed. Thus, in this phase, they were released from the stress of the reporting phase and the unfamiliar environment. During this phase, they might be able to learn what they could not understand owing to high stress in the patient care and reporting phases. This study provides objective and subjective evidence of students’ stress during simulation, and indicates the necessity of providing support during the reporting phase and the importance of debriefing when using clinical scenarios for teaching clinical skills.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195280</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195280</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Heart rate variability can clarify students’ level of stress during nursing simulation</title><fingerprint>22a1ebf2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Natsuki Nakayama, Naoko Arakawa, Harumi Ejiri, Reiko Matsuda, Tsuneko Makino&lt;/p&gt;

Due to the stochasticity of single-molecule blinking and the desire to improve SMLM&apos;s temporal resolution, algorithms capable of analyzing frames with a high density (HD) of active molecules, or molecules whose images overlap, are a prerequisite for accurate location measurements. Thus far, HD algorithms are evaluated using scalar metrics, such as root-mean-square error, that fail to quantify the structure of errors caused by the structure of the sample. Here, we show that the spatial distribution of localization errors within super-resolved images of biological structures are vectorial in nature, leading to systematic structural biases that severely degrade image resolution. We further demonstrate that the shape of the microscope&apos;s point-spread function (PSF) fundamentally affects the characteristics of imaging artifacts. We built a Robust Statistical Estimation algorithm (RoSE) to minimize these biases for arbitrary structures and PSFs. RoSE accomplishes this minimization by estimating the likelihood of blinking events to localize molecules more accurately and eliminate false localizations. Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293670v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293670v1?rss=1</link><published>1522738800000</published><title>Minimizing Structural Bias in Single-Molecule Super-Resolution Microscopy [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>2da0cb1a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) depends on sequential detection and localization of individual molecular blinking events.

Among those strategies, Type IV effectors (T4Es) are proteins secreted by pathogenic bacteria to manipulate host cell processes during infection. They are delivered into eukaryotic cells in an ATP-dependent manner via the type IV secretion system, a specialized multiprotein complex. T4Es contain a wide spectrum of features including eukaryotic-like domains, localization signals or a C-terminal translocation signal. A combination of these features enables prediction of T4Es in a given bacterial genome. In this study, we developed a web-based comprehensive suite of tools with a user-friendly graphical interface. This version 2.0 of S4TE (Searching Algorithm for Type IV Effector Proteins; http://sate.cirad.fr) enables accurate prediction and comparison of T4Es. Search parameters and threshold can be customized by the user to work with any genome sequence, whether publicly available or not. Applications range from characterizing effector features and identifying potential T4Es to analyzing the effectors based on the genome G+C composition and local gene density. S4TE 2.0 allows the comparison of putative T4E repertoires of up to four bacterial strains at the same time. The software identifies T4E orthologs among strains and provides a Venn diagram and lists of genes for each intersection. New interactive features offer the best visualization of the location of candidate T4Es and hyperlinks to NCBI and Pfam databases. S4TE 2.0 is designed to evolve rapidly with the publication of new experimentally validated T4Es, which will reinforce the predictive power of the algorithm. The computational methodology can be used to identify a wide spectrum of candidate bacterial effectors that lack sequence conservation but have similar amino acid characteristics. This approach will provide very valuable information about bacterial host-specificity and virulence factors, and help identify host targets for the development of new anti-bacterial molecules.</description><engagement>4</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301150v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301150v1?rss=1</link><published>1523689200000</published><title>Searching Algorithm for Type IV Effector proteins (S4TE) 2.0: improved tools for type IV effector prediction, analysis and comparison [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>5f36ca44</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Bacterial pathogens have evolved numerous strategies to corrupt, hijack or mimic cellular processes in order to survive and proliferate.

We describe the development and application of a suite of modular tools for high-resolution detection of proteins and intracellular protein complexes by electron microscopy (EM). Conditionally stable GFP- and mCherry-binding nanobodies (termed csGBP and csChBP, respectively) are characterized using a cell-free expression and analysis system and subsequently fused to an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) enzyme. Expression of these cassettes alongside fluorescently labelled proteins results in recruitment and stabilisation of APEX, whereas unbound APEX nanobodies are efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This greatly simplifies correlative analyses, enables detection of less-abundant proteins, and eliminates the need to balance expression levels between fluorescently labelled and APEX nanobody proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system to bimolecular complementation (‘EM split-fluorescent protein’), for localisation of protein–protein interactions at the ultrastructural level.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrmHIECypRw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e9:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas Ariotti, James Rae, Nichole Giles, Nick Martel, Emma Sierecki, Yann Gambin, Thomas E.

Repetitive DNA represents the major component of the genome in both plant and animal species. It includes transposable elements (TEs), which are dispersed throughout the genome, and satellite DNAs (satDNAs), which are tandemly organized in long arrays. The study of the structure and organization of repetitive DNA contributes to our understanding of genome architecture and the mechanisms leading to its evolution. Molluscs represent one of the largest groups of invertebrates and include organisms with a wide variety of morphologies and lifestyles. To increase our knowledge of bivalves at the genome level, we analysed the Antarctic scallop &lt;i&gt;Adamussium colbecki&lt;/i&gt;. The screening of the genomic library evidenced the presence of two novel satDNA elements and the CvA transposon. The interspecific investigation performed in this study demonstrated that one of the two satDNAs isolated in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;colbecki&lt;/i&gt; is widespread in polar molluscan species, indicating a possible link between repetitive DNA and abiotic factors.

While notable success has been reached in the field of tissue clarification and confocal imaging to obtain high-fidelity maps of three-dimensional neuron organization, neuron segmentation is still far away of ground-truth and manual segmentation performed by experts may be needed. The need of an expert is in part related to the limited success of the algorithms and tools performing single-neuron segmentation from 3D microscopic image data available in the State of Art, in part to the non-complete information given by these methods, which typically perform neuron tracing and thus limit the interpretability of results.

Advances in the understanding of molecular systems depend on specific tools like the disruption of genes to produce strains with the desired characteristics. The disruption of any mutagen sensitive (&lt;i&gt;mus&lt;/i&gt;) genes in the model fungus &lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. &lt;i&gt;mus-51&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mus-52&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;mus-53&lt;/i&gt;, orthologous to the human genes &lt;i&gt;KU70&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;KU80&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;LIG4&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, provides efficient tools for gene targeting.

Advances in the understanding of molecular systems depend on specific tools like the disruption of genes to produce strains with the desired characteristics. The disruption of any mutagen sensitive (&lt;i&gt;mus&lt;/i&gt;) genes in the model fungus &lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. &lt;i&gt;mus-51&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mus-52&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;mus-53&lt;/i&gt;, orthologous to the human genes &lt;i&gt;KU70&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;KU80&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;LIG4&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, provides efficient tools for gene targeting. Accordingly, we used RNA-sequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification techniques to evaluate the effects of &lt;i&gt;mus-52&lt;/i&gt; deletion in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;crassa&lt;/i&gt; gene transcriptional modulation, and thus, infer its influence regarding metabolic response to extracellular availability of inorganic phosphate (Pi).

The ecology of Lyme borreliosis is complex in northwestern California, with several potential reservoir hosts, tick vectors, and genospecies of &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato. The primary objective of this study was to determine the fine-scale spatial distribution of different genospecies in four rodent species, the California ground squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Otospermophilus beecheyi&lt;/i&gt;), northern flying squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Glaucomys sabrinus&lt;/i&gt;), dusky-footed woodrat (&lt;i&gt;Neotoma fuscipes&lt;/i&gt;), and Allen’s chipmunk (&lt;i&gt;Neotamias senex&lt;/i&gt;). Rodents were live-trapped between June 2004 and May 2005 at the Hoopa Valley Tribal Reservation (HVTR) in Humboldt County, California. Ear-punch biopsies obtained from each rodent were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis. The programs ArcGIS and SaTScan were used to examine the spatial distribution of genospecies. Multinomial log-linear models were used to model habitat and host-specific characteristics and their effect on the presence of each borrelial genospecies. The Akaike information criterion (AICc) was used to compare models and determine model fit. &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was primarily associated with chipmunks and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; largely with woodrats. The top model included the variables “host species”, “month”, and “elevation” (weight = 0.84). Spatial clustering of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; was detected in the northwestern section of the HVTR, whereas &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was clustered in the southeastern section. We conclude that the spatial distribution of these borreliae are driven at least in part by host species, time-of-year, and elevation.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195586</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195586</link><published>1523394000000</published><title>Spatial clustering of &amp;lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&amp;lt;/i&gt; sensu lato within populations of Allen&apos;s chipmunks and dusky-footed woodrats in northwestern California</title><fingerprint>968b65e3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gregory M.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Current diagnostic assessment tools remain suboptimal in demonstrating complex morphology of congenital heart disease (CHD). This limitation has posed several challenges in preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education. This study aims to investigate the dimensional accuracy and the clinical value of 3D printed model of CHD in the above three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data, a patient-specific 3D model of a 20-month-old boy with double outlet right ventricle was printed in Tango Plus material. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlation of the quantitative measurements taken at analogous anatomical locations between the CCTA images pre- and post-3D printing. Qualitative analysis was conducted by distributing surveys to six health professionals (two radiologists, two cardiologists and two cardiac surgeons) and three medical academics to assess the clinical value of the 3D printed model in these three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Excellent correlation (r = 0.99) was noted in the measurements between CCTA and 3D printed model, with a mean difference of 0.23 mm. Four out of six health professionals found the model to be useful in facilitating preoperative planning, while all of them thought that the model would be invaluable in enhancing patient-doctor communication. All three medical academics found the model to be helpful in teaching, and thought that the students will be able to learn the pathology quicker with better understanding.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The complex cardiac anatomy can be accurately replicated in flexible material using 3D printing technology. 3D printed heart models could serve as an excellent tool in facilitating preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education, although further studies with inclusion of more clinical cases are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>Clinical value of patient-specific three-dimensional printing of congenital heart disease: Quantitative and qualitative assessments</title><fingerprint>2e27b850</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Wen Wen Lau, Dongting Liu, Lei Xu, Zhanming Fan, Zhonghua Sun&lt;/p&gt;

Soil respiration induced by biological soil crusts (BSCs) is an important process in the carbon (C) cycle in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, where vascular plants are restricted by the harsh environment, particularly the limited soil moisture. However, the interaction between temperature and soil respiration remains uncertain because of the number of factors that control soil respiration, including temperature and soil moisture, especially in BSC-dominated areas. In this study, the soil respiration in moss-dominated crusts and lichen-dominated crusts was continuously measured using an automated soil respiration system over a one-year period from November 2015 to October 2016 in the Shapotou region of the Tengger Desert, northern China. The results indicated that over daily cycles, the half-hourly soil respiration rates in both types of BSC-covered areas were commonly related to the soil temperature. The observed diel hysteresis between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature in the BSC-covered areas was limited by nonlinearity loops with semielliptical shapes, and soil temperature often peaked later than the half-hourly soil respiration rates in the BSC-covered areas. The average lag times between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature for both types of BSC-covered areas were two hours over the diel cycles, and they were negatively and linearly related to the volumetric soil water content. Our results highlight the diel hysteresis phenomenon that occurs between soil respiration rates and soil temperatures in BSC-covered areas and the negative response of this phenomenon to soil moisture, which may influence total C budget evaluations. Therefore, the interactive effects of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration in BSC-covered areas should be considered in global carbon cycle models of desert ecosystems.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</link><published>1523048400000</published><title>Diel hysteresis between soil respiration and soil temperature in a biological soil crust covered desert ecosystem</title><fingerprint>e6b1c326</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guan, Xinrong Li, Peng Zhang, Yongle Chen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agglomerans&lt;/i&gt;) is a Gram-negative bacterium that grows symbiotically with various edible plants, and the oral or sublingual administration of lipopolysaccharide derived from &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; (LPSp) have been suggested to contribute to prevention of immune-related diseases. Our previous study indicated that orally administered LPSp was shown to exhibit an LDL-lowering effect in hyperlipidemic volunteers; however, a preventive effect of LPSp on atherosclerosis is unclear. The present study attempted to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic effect by LPSp in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis. For 16 weeks, apoE-deficient mice were fed an HFD and received drinking water containing LPSp (0.3 or 1 mg/kg body weight/day). The results showed that the orally administered LPSp decreased body weight. A significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque deposition was observed even with the lower dose of LPSp. The biochemical analyses showed that LPSp markedly improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma LDL and oxidized LDL levels. In addition, LPSp significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators including MCP-1 (in the plasma), TNF-α and IL-6 (in the colon), and decreased the oxidative burst activities in the peripheral blood sample. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that oral administration of LPSp can effectively ameliorate HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and inflammatory/oxidative responses to prevent atherosclerosis and related metabolic disorders.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195008</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195008</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Oral administration of &amp;lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&amp;lt;/i&gt;-derived lipopolysaccharide prevents development of atherosclerosis in high-fat diet-fed apoE-deficient mice via ameliorating hyperlipidemia, pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative responses</title><fingerprint>9848fbe4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yutaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Inagawa, Chie Kohchi, Kimiko Kazumura, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Miwa, Katsuichiro Okazaki, Gen-Ichiro Soma&lt;/p&gt;

The hypothesis that pigs placed on diets with reduced indispensable amino acid (AA) content attempts to offset the reduction in the nutrient density with increased feed intake was tested. In the experiment, feeds with a high or a low AA content were administrated to pigs fed &lt;i&gt;ad-libitum&lt;/i&gt; or restrictively according to a 2 × 2 factorial design. Ninety-six barrows were housed in 8 pens (12 pigs/pen) equipped with automatic feeders. Within pen, and from 47 body weight (BW) onwards, 6 pigs were fed &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt;. The others pigs were allowed to consume, as a maximum, the feed amounts indicated by the breeding company feeding plane to optimize the feed efficiency. In early (86–118 kg BW) and late (118–145 kg BW) finishing, the pigs of 4 pens received feeds with high indispensable AA contents (8.1 and 7.5 g lysine/kg in the two periods, respectively). The other pigs received feeds with reduced indispensable AA contents (lysine, methionine, threonine and tryptophan) by 9 and 18% in early and late finishing, respectively. Body lipid and protein (Pr) retentions were estimated from BW and back-fat depth measures recorded at the beginning and the end of each period. Nitrogen excretion was estimated as actual intake minus estimated N-retention (Pr/6.25). Pigs were slaughtered at 144 kg BW. Restricted feeding decreased feed intake (-7%), daily gain (-5%), carcass weight (-2.6%) and back-fat depth (-8.0%) but increased gain:feed ratio (+2%). The AA restriction increased feed intake (+5.9%), carcass weight (+4.9%) and intramuscular fat (+17.6%), and reduced carcass weight variation (-36%), with no effects on the feed efficiency and the estimated Pr (142 g/d). N excreted was reduced by feed (-9%) and dietary AA (-15%) restrictions. Irrespectively of the feeding level, the pigs responded to a reduction of the dietary essential AA content by increasing their feed intake.</description><engagement>3</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195645</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195645</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Effects of feed allowance and indispensable amino acid reduction on feed intake, growth performance and carcass characteristics of growing pigs</title><fingerprint>3de839a6</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefano Schiavon, Mirco Dalla Bona, Giuseppe Carcò, Luca Carraro, Lutz Bunger, Luigi Gallo&lt;/p&gt;

We have previously characterized Pir32, a &lt;i&gt;Candia albicans&lt;/i&gt; cell wall protein that we found to be involved in filamentation, virulence, chitin deposition, and resistance to oxidative stress. Other than defining the cell shape, the cell wall is critical for the interaction with the surrounding environment and the point of contact and interaction with the host surface. In this study, we applied tandem mass spectrometry combined with bioinformatics to investigate cell wall proteome changes in a &lt;i&gt;pir32&lt;/i&gt; null strain. A total of 16 and 25 proteins were identified exclusively in the null mutant strains grown under non-filamentous and filamentous conditions. These proteins included members of the PGA family with various functions, lipase and the protease involved in virulence, superoxide dismutases required for resisting oxidative stress, alongside proteins required for cell wall remodeling and synthesis such as Ssr1, Xog1, Dfg5 and Dcw1.

We have previously characterized Pir32, a &lt;i&gt;Candia albicans&lt;/i&gt; cell wall protein that we found to be involved in filamentation, virulence, chitin deposition, and resistance to oxidative stress. Other than defining the cell shape, the cell wall is critical for the interaction with the surrounding environment and the point of contact and interaction with the host surface. In this study, we applied tandem mass spectrometry combined with bioinformatics to investigate cell wall proteome changes in a &lt;i&gt;pir32&lt;/i&gt; null strain. A total of 16 and 25 proteins were identified exclusively in the null mutant strains grown under non-filamentous and filamentous conditions. These proteins included members of the PGA family with various functions, lipase and the protease involved in virulence, superoxide dismutases required for resisting oxidative stress, alongside proteins required for cell wall remodeling and synthesis such as Ssr1, Xog1, Dfg5 and Dcw1. In addition proteins needed for filamentation like Cdc42, Ssu81 and Ucf1, and other virulence proteins such as Als3, Rbt5, and Csa2 were also detected. The detection of these proteins in the mutant and their lack of detection in the wild type can explain the differential phenotypes previously observed.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194403</canonicalUrl><updated>1521493200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f8:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13400</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>According to this new survey, depression and anxiety are far more common among graduate students than in the general population.

This should surprise no one at all, but it’s good to have some quantitative data on the problem. There are limitations to the study – for one thing, it’s quite possible that (self-selected) respondents were among those more likely to have experienced these problems. The survey was done across 26 different countries (over 2200 respondents), 70% female/28% male/2% transgender, and the fields of study involved were 56% humanities and 38% physical sciences – no breakdown of the numbers by these categories is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these reservations, I have no trouble believing the overall conclusions – based on my own experience and my observations since, I think that anxiety and depression are &lt;em&gt;very close to inevitable&lt;/em&gt; in graduate study, and that students should be aware of what they’re getting into. What’s happening, in any field, is the rubber finally meeting the road: you’re not just sitting in classrooms; you’re doing what practitioners of your chosen line of work actually do, and you’re finding out what that’s really like and whether or not you’re any good at it. If that doesn’t bring on the occasional bout of anxiety and self-doubt, then something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from that to depression is not such a huge jump, either. All of us who have been through grad school have seen people who sort of freeze up at some point in their progress. Sometimes it happens near the beginning, such as when chemistry graduate students move out of classes and into the labs – some of them just can’t seem to get anything going. I remember people who were always just about to start something, just about to figure out what went wrong with the last thing (which was spread out into a bunch of inconclusive samples around their hoods), just about to really start making some progress. But they never did. Later in the process, another familiar figure is the person who’s been hanging around for years in the lab, running ever more experiments to avoid writing up, as is their near-relative, the person who’s actually out of the lab, writing up that dissertation/thesis, expected to set a defense date pretty soon. . .and who in the end, is never heard from again after a while, finding themselves unable to get the thing done. After a while, the official notices from the department come back stamped “Addressee unknown”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression might well be a good description of what’s going on in many of these situations. Someone finds themselves in an untenable situation and sinks into a state that makes it more untenable every day. David Foster Wallace defined a harmful addiction as something that offered itself as the remedy for the problems that it itself was causing (as with alcohol), and the downward-spiral mode of life has some similarities, as a big factor in what put you into this spot makes you ever less likely to do anything about it. The canonical view of major depression from the inside is William Styron’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2pFf7lZ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darkness Visible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but you don’t have to be as far along as Styron was to be in real trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I got quite as far as depression myself, but there’s no doubt that I was under significant stress. Even the stock of stories that I have from grad school illustrates that. So many of them feature me losing my temper about something, and honestly, I rarely do that out here in the real world. I well recall unnerving bouts of fear and uncertainty, wondering if I was doing the right thing with my life, wondering if it was too late to do much about that even if I were, wondering if my research was any good or if I was any good at doing it, and what I was going to do about it if the answer to either or both of those were actually “No”. And so on. By the end of it, I was thoroughly sick of my project, wildly ready to get out the door and see what the post-doc life was going to be like (and very much wondering if it would turn out to be more of the same, in a different location).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw some outright breakdowns while I was in grad school – there’s no other way to describe them. In some cases a person’s hours and behavior would become erratic, their actions hard to understand or predict. Sometimes in these the ship would apparently right itself and sometimes it wouldn’t. I saw examples of just those situations mentioned above, with people unable to make a real start in research or unable to write up at the end of it. And there was one flat-out suicide attempt, very nearly successful and permanently damaging to the person involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my own worst moments, I would be standing there in the lab feeling like a pitcher out on the mound who had just shaken off every pitch he knew how to throw. I was hauling material up the mountainside of a long linear synthesis, and I was frustrated to a degree beyond anything I’d ever experienced. I didn’t feel like working up the reactions in front of me, and I didn’t feel like setting up others. Waiting for me was my reward at the end of twenty-odd linear steps, the chance to risk all my hard work by trying (finally) some new chemistry that would probably not work and might well destroy my starting material in the process. Oh joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve told this next story before, but can’t track down the post where I did. At any rate, a pivotal moment was when I was bashing along with the largest load of starting material I’d ever made. Up at around step 9 (I was still in liter-sized flask territory) I was ready to work up the whole batch after a late-night reaction. I added some ammonium chloride and extracted the black mixture. That didn’t worry me; it was always black. I evaporated it down to a bunch of black oil and loaded it on a big gravity column of coarse silica gel – from prior runs, I knew that would hold the black crud at the top and allow a big yellow band of product to elute. Except this time the whole column turned black. Must have overloaded the column with this big pile of material, I thought. I collected a bunch of black fractions and rota-vapped them down, only to find what I sort of thought was a lot less oil than I’d been expecting. Reserving worry, I set up another column on that stuff, and this time the whole column turned black again, and nothing at all came out the other end but slightly discolored solvent. I had, in fact, destroyed my entire huge batch, because at 2 AM I was too groggy to remember that I was supposed to work it up with saturated bicarb, not ammonium chloride. All gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood there, alone, in the middle of the night, looking at all the mess I’d created. Ruined, all that batch of material that was going to finally get my synthesis finished and get me out of this place. I shook my head, cursed loudly, and went home, and to my surprise I fell asleep fairly quickly. What else was there to do? I woke up the next morning and went through that terrible disorienting feeling when after a few seconds you suddenly remember that something bad happened the night before. And then I got up and went to the lab, and set up an even larger batch back at the beginning of the synthesis, step one. Looking back, that night and that morning were a key episode in my graduate career and my life in general, because that batch I started that next day really did get me out in the end. I had bent and come very close to breaking at times, but it turned out that the worst had happened and I was still in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things definitely could have gone in other ways, though, and if they had there’s no telling where I would be now or what I would be doing. If that incident had happened to me a year before, I don’t know how I would have taken it. By the time I speak of, I had my eyes on the door and a PhD defense, having decided that the shortest way out of this awful situation was in that direction. I was devoting all my efforts to it, in an “OK, did today get me closer to defending, or not?” sort of way. Earlier, though, I was too far from the beginning and too far from the end to have that mindset, and a whopping failure would not have gone down well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important for graduate students to realize that &lt;em&gt;everyone has these doubts and bad stretches&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone has these moments when they wonder what they’ve done to their lives, but having these thoughts is &lt;em&gt;not a sign&lt;/em&gt; that the exact failure you’re fearing has arrived. That doesn’t mean that thinking about your purpose in grad school is a bad thing, but it probably is a bad thing to try to do it at periods of peak emotional stress. If you feel that it really is getting too much, definitely talk to someone. Universities have people around for just that purpose – more so than in my day, fortunately – and if you find yourself wondering if you should reach out like that, then odds are that you should. Do it. I wish some of the people I worked with had, or had been able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any meaningful graduate degree is going to be a test of your abilities and your resilience. Recognize this, and avoid the two extremes. On one end are the macho types whose response is “Eat stress for breakfast! That’s what I did in my day! If you don’t have the fire in your belly you don’t belong here!”. And on the other end are the voices, some perhaps external and some internal, telling you that you’re a failure already, an imposter, and that you’re never going to measure up anyway. These are two different sets of lies, and everyone has to steer their course between them.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Graduate School</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162629ce0bc:5b03560:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522072871100</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/26/depression-and-anxiety-in-graduate-school</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194747</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Arne Pommerening</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arne Pommerening, Carlos Pallarés Ramos, Wojciech Kędziora, Jens Haufe, Dietrich Stoyan&lt;/p&gt;
The process of selecting individual trees by humans for forest management purposes is the result of a plethora of factors and processes that are hard to disentangle. And yet in the past many textbooks and other publications have maintained that this selection leads to somewhat unanimous results. In this study, we analysed the data of 36 so-called marteloscope experiments from all over Britain, which are managed by the Ae Training Centre (Scotland, UK). Our objective was (1) to establish how much agreement there actually was when asking test persons (raters) to apply two different thinning methods, low and crown thinning. In addition we (2) were interested in understanding some of the processes leading to certain levels of agreement and in relationships between the agreement measures and characteristics of forest structure. Our analysis was based on multivariate statistics, particularly using Fleiss’ kappa. This was the first time that an analysis of rater behaviour was performed at such a large scale and it revealed that the general agreement in tree selection in Britain was only slight to fair, i.e. much lower than in medical experiments. The variability of selecting individual trees was considerable. We also found that agreement in tree selection was much stronger in low-thinning as opposed to crown-thinning experiments. As the latter is an important method of Continuous Cover Forestry and British forestry is increasingly adopting this forest management type, our results suggested that there is a need to provide more training. Interestingly the different levels of agreement as identified by Fleiss’ kappa could not be explained by measures of forest structure, however, the mean conformity number, a surrogate of Fleiss’ kappa, showed correlations and indicated that conformity increased with increasing complexity of tree stem diameter structure.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194747</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194747</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Rating experiments in forestry: How much agreement is there in tree marking?</title><fingerprint>54ebcb40</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arne Pommerening, Carlos Pallarés Ramos, Wojciech Kędziora, Jens Haufe, Dietrich Stoyan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria are able to grow in a planktonic state that is associated with acute infections and in biofilms that are associated with chronic infections. Acute infections, such as skin infections, are often self-limiting. However, chronic infections, such as implant infections, can be difficult to clear and may require surgical intervention. The host immune response may contribute to the different outcomes often associated with these two disease types. We used proteomic arrays and two murine models for an initial, descriptive characterization of the contribution of the host immune response to outcomes of acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; disease. We compared the immune responses between a model of self-limiting skin and soft tissue infection caused by the planktonic form of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; versus a model of surgical mesh implant infection, which we show to be caused by a bacterial biofilm. The significantly altered host cytokines and chemokines were largely different in the two models, with responses diminished by 21 days post-implantation in surgical mesh infection. Because bacterial levels remained constant during the 21 days that the surgical mesh infection was followed, those cytokines that are significantly increased during chronic infection are not likely effective in eradicating biofilm. Comparison of the levels of cytokines and chemokines in acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; infection can provide a starting point for evaluation of the role of specific immune factors that are present in one disease manifestation but not the other.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195342</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195342</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Comparison of the immune response during acute and chronic &amp;lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&amp;lt;/i&gt; infection</title><fingerprint>c9c56a66</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca A.

Fitting canine cancer incidences through a conventional regression model assumes constant statistical relationships across the study area in estimating the model coefficients. However, it is often more realistic to consider that these relationships may vary over space. Such a condition, known as spatial non-stationarity, implies that the model coefficients need to be estimated locally. In these kinds of local models, the geographic scale, or spatial extent, employed for coefficient estimation may also have a pervasive influence. This is because important variations in the local model coefficients across geographic scales may impact the understanding of local relationships. In this study, we fitted canine cancer incidences across Swiss municipal units through multiple regional models. We computed diagnostic summaries across the different regional models, and contrasted them with the diagnostics of the conventional regression model, using value-by-alpha maps and scalograms. The results of this comparative assessment enabled us to identify variations in the goodness-of-fit and coefficient estimates. We detected spatially non-stationary relationships, in particular, for the variables related to biological risk factors. These variations in the model coefficients were more important at small geographic scales, making a case for the need to model canine cancer incidences locally in contrast to more conventional global approaches. However, we contend that prior to undertaking local modeling efforts, a deeper understanding of the effects of geographic scale is needed to better characterize and identify local model relationships.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195970</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195970</link><published>1523653200000</published><title>The importance of regional models in assessing canine cancer incidences in Switzerland</title><fingerprint>231e0806</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gianluca Boo, Stefan Leyk, Christopher Brunsdon, Ramona Graf, Andreas Pospischil, Sara Irina Fabrikant&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Phenylephrine is an α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adrenergic receptor agonist that causes pulmonary vasoconstriction, and so may effectively enhance hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, there is little evidence that phenylephrine augments HPV in clinical situations. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of phenylephrine infusion on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Included patients were those undergoing elective thoracic surgery in the lateral decubitus position with OLV. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The N-P group initially had OLV with normal saline infusion for 30 minutes; after a 10 minute interval, OLV was then maintained with phenylephrine infusion for 30 minutes. The P-N group had the drug-infusion in the reverse order. The primary outcome was arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Secondary outcomes were mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure variation, perfusion index, and difference between bladder and skin temperature. Statistical analysis was performed using the student t-test, Fisher&apos;s exact test, and ANOVA for Cross-over design. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine patients were analyzed.

Background &lt;p&gt;Phenylephrine is an α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adrenergic receptor agonist that causes pulmonary vasoconstriction, and so may effectively enhance hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, there is little evidence that phenylephrine augments HPV in clinical situations. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of phenylephrine infusion on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Included patients were those undergoing elective thoracic surgery in the lateral decubitus position with OLV. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The N-P group initially had OLV with normal saline infusion for 30 minutes; after a 10 minute interval, OLV was then maintained with phenylephrine infusion for 30 minutes. The P-N group had the drug-infusion in the reverse order. The primary outcome was arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Secondary outcomes were mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure variation, perfusion index, and difference between bladder and skin temperature. Statistical analysis was performed using the student t-test, Fisher&apos;s exact test, and ANOVA for Cross-over design. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine patients were analyzed. Although phenylephrine infusion significantly increased mean arterial pressure (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), arterial partial pressure of oxygen did not differ between the two timepoints (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.19). There was no carryover effect in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.14). Phenylephrine infusion significantly decreased heart rate (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) and pulse pressure variation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Phenylephrine infusion did not improve oxygenation during OLV. The present results indicate that phenylephrine does not have clinically meaningful effects on HPV.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;University Hospital Medical Information Network 000024317&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195576</canonicalUrl><updated>1523307600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715297:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195656</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Aleikar Vásquez-Suárez</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aleikar Vásquez-Suárez, Francisco Lobos-González, Andrew Cronshaw, José Sepúlveda-Ugarte, Maximiliano Figueroa, Jorge Dagnino-Leone, Marta Bunster, José Martínez-Oyanedel&lt;/p&gt;
Phycobilisomes (PBS) are accessory light harvesting protein complexes formed mainly by phycobiliproteins (PBPs). The PBPs absorb light that is efficiently transferred to Photosystems due to chromophores covalently bound to specific cysteine residues. Besides phycobiliproteins (PE), the PBS contains linker proteins responsible for assembly and stabilization of the whole complex and the tuning of energy transfer steps between chromophores. The linker (γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;) from &lt;i&gt;Gracilaria chilensis&lt;/i&gt;, is a chromophorylated rod linker associated to (αβ)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; hexamers of R-phycoerythrin (R-PE). Its role in the energy transfer process is not clear yet. Structural studies as well as the composition and location of the chromophores are essential to understand their involvement in the energy transfer process in PBS. To achieve this, the coding gene of γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was analyzed by informatics tools, to obtain preliminary information which leaded the next experiments. The protein was purified from R-phycoerythrin, and the sequence confirmed by mass spectrometry. The coding sequence analysis revealed a protein of 318 aminoacid residues containing a chloroplastidial transit peptide (cTP) of 39 aminoacids at the N-terminus. The conservation of cysteines revealed possible chromophorylation sites. Using α and β R-PE subunits as spectroscopic probes in denaturation assays, we deduced a double bonded phycourobilin (PUB) on γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; subunit that were confirmed between Cys62 and Cys73 (DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;62/73&lt;/sup&gt;) by mass spectrometry. The cysteines involved in the double link are located in a helical region, in a conformation that reminds the position of the DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;50/61&lt;/sup&gt; in the β subunit of R-PE. The position of single linked PUB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt; and a single linked PEB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; were also confirmed. Spectroscopic studies show the presence of both types of chromophores and that there are not energy transfer by FRET among them.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195656</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195656</link><published>1523394000000</published><title>The γ&amp;lt;sup&gt;33&amp;lt;/sup&gt; subunit of R-phycoerythrin from &amp;lt;i&gt;Gracilaria chilensis&amp;lt;/i&gt; has a typical double linked phycourobilin similar to γ subunit</title><fingerprint>7c771e50</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aleikar Vásquez-Suárez, Francisco Lobos-González, Andrew Cronshaw, José Sepúlveda-Ugarte, Maximiliano Figueroa, Jorge Dagnino-Leone, Marta Bunster, José Martínez-Oyanedel&lt;/p&gt;

Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis (FFEA) is a software package designed to perform continuum mechanics simulations of proteins and other globular macromolecules. It combines conventional finite element methods with stochastic thermal noise, and is appropriate for simulations of large proteins and protein complexes at the mesoscale (length-scales in the range of 5 nm to 1 μm), where there is currently a paucity of modelling tools. It requires 3D volumetric information as input, which can be low resolution structural information such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps or much higher resolution atomistic co-ordinates from which volumetric information can be extracted. In this article we introduce our open source software package for performing FFEA simulations which we have released under a GPLv3 license. The software package includes a C ++ implementation of FFEA, together with tools to assist the user to set up the system from Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) or Protein Data Bank (PDB) data files. We also provide a PyMOL plugin to perform basic visualisation and additional Python tools for the analysis of FFEA simulation trajectories. This manuscript provides a basic background to the FFEA method, describing the implementation of the core mechanical model and how intermolecular interactions and the solvent environment are included within this framework. We provide prospective FFEA users with a practical overview of how to set up an FFEA simulation with reference to our publicly available online tutorials and manuals that accompany this first release of the package.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hC4qKh8DkTM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1521838800000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16253fa0281:3c81d7:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Albert Solernou, Benjamin S.

Despite the important role of apolipoprotein E (apoE) secretion from astrocytes in brain lipid metabolism and the strong association of apoE4, one of the human apoE isoforms, with sporadic and late onset forms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) little is known about the regulation of astrocytic apoE. Utilizing annotated chemical libraries and a phenotypic screening strategy that measured apoE secretion from a human astrocytoma cell line, inhibition of pan class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) was identified as a mechanism to increase apoE secretion. Knocking down select HDAC family members alone or in combination revealed that inhibition of the class I HDAC family was responsible for enhancing apoE secretion. Knocking down LXRα and LXRβ genes revealed that the increase in astrocytic apoE in response to HDAC inhibition occurred via an LXR-independent pathway. Collectively, these data suggest that pan class I HDAC inhibition is a novel pathway for regulating astrocytic apoE secretion.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194661</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194661</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>Class I HDAC inhibition is a novel pathway for regulating astrocytic apoE secretion</title><fingerprint>7f725708</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Erica Dresselhaus, James M.

The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is an evolutionary conserved cholesterol binding protein localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Expression of TSPO is upregulated in activated microglia in various neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic disorders. Therefore, TSPO radioligands are used as biomarkers in positron emission tomography (PET) studies. In particular, a common A147T polymorphism in the TSPO gene affects binding of several high affinity TSPO radioligands. Given the relevance of TSPO as a diagnostic biomarker in disease processes, we systematically searched for mutations in the human TSPO gene by a wide array of evolution and structure based bioinformatics tools and identified potentially deleterious missense mutations. The two most frequently observed missense mutations A147T and R162H were further analysed in structural models of human wildtype and mutant TSPO proteins. The effects of missense mutations were studied on the atomic level using molecular dynamics simulations. To analyse putative effects of A147T and R162H variants on protein stability we established primary dermal fibroblast cultures from wt and homozygous A147T and R162H donors. Stability of endogenous TSPO protein, which is abundantly expressed in fibroblasts, was studied using cycloheximide protein degradation assay. Our data show that the A147T mutation significantly alters the flexibility and stability of the mutant protein. Furthermore both A147T and R162H mutations decreased the half-life of the mutant proteins by about 25 percent, which could in part explain its effect on reduced pregnenolone production and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study is the first comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of genetic variants in the TSPO gene, thereby extending the knowledge about the clinical relevance of TSPO nsSNPs.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195627</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195627</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Effects of genetic variants in the TSPO gene on protein structure and stability</title><fingerprint>6738bd2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vladimir M.

&lt;i&gt;Edwardsiella ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; is a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic rod and the causative agent of enteric septicemia of channel catfish (ESC), which is one of the most prevalent diseases of catfish, causing significant economic losses in the catfish industry. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; is resistant to complement system and macrophage killing, which results in rapid systemic septicemia.

One key question is how such cells are specified and then protected from differentiation for a prolonged period. Investigating the maintenance of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; muscle progenitors (MPs) we demonstrate that it involves a switch in &lt;i&gt;zfh1/ZEB1&lt;/i&gt; RNA-isoforms. Differentiation into functional muscles is accompanied by expression of &lt;i&gt;miR-8/miR-200&lt;/i&gt;, which targets the major &lt;i&gt;zfh1-long&lt;/i&gt; RNA isoform and decreases Zfh1 protein. Through activity of the Notch pathway, a subset of MPs produce an alternate &lt;i&gt;zfh1-short&lt;/i&gt; isoform, which lacks the &lt;i&gt;miR-8&lt;/i&gt; seed site. Zfh1 protein is thus maintained in these cells, enabling them to escape differentiation and persist as MPs in the adult. There, like mammalian satellite cells, they contribute to muscle homeostasis. Such preferential regulation of a specific RNA isoform, with differential sensitivity to miRs, is a powerful mechanism for maintaining a population of poised progenitors and may be of widespread significance.</description><engagement>30</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35954</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Adult stem cells are important for tissue maintenance and repair.

Differentiation into functional muscles is accompanied by expression of &lt;i&gt;miR-8/miR-200&lt;/i&gt;, which targets the major &lt;i&gt;zfh1-long&lt;/i&gt; RNA isoform and decreases Zfh1 protein. Through activity of the Notch pathway, a subset of MPs produce an alternate &lt;i&gt;zfh1-short&lt;/i&gt; isoform, which lacks the &lt;i&gt;miR-8&lt;/i&gt; seed site. Zfh1 protein is thus maintained in these cells, enabling them to escape differentiation and persist as MPs in the adult. There, like mammalian satellite cells, they contribute to muscle homeostasis. Such preferential regulation of a specific RNA isoform, with differential sensitivity to miRs, is a powerful mechanism for maintaining a population of poised progenitors and may be of widespread significance.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35954</link><published>1523232000000</published><title>A population of adult satellite-like cells in Drosophila is maintained through a switch in RNA-isoforms</title><fingerprint>326ab480</fingerprint><keywords><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162ab42786d:16eef5c:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523291682925</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35954</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3054.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Hahnbeom Park, Sergey Ovchinnikov, David E.

The large body of work demonstrating hyperthermic impairment of neuromuscular function has utilized maximal isometric contractions, but extrapolating these findings to whole-body exercise and submaximal, dynamic contractions may be problematic. We isolated and compared core and skin temperature influences on an isometric force task versus a position task requiring dynamic maintenance of joint angle. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured on the flexor carpi radialis at 60% of baseline maximal voluntary contraction while either pushing against a rigid restraint (force task) or while maintaining a constant wrist angle and supporting an equivalent inertial load (position task). Twenty participants performed each task at 0.5°C rectal temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;) intervals while being passively heated from 37.1±0.3°C to ≥1.5°C T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; and then cooled to 37.8±0.3°C, permitting separate analyses of core versus skin temperature influences. During a 3-s contraction, trend analysis revealed a quadratic trend that peaked during hyperthermia for root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude during the force task. In contrast, RMS amplitude during the position task remained stable with passive heating, then rapidly increased with the initial decrease in skin temperature at the onset of passive cooling (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010). Combined hot core and hot skin elicited shifts toward higher frequencies in the sEMG signal during the force task (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), whereas inconsistent changes in the frequency spectra occurred for the position task. Based on the patterns of RMS amplitude in response to thermal stress, we conclude that core temperature was the primary thermal afferent influencing neuromuscular response during a submaximal force task, with minimal input from skin temperature. However, skin temperature was the primary thermal afferent during a position task with minimal core temperature influence. Therefore, temperature has a task-dependent impact on neuromuscular responses.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195219</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195219</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Core and skin temperature influences on the surface electromyographic responses to an isometric force and position task</title><fingerprint>8544f1bc</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nico A.

Therefore, temperature has a task-dependent impact on neuromuscular responses.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195219</canonicalUrl><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde29:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302489v2?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><author><name>Awan, M.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We aimed to describe ethnic variations in infant mortality and explore the contribution of area deprivation, mother’s country of birth, and prematurity to these variations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed routine birth and death data on singleton live births (gestational age≥22 weeks) in England and Wales, 2006–2012. Infant mortality by ethnic group was analyzed using logistic regression with adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics and gestational age.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the 4,634,932 births analyzed, crude infant mortality rates were higher in Pakistani, Black Caribbean, Black African, and Bangladeshi infants (6.92, 6.00, 5.17 and 4.40 per 1,000 live births, respectively vs. 2.87 in White British infants). Adjustment for maternal sociodemographic characteristics changed the results little. Further adjustment for gestational age strongly attenuated the risk in Black Caribbean (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89–1.17) and Black African infants (1.17, 1.06–1.29) but not in Pakistani (2.32, 2.15–2.50), Bangladeshi (1.47, 1.28–1.69), and Indian infants (1.24, 1.11–1.38). Ethnic variations in infant mortality differed significantly between term and preterm infants. At term, South Asian groups had higher risks which cannot be explained by sociodemographic characteristics. In preterm infants, adjustment for degree of prematurity (&amp;lt;28, 28–31, 32–33, 34–36 weeks) fully explained increased risks in Black but not Pakistani and Bangladeshi infants. Sensitivity analyses with further adjustment for small for gestational age, or excluding deaths due to congenital anomalies did not fully explain the excess risk in South Asian groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Higher infant mortality in South Asian and Black infants does not appear to be explained by sociodemographic characteristics. Higher proportions of very premature infants appear to explain increased risks in Black infants but not in South Asian groups. Strategies targeting the prevention and management of preterm birth in Black groups and suboptimal birthweight and modifiable risk factors for congenital anomalies in South Asian groups might help reduce ethnic inequalities in infant mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195146</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195146</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>The contribution of gestational age, area deprivation and mother’s country of birth to ethnic variations in infant mortality in England and Wales: A national cohort study using routinely collected data</title><fingerprint>b2f3fd34</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yangmei Li, Maria A.

Background &lt;p&gt;The growing shale gas (“fracking”) industry depends on a mobile workforce, whose influx could have social impacts on host communities. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This first report of a link between shale gas activity and increased rates of both chlamydia and gonorrhea may inform local policies and community health efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194203</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194203</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Shale gas activity and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections in Ohio, 2000–2016</title><fingerprint>d51c9d5f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicole C.

No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This first report of a link between shale gas activity and increased rates of both chlamydia and gonorrhea may inform local policies and community health efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194203</canonicalUrl><updated>1521838800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51c1:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34353</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><author><name>migaev@mpibpc.mpg.de (Helmut Grubmüller)</name></author><description>Microtubules (MTs) are key components of the cytoskeleton and play a central role in cell division and development.

The Salmon louse (&lt;i&gt;Lepeophtheirus salmonis&lt;/i&gt;) is a marine ectoparasite of salmonid fish in the Northern Hemisphere and considered as a major challenge in aquaculture and a threat to wild populations of salmonids. Adult female lice produce a large number of lipid-rich eggs, however, the mechanism of maternal lipid transport into developing eggs during salmon louse reproduction has not been described. In the present study, a full-length &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonis&lt;/i&gt; lipophorin receptor (&lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt;) consisting of 16 exons was obtained by RACE and RT-PCR. The predicted ORF was 952 amino acids and structural analysis showed five functional domains that are similar to LpR of insects and decapods. Phylogenetic analysis placed the LsLpR together with LpRs from decapods and insects. Expression analysis revealed that the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts was highest in the larvae and adult female lice. In adult females, the &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts and protein were found in the ovary and vitellogenic oocytes whereas, in larvae, the &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts were found in the neuronal somata of the brain and the intestine. Oil Red O stain results revealed that storage of neutral lipids was found in vitellogenic oocytes and ovaries of adult females, and in the yolk of larvae. Moreover, RNA interference (RNAi) was conducted to demonstrate the function of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; in reproduction and lipid metabolism in &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonis&lt;/i&gt;. In larvae, the transcription of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; was decreased by 44–54% while in an experiment &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; knockdown female lice produced 72% less offspring than control lice.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195783</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195783</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Molecular characterization of the lipophorin receptor in the crustacean ectoparasite &amp;lt;i&gt;Lepeophtheirus salmonis&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>f5ffbd1c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Tanveer Khan, Sussie Dalvin, Qaiser Waheed, Frank Nilsen, Rune Male&lt;/p&gt;

It is now well accepted that radiation induced bystander effects can occur in cells exposed to media from irradiated cells. The aim of this study was to follow the bystander cells in real time following addition of media from irradiated cells and to determine the effect of inhibiting these signals. A human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT cells, was irradiated (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy) with γ irradiation, conditioned medium was harvested after one hour and added to recipient bystander cells. Reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, Glutathione levels, caspase activation, cytotoxicity and cell viability was measured after the addition of irradiated cell conditioned media to bystander cells. Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide levels in bystander cells treated with 0.5Gy ICCM were analysed in real time using time lapse fluorescence microscopy. The levels of reactive oxygen species were also measured in real time after the addition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase pathway inhibitors. ROS and glutathione levels were observed to increase after the addition of irradiated cell conditioned media (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM). Caspase activation was found to increase 4 hours after irradiated cell conditioned media treatment (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM) and this increase was observed up to 8 hours and there after a reduction in caspase activation was observed. A decrease in cell viability was observed but no major change in cytotoxicity was found in HaCaT cells after treatment with irradiated cell conditioned media (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM). This study involved the identification of key signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, glutathione and caspases generated in bystander cells. These results suggest a clear connection between reactive oxygen species and cell survival pathways with persistent production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in bystander cells following exposure to irradiated cell conditioned media.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195371</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195371</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide signaling in bystander cells</title><fingerprint>dc124b60</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kishore Kumar Jella, Roisin Moriarty, Brendan McClean, Hugh J.

Recent data suggest the existence of a complement alternative pathway activation in the pathogenesis of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a condition that remains poorly understood. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients with regard to their plasma complement levels at diagnosis. A retrospective monocentric study carried out at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of proteinase-3- or myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA and MPA patients from January 2000 to June 2016 and from September 2011 to June 2016, respectively. All patients with available C3 and C4 levels at diagnosis were included. Patients were categorized in the hypocomplementemia group if their C3 and/or C4 levels at diagnosis were below the lower limit of the normal range. Among the 76 AAV patients (43 GPA, 33 MPA), 4 (5%) had hypocomplementemia, and the 72 remaining patients exhibited normal plasma complement levels. All 4 hypocomplementemia patients had renal involvement. Hypocomplementemia was followed in 1 patient whose post-treatment complement level normalized within 1 month. Among all clinical and ANCA specificity, including relapse-free survival (p = 0.093), only overall and renal survival rates were significantly lower in the hypocomplementemia group (p = 0.0011 and p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). Hypocomplementemia with low C3 and/or C4 levels at GPA or MPA diagnosis may be responsible for worse survival and renal prognosis. These results argue for larger and prospective studies to better determine the epidemiology of the disease and to assess complement-targeting therapy in these patients.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195680</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195680</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Hypocomplementemia is associated with worse renal survival in ANCA-positive granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis</title><fingerprint>f834d69c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Deshayes, Achille Aouba, Kathy Khoy, Delphine Mariotte, Thierry Lobbedez, Nicolas Martin Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Among all clinical and ANCA specificity, including relapse-free survival (p = 0.093), only overall and renal survival rates were significantly lower in the hypocomplementemia group (p = 0.0011 and p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). Hypocomplementemia with low C3 and/or C4 levels at GPA or MPA diagnosis may be responsible for worse survival and renal prognosis. These results argue for larger and prospective studies to better determine the epidemiology of the disease and to assess complement-targeting therapy in these patients.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195680</canonicalUrl><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d74c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12100</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Xing Cheng, Ping An, Shujin Li, Liping Zhou</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b12100/20180417/images/medium/jp-2017-12100j_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12100&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Strategic purchasing is an essential health financing function. This paper compares the strategic purchasing practices of Thailand’s two tax-financed health insurance schemes, the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), and identifies factors contributing to successful universal health coverage outcomes by analysing the relationships between the purchaser and government, providers and members. The study uses a cross-sectional mixed-methods design, including document review and interviews with 56 key informants. The Comptroller General Department (CGD) of Ministry of Finance manages CSMBS as one among civil servant welfare programmes. Their purchasing is passive. Fee for service payment for outpatient care has resulted in rapid cost escalation and overspending of their annual budget. In contrast, National Health Security Office (NHSO) manages purchasing for UCS, which undertakes a range of strategic purchasing actions, including applying closed ended provider payment, promoting primary healthcare’s gate keeping functions, exercising collective purchasing power and engaging views of members in decision making process. This difference in purchasing arrangements resulted in expenditure per CSMBS member being 4 times higher than UCS in 2014. The governance of the purchaser organization, the design of the purchasing arrangements including incentives and use of information, and the institutional capacities to implement purchasing functions are essential for effective strategic purchasing which can improve health system efficiency as a whole.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195179</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195179</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>Strategic purchasing and health system efficiency: A comparison of two financing schemes in Thailand</title><fingerprint>9ee1557c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Walaiporn Patcharanarumol, Warisa Panichkriangkrai, Angkana Sommanuttaweechai, Kara Hanson, Yaowaluk Wanwong, Viroj Tangcharoensathien&lt;/p&gt;

The current work examined the unique contribution that autistic traits and social anxiety have on tasks examining attention and emotion processing. In Study 1, 119 typically-developing college students completed a flanker task assessing the control of attention to target faces and away from distracting faces during emotion identification. In Study 2, 208 typically-developing college students performed a visual search task which required identification of whether a series of 8 or 16 emotional faces depicted the same or different emotions. Participants with more self-reported autistic traits performed more slowly on the flanker task in Study 1 than those with fewer autistic traits when stimuli depicted complex emotions. In Study 2, participants higher in social anxiety performed less accurately on trials showing all complex faces; participants with autistic traits showed no differences. These studies suggest that traits related to autism and to social anxiety differentially impact social cognitive processing.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195239</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195239</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Autistic traits and social anxiety predict differential performance on social cognitive tasks in typically developing young adults</title><fingerprint>63608f50</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cheryl L.

By killing cattle and otherwise complicating management, the many species of larkspur (&lt;i&gt;Delphinium&lt;/i&gt; spp.) present a serious, intractable, and complex challenge to livestock grazing management in the western United States. Among the many obstacles to improving our understanding of cattle-larkspur dynamics has been the difficulty of testing different grazing management strategies in the field, as the risk of dead animals is too great. Agent-based models (ABMs) provide an effective method of testing alternate management strategies without risk to livestock. ABMs are especially useful for modeling complex systems such as livestock grazing management, and allow for realistic bottom-up encoding of cattle behavior. Here, we introduce a spatially-explicit, behavior-based ABM of cattle grazing in a pasture with a dangerous amount of Geyer’s larkspur (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;geyeri&lt;/i&gt;). This model tests the role of herd cohesion and stocking density in larkspur intake, finds that both are key drivers of larkspur-induced toxicosis, and indicates that alteration of these factors within realistic bounds can mitigate risk. Crucially, the model points to herd cohesion, which has received little attention in the discipline, as playing an important role in lethal acute toxicosis. As the first ABM to model grazing behavior at realistic scales, this study also demonstrates the tremendous potential of ABMs to illuminate grazing management dynamics, including fundamental aspects of livestock behavior amidst ecological heterogeneity.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194450</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194450</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>An agent-based model of cattle grazing toxic Geyer&apos;s larkspur</title><fingerprint>7f50e94d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin E.

Our study provides a resource of genes that are promising candidates to exert specific, and novel, roles in neocortical development during primate, and notably human, evolution.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32332</link><published>1521590400000</published><title>Evolution and cell-type specificity of human-specific genes preferentially expressed in progenitors of fetal neocortex</title><fingerprint>2f1a578</fingerprint><keywords><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16248a2666c:3654e09:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521637025388</crawled><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32332</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5012032?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>Hong Zhou</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5012032?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5012032?af=R</link><published>1521438061000</published><title>Mechanism by which DHA inhibits the aggregation of KLVFFA peptides: A molecular dynamics study</title><fingerprint>d9d30fa4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/11&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 11&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1625704c351:4c87b81:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1521878352721</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0092867418303106%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D22f7117e7a565104c80a3952dacadae4</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/7051</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell, Volume 173, Issue 2&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Yao-Qing Chen, Teddy John Wohlbold, Nai-Ying Zheng, Min Huang, Yunping Huang, Karlynn E.

Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein specific for &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; and constitutes one of the three main protein antigens of the Bexsero vaccine. Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect. Moreover, we found that the C3-convertase of the alternative complement pathway is one of the proteases responsible for this processing. Overall, our data provide new insights on the cleavage of NHBA protein during meningococcal infection. NHBA cleavage may occur at different stages of the infection, and it likely has a different role depending on the environment the bacterium is interacting with.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194662</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194662</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen is targeted by the human alternative pathway C3-convertase</title><fingerprint>90dfc2a8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Di Fede, Massimiliano Biagini, Elena Cartocci, Carlo Parillo, Alessandra Greco, Manuele Martinelli, Sara Marchi, Alfredo Pezzicoli, Isabel Delany, Silvia Rossi Paccani&lt;/p&gt;

Large placental and birth weight, and fetal male sex were factors for a long cord, which again was associated with a doubled risk of intrauterine and perinatal death, and increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome. Anomalous cord insertion, female sex, and a small placenta were associated with a short cord, which was associated with increased risk of fetal malformations, placental complications, caesarean delivery, non-cephalic presentation, perinatal and intrauterine death. At term, cord knot was associated with a quadrupled risk of perinatal death. The combination of a cord knot and entanglement had a more than additive effect to the association to perinatal death. There was a more than doubled risk of recurrence of a long or short cord, knot and entanglement in a subsequent pregnancy of the same woman.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Cord length is influenced both by maternal and fetal factors, and there is increased risk of recurrence.

The catastrophic misinterpretation model of panic disorder (PD) predicts that the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations is a distinctive characteristic of PD. Existing research on this prediction has produced mixed findings. This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the strength of catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations and external events in patients with PD, patients with other anxiety disorders, and healthy controls. Following a systematic screening, seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. For the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations, analyses showed medium to large effects between patients with PD and healthy controls and between patients with PD and patients with other anxiety disorders. For the catastrophic misinterpretation of external events, analyses showed medium to large effects between patients with PD and healthy controls and a small negative effect between patients with PD and patients with other anxiety disorders. The findings support the assumption that the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations is a distinctive characteristic of panic disorder and thus lend support to the catastrophic misinterpretation model of PD.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194493</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194493</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>Catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations and external events in panic disorder, other anxiety disorders, and healthy subjects: A systematic review and meta-analysis</title><fingerprint>3a161bdd</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Barnabas Ohst, Brunna Tuschen-Caffier&lt;/p&gt;

Our human model of nasal colonization and eradication of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; is limited by safety issues. As rhesus macaques are closely related to humans and natural hosts for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;, we developed an experimental decolonization and inoculation protocol in these animals. Animals were screened for nasal carriage of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; and 20 carriers were selected. Decolonization was attempted using nasal mupirocin (10 animals) or mupirocin plus trimethoprim/sulfadiazine intramuscularly (10 animals) both once daily for 5 days, and checked by follow-up cultures for 10 weeks. Intranasal inoculation was performed with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; strain 8325–4 in culture-negative animals. 11/20 animals, of which 5 received mupirocin and 6 the combination treatment, became culture-negative for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; for 10 weeks and these 11 animals were subsequently inoculated. Swabs were taken once a week for 5 weeks to test for the presence of the inoculated strain. In 3 animals, strain 8325–4 was cultured from the nose 1 week after inoculation, indicating short-term survival of this strain only, a finding similar to that previously found in our human model. These data demonstrate that rhesus macaques may constitute a relevant animal model to perform &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; eradication and inoculation studies with relatively limited invasive handling of the animals.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194718</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194718</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>An experimental &amp;lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&amp;lt;/i&gt; carriage and decolonization model in rhesus macaques (&amp;lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><fingerprint>bd1894e1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bibi C.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming increasingly integrated into oncological practice and clinical research. NGS methods have also provided evidence for clonal evolution of cancers during disease progression and treatment. The number of variants associated with response to specific therapeutic agents keeps increasing. However, the identification of novel driver mutations as opposed to passenger (phenotypically silent or clinically irrelevant) mutations remains a major challenge. We conducted targeted exome sequencing of advanced solid tumors from 44 pre-treated patients with solid tumors including breast, colorectal and lung carcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomas and others. We catalogued established driver mutations and putative new drivers as predicted by two distinct algorithms. The established drivers we detected were consistent with published observations. However, we also detected a significant number of mutations with driver potential never described before in each tumor type we studied. These putative drivers belong to key cell fate regulatory networks, including potentially druggable pathways. Should our observations be confirmed, they would support the hypothesis that new driver mutations are selected by treatment in clinically aggressive tumors, and indicate a need for longitudinal genomic testing of solid tumors to inform second line cancer treatment.</description><engagement>1</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194790</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194790</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Novel putative drivers revealed by targeted exome sequencing of advanced solid tumors</title><fingerprint>a1491f56</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antonio Pannuti, Aleksandra Filipovic, Chindo Hicks, Elliot Lefkowitz, Travis Ptacek, Justin Stebbing, Lucio Miele&lt;/p&gt;

However, these artificial sensations do not yet provide the breadth of cutaneous and proprioceptive percepts available through natural stimulation. In a tetraplegic human with two microelectrode arrays implanted in S1, we report replicable elicitations of sensations in both the cutaneous and proprioceptive modalities localized to the contralateral arm, dependent on both amplitude and frequency of stimulation. Furthermore, we found a subset of electrodes that exhibited multimodal properties, and that proprioceptive percepts on these electrodes were associated with higher amplitudes, irrespective of the frequency. These novel results demonstrate the ability to provide naturalistic percepts through ICMS that can more closely mimic the body’s natural physiological capabilities.

In a tetraplegic human with two microelectrode arrays implanted in S1, we report replicable elicitations of sensations in both the cutaneous and proprioceptive modalities localized to the contralateral arm, dependent on both amplitude and frequency of stimulation. Furthermore, we found a subset of electrodes that exhibited multimodal properties, and that proprioceptive percepts on these electrodes were associated with higher amplitudes, irrespective of the frequency. These novel results demonstrate the ability to provide naturalistic percepts through ICMS that can more closely mimic the body’s natural physiological capabilities. Furthermore, delivering both cutaneous and proprioceptive sensations through artificial somatosensory feedback could improve performance and embodiment in brain-machine interfaces.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32904</link><published>1523318400000</published><title>Proprioceptive and cutaneous sensations in humans elicited by intracortical microstimulation</title><fingerprint>27fe9746</fingerprint><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162af52026b:1c292ea:923c4a60</id><crawled>1523359810155</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32904</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/45-g?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>Szuromi, P.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/45-g?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/45-g?rss=1</link><published>1522950073000</published><title>Layers for red luminescence</title><fingerprint>ea91a409</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/45.7.full</canonicalUrl><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a529836:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194833</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Nin-Chieh Hsu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nin-Chieh Hsu, Chun-Che Huang, Chin-Chung Shu, Ming-Chin Yang&lt;/p&gt;

A total of 21 SLAC/SLAH genes were identified from the five Rosaceae species.

Transcriptome data demonstrated that PbrSLAC/SLAH genes were detected in all parts of the pear. However, PbrSL AC1 showed a higher expression level in leaf, while PbrSLAH2/3 was mainly expressed in roots. In addition, PbrSLAC/SLAH genes were only located on the plasma membrane in transient expression experiments in Arabidopsis protoplasts cells.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. Controversies still exist over the relationship between hyponatremia and outcomes of hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To analyze the association of low serum sodium levels at hospital admission with in-hospital mortality and patient disposition and to compare the distribution of the risk of death associated with hyponatremia across the lifespan of hospitalized patients, we conducted an observational study of 2.3 million patients using data extracted from the Cerner Health Facts database between 2000 and 2014. Logistic regression models were used in the analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At hospital admission 14.4% of hospitalized patients had serum sodium levels [Na] &amp;lt;135 mEq/L. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, we found that the risk of in-hospital mortality significantly increases for [Na] levels &amp;lt; 135 or ≥143 to ≤145 mEq/L compared to the reference interval of 140 to &amp;lt;143 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001). We observed similar trends for the relationship between [Na] levels and discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility. We demonstrated that younger age groups (18 to &amp;lt;45, 45 to &amp;lt;65) had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared to older age groups (65 to &amp;lt;75, ≥75) for [Na] levels &amp;lt;130 mEq/L or 143 to ≤145 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is common among hospitalized patients and is significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To examine whether psychosocial work characteristics at age 45 years predict exit from the labour market by the age of 50 years in data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Psychosocial work characteristics (decision latitude, job demands, job strain and work social support at 45 years and job insecurity at 42 years) measured by questionnaire were linked to employment outcomes (unemployment, retirement, permanent sickness, homemaking) at 50 years in 6510 male and female participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Low decision latitude (RR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.06,3.79), low work social support (RR = 1.96, 95%CI 1.12,3.44), and high job insecurity (RR = 2.27, 95%CI 1.41, 3.67) predicted unemployment at 50, adjusting for sex, housing tenure, socioeconomic status, marital status, and education.

Background &lt;p&gt;Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a highly sensitive test for TB diagnosis, but still costly to most low-income countries. Several implementation strategies instead of frontline have been suggested; however with scarce data. We assessed accuracy of different Xpert MTB/RIF implementation strategies to inform national roll-out.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study of 1,924 adult presumptive TB patients in five regional referral hospitals of Uganda. Two sputum samples were collected, one for fluorescent microscopy (FM) and Xpert MTB/RIF examined at the study site laboratories. The second sample was sent to the Uganda Supra National TB reference laboratory for culture using both Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) and liquid culture (MGIT). We compared the sensitivities of FM, Xpert MTB/RIF and the incremental sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF among patients negative on FM using LJ and/or MGIT as a reference standard.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total 1924 patients were enrolled of which 1596 (83%) patients had at least one laboratory result and 1083 respondents had a complete set of all the laboratory results. A total of 328 (30%) were TB positive on LJ and /or MGIT culture. The sensitivity of FM was n (%; 95% confidence interval) 246 (63.5%; 57.9–68.7) overall compared to 52 (55.4%; 44.1–66.3) among HIV positive individuals, while the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 300 (76.2%; 71.7–80.7) and 69 (71.6%; 60.5–81.1) overall and among HIV positive individuals respectively. Overall incremental sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 60 (36.5%; 27.7–46.0) and 20 (41.7%; 25.5–59.2) among HIV positive individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Xpert MTB/RIF has a higher sensitivity than FM both in general population and HIV positive population. Xpert MTB/RIF offers a significant increase in terms of diagnostic sensitivity even when it is deployed selectively i.e. among smear negative presumptive TB patients. Our results support frontline use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in high HIV/TB prevalent countries.

The current literature suggests that most mRNAs are post-transcriptionally regulated in stressful conditions, we rationalized that the postmortem transcripts must contain sequence features (3 to 9 mers) that are unique from those in the rest of the transcriptome; specifically, binding sites for proteins and/or non-coding RNAs involved in regulation. Our new study identified 5117 and 2245 over-represented sequence features in the mouse and zebrafish, respectively. Some of these features were disproportionately distributed along the transcripts with high densities in the 3-UTR region of the zebrafish (0.3 mers/nt) and the ORFs of the mouse (0.6 mers/nt). Yet, the highest density (2.3 mers/nt) occurred in the ORFs of 11 mouse transcripts that lacked UTRs. Our results suggest that these transcripts might serve as molecular sponges that sequester RNA binding proteins and/or microRNAs, increasing the stability and gene expression of other transcripts. In addition, some features were identified as binding sites for Rbfox and Hud proteins that are also involved in increasing transcript stability and gene expression. Hence, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transcripts involved in responding to extreme stress have sequence features that make them different from the rest of the transcriptome, which presumably has implications for post-transcriptional regulation in disease, starvation, and cancer.</description><engagement>1</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293589v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293589v1?rss=1</link><published>1522652400000</published><title>Distinct sequence patterns in the active postmortem transcriptome [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>c60942e8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Our previous study found more than 500 transcripts significantly increased in abundance in the zebrafish and mouse several hours to days postmortem relative to live controls.

Hence, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transcripts involved in responding to extreme stress have sequence features that make them different from the rest of the transcriptome, which presumably has implications for post-transcriptional regulation in disease, starvation, and cancer.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/02/293589</canonicalUrl><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1628874c190:8ed1c44:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522707775888</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1479-b?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1479-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1479-b?rss=1</link><published>1522345097000</published><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>25a3aaf1</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1479.2.full</canonicalUrl><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c82:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><title>AAAS annual election: Preliminary announcement</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019209?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>Shuichiro Tsukamoto</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019209?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019209?af=R</link><published>1522379976000</published><title>Computational analysis for selectivity of histone deacetylase inhibitor by replica-exchange umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations</title><fingerprint>970a5e30</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1627af8ed58:7e93ece:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522481556824</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195978</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Peter Andriessen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Andriessen, Alex Zwanenburg, Judith O.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The inconclusive clinical results for ST-waveform analysis (STAN) in detecting fetal hypoxemia may be caused by the signal processing of the STAN-device itself. We assessed the performance of a clinical STAN device in signal processing and in detecting hypoxemia in a fetal sheep model exposed to prolonged umbilical cord occlusion (UCO).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight fetal lambs were exposed to 25 minutes of UCO. ECG recordings were analyzed during a baseline period and during UCO. STAN-event rates and timing of episodic T/QRS rise, baseline T/QRS rise and the occurrence of biphasic ST-waveforms, as well as signal loss, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During baseline conditions of normoxemia, a median of 40 (IQR, 25–70) STAN-events per minute were detected, compared to 10 (IQR, 2–22) during UCO. During UCO STAN-events were detected in five subjects within 10 minutes and in six subjects after 18 minutes, respectively. Two subjects did not generate any STAN-event during UCO. Biphasic ST event rate was reduced during UCO (median 0, IQR 0–5), compared to baseline (median 32, IQR, 6–55). ST-waveforms could not be assessed in 62% of the recording time during UCO, despite a good quality of the ECG signal.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The STAN device showed limitations in detecting hypoxemia in fetal sheep after prolonged UCO. The STAN device produced high false positive event rates during baseline and did not detect T/QRS changes adequately after prolonged fetal hypoxemia. During 14% of baseline and 62% of the UCO period, the STAN-device could not process the ECG signal, despite its good quality. Resolving these issues may improve the clinical performance of the STAN device.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195978</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195978</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>ST waveform analysis for monitoring hypoxic distress in fetal sheep after prolonged umbilical cord occlusion</title><fingerprint>be801b98</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Andriessen, Alex Zwanenburg, Judith O.

In the field of the social psychology of prejudice, John Duckitt&apos;s Dual-Process Cognitive-Motivational Model of Ideology and Prejudice has gained a firm grounding over the past decade and a half, while empathy has become one of the most powerful predictors of prejudice, alongside right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. This study integrates empathy into the dual-process model, exploring the effects of this variable, along with the impact of personality and ideological attitudes, on prejudice in both its blatant and subtle forms. A cross-sectional research design was used to collect data from 260 university students by self-report measures. Despite its cross-sectional nature, a pattern of causal relationships was hypothesized according to experimental and longitudinal findings from previous studies. The path analysis results show that in the model fitted to the data, empathy does not have any direct impact on prejudice, although it plays a significant role in the prediction of prejudice towards a particular immigrant group. On the other hand, the dual-process model is confirmed in the explanation of blatant prejudice and, in a weaker and indirect way, of subtle prejudice; sustaining the distinctive nature of these constructs on some differential predictors and paths. In the discussion, this study proposes that when ideological and personality-based variables are both included in the model, general empathy is not so robust in the explanation of prejudice, since some of the empathetic components might become diluted among other covariates. But even so, its indirect effectiveness through personality and ideological attitudes remains relevant.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195470</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195470</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Is empathy one of the Big Three?

The e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) consist of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and chemical additives for flavoring. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, and while some have been tested for toxicity in the laboratory, most have not. Here, we developed a 3-phase, 384-well, plate-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to rapidly triage and validate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids. Our data demonstrated that the PG/VG vehicle adversely affected cell viability and that a large number of e-liquids were more toxic than PG/VG. We also performed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on all tested e-liquids. Subsequent nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that e-liquids are an extremely heterogeneous group. Furthermore, these data indicated that (i) the more chemicals contained in an e-liquid, the more toxic it was likely to be and (ii) the presence of vanillin was associated with higher toxicity values. Further analysis of common constituents by electron ionization revealed that the concentration of cinnamaldehyde and vanillin, but not triacetin, correlated with toxicity. We have also developed a publicly available searchable website (www.eliquidinfo.org). Given the large numbers of available e-liquids, this website will serve as a resource to facilitate dissemination of this information. Our data suggest that an HTS approach to evaluate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids is feasible. Such an approach may serve as a roadmap to enable bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to better regulate e-liquid composition.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Djo1Z76O3OU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522184400000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162688d21d0:4b9326:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by M.

Identity-based proxy re-signature (IDPRS) is a novel cryptographic primitive that allows a semi-trusted proxy to convert a signature under one identity into another signature under another identity on the same message by using a re-signature key. Due to this transformation function, IDPRS is very useful in constructing privacy-preserving schemes for various information systems. Key revocation functionality is important in practical IDPRS for managing users dynamically; however, the existing IDPRS schemes do not provide revocation mechanisms that allow the removal of misbehaving or compromised users from the system. In this paper, we first introduce a notion called revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (RIDPRS) to achieve the revocation functionality. We provide a formal definition of RIDPRS as well as its security model. Then, we present a concrete RIDPRS scheme that can resist signing key exposure and prove that the proposed scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen identity and message attacks in the standard model. To further improve the performance of signature verification in RIDPRS, we introduce a notion called server-aided revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (SA-RIDPRS). Moreover, we extend the proposed RIDPRS scheme to the SA-RIDPRS scheme and prove that this extended scheme is secure against adaptive chosen message and collusion attacks. The analysis results show that our two schemes remain efficient in terms of computational complexity when implementing user revocation procedures. In particular, in the SA-RIDPRS scheme, the verifier needs to perform only a bilinear pairing and four exponentiation operations to verify the validity of the signature. Compared with other IDPRS schemes in the standard model, our SA-RIDPRS scheme greatly reduces the computation overhead of verification.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194783</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194783</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>Revocable identity-based proxy re-signature against signing key exposure</title><fingerprint>e3d68030</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaodong Yang, Chunlin Chen, Tingchun Ma, Jinli Wang, Caifen Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected (HIV+) persons have elevated risks for various manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD). No studies to our knowledge have compared atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) prevalence and associated characteristics for HIV+ persons and matched uninfected controls.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Persons with diagnoses of HIV receiving care at a large urban academic medical center were frequency-matched 1:2 on age, sex, race, zip code, and clinic location with uninfected persons. Possible AF/AFL was screened for using administrative codes and diagnoses of AF/AFL were subsequently adjudicated using electrocardiography and physician notes; adjudication was performed given the inconsistent validity of administrative code-derived AF diagnoses found in previous studies. There were 101 confirmed AF/AFL cases (2.00%) among 5,052 HIV+ patients and 159 confirmed AF/AFL cases (1.57%) among 10,121 uninfected controls [Odds Ratio (OR) 1.27, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.99–1.64; p = 0.056]. The association between HIV serostatus and AF/AFL was attenuated after adjustment for demographics and CVD risk factors. Among HIV+ persons, nadir CD4+ T cell count &amp;lt;200 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was associated with approximately twofold elevated odds of AF/AFL even after adjustment for demographics and CVD risk factors (Multivariable-adjusted OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.21–3.25). There was no significant association between log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; of peak HIV viral load and AF/AFL (Multivariable-adjusted OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86–1.24). Older age, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with similarly elevated odds of AF/AFL for HIV+ persons and uninfected controls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;HIV-related immunosuppression (nadir CD4 T cell count &amp;lt;200 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and traditional CVD risk factors are associated with significantly elevated odds of AF/AFL among HIV+ persons.

Chile pepper (&lt;i&gt;Capsicum annuum&lt;/i&gt;) is an important high valued crop worldwide, and when grown on a large scale has problems with weeds. One important herbicide used is glyphosate. Glyphosate inactivates the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (&lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt;), a key enzyme in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids. A transgenic approach towards making glyphosate resistant plants, entails introducing copies of a gene encoding for glyphosate-resistant EPSPS enzyme into the plant. The main objective of our work was to use an intragenic approach to confer resistance to glyphosate in chile which would require using only chile genes for transformation including the selectable marker. Tobacco was used as the transgenic system to identify different gene constructs that would allow for the development of the intragenic system for chile, since chile transformation is inefficient. An &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene was isolated from chile and mutagenized to introduce substitutions that are known to make the encoded enzyme resistant to glyphosate. The promoter for &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene was isolated from chile and the mutagenized chile &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; cDNA was engineered behind both the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter and the &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; promoter. The leaves from the transformants were checked for resistance to glyphosate using a cut leaf assay. In tobacco, though both gene constructs exhibited some degree of resistance to glyphosate, the construct with the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter was more effective and as such chile was transformed with this gene construct. The chile transformants showed resistance to low concentrations of glyphosate. Furthermore, preliminary studies showed that the mutated &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene driven by the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter could be used as a selectable marker for transformation. We have shown that an intragenic approach can be used to confer glyphosate-resistance in chile. However, we need a stronger chile promoter and a mutated chile gene that encodes for a more glyphosate resistant EPSPS protein.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194666</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194666</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>An intragenic approach to confer glyphosate resistance in chile (&amp;lt;i&gt;Capsicum annuum&amp;lt;/i&gt;) by introducing an &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; mutagenized chile &amp;lt;i&gt;EPSPS&amp;lt;/i&gt; gene encoding for a glyphosate resistant EPSPS protein</title><fingerprint>1b2d4174</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jose Luis Ortega, Wathsala Rajapakse, Suman Bagga, Kimberly Apodaca, Yvonne Lucero, Champa Sengupta-Gopalan&lt;/p&gt;

The promoter for &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene was isolated from chile and the mutagenized chile &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; cDNA was engineered behind both the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter and the &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; promoter. The leaves from the transformants were checked for resistance to glyphosate using a cut leaf assay. In tobacco, though both gene constructs exhibited some degree of resistance to glyphosate, the construct with the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter was more effective and as such chile was transformed with this gene construct. The chile transformants showed resistance to low concentrations of glyphosate. Furthermore, preliminary studies showed that the mutated &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene driven by the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter could be used as a selectable marker for transformation. We have shown that an intragenic approach can be used to confer glyphosate-resistance in chile. However, we need a stronger chile promoter and a mutated chile gene that encodes for a more glyphosate resistant EPSPS protein.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194666</canonicalUrl><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc712a:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193939</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Adam L.

Exposure to intense predation risk can induce morphological and behavioural phenotypes that prepare prey, often at young ages, for surviving attacks from unknown predators. However, previous studies revealed that this survival advantage depended on the predator species. Here, we used alarm cues from injured conspecifics to simulate a period of high predation risk for embryonic wood frogs, &lt;i&gt;Lithobates sylvaticus&lt;/i&gt;. Two weeks post-hatching, we tested whether the embryonic risk exposure influenced survival in encounters with two novel predators: (1) a spider (&lt;i&gt;Dolomedes&lt;/i&gt; sp.) that ambushes prey exclusively on the surface of the water, and (2) the adult predacious diving beetle (&lt;i&gt;Dytiscus&lt;/i&gt; sp.) which displays underwater sit-and-wait posture and pursuit tactics. Tadpoles exposed to embryonic high-risk survived longer when encountering spiders, whereas background risk had no influence on survival with adult beetles. These findings, coupled with survival studies involving other predator types, indicate that a high-risk environment promotes tadpole survival in future encounters with unknown sit-and-wait predators, but at the cost of increased vulnerability to novel predators capable of active pursuit.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193939</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193939</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>Embryonic background risk promotes the survival of tadpoles facing surface predators</title><fingerprint>9fd2586d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Adam L.

Cloud computing has revolutionized the development and operations of hardware and software across diverse technological arenas, yet academic biomedical research has lagged behind despite the numerous and weighty advantages that cloud computing offers. Biomedical researchers who embrace cloud computing can reap rewards in cost reduction, decreased development and maintenance workload, increased reproducibility, ease of sharing data and software, enhanced security, horizontal and vertical scalability, high availability, a thriving technology partner ecosystem, and much more. Despite these advantages that cloud-based workflows offer, the majority of scientific software developed in academia does not utilize cloud computing and must be migrated to the cloud by the user. In this article, we present 11 quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows on compute clouds, distilling knowledge gained from experience developing, operating, maintaining, and distributing software and virtualized appliances on the world’s largest cloud. Researchers who follow these tips stand to benefit immediately by migrating their workflows to cloud computing and embracing the paradigm of abstraction.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7tl3DiTInM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16272f1be07:b826c:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brian S.

Radiation-induced lung damage is an important treatment-related toxicity after lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). After implementing a tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co magnetic-resonance image guided system, ViewRay&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, we compared the associated early radiological lung density changes to those associated with a linear accelerator (LINAC). Eight patients treated with the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system were matched 1:1 with patients treated with LINAC. Prescription doses were 52 Gy or 60 Gy in four fractions, and lung dose-volumetric parameters were calculated from each planning system. The first two follow-up computed tomography (CT) were co-registered with the planning CT through deformable registration software, and lung density was measured by isodose levels. Tumor size was matched between the two groups, but the planning target volume of LINAC was larger than that of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036). With regard to clinically relevant dose-volumetric parameters in the lungs, the ipsilateral lung mean dose, &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10Gy&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;20Gy&lt;/sub&gt; were significantly poorer in tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co plans compared to LINAC plans (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, 0.036, and 0.017, respectively). Increased lung density was not observed in the first follow-up scan compared to the planning scan. A significant change of lung density was shown in the second follow-up scan and there was no meaningful difference between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for all dose regions. In addition, no patient developed clinical radiation pneumonitis until the second follow-up scan. Therefore, there was no significant difference in the early radiological lung damage between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for lung SABR despite of the inferior plan quality of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system compared to that of LINAC.

We investigate the influence of the visual appearance of a negotiator on persuasiveness within the context of negotiations. Psychological experiments were conducted to quantitatively analyze the relationship between visual appearance and the use of language. Male and female participants were shown three female and male photographs, respectively. They were asked to report how they felt about each photograph using a seven-point semantic differential (SD) scale for six affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness). Participants then answered how they felt about each negotiation scenario (they were presented with pictures and a situation combined with negotiation sentences) using a seven-point SD scale for seven affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, and degree of persuasion). Two experiments were conducted using different participant groups depending on the negotiation situations. Photographs with good or bad appearances were found to show high or low degrees of persuasion, respectively. A multiple regression equation was obtained, indicating the importance of the three language factors (euphemistic, honorific, and sympathy expressions) to impressions made during negotiation. The result shows that there are optimal negotiation sentences based on various negotiation factors, such as visual appearance and use of language. For example, persons with good appearance might worsen their impression during negotiations by using certain language, although their initial impression was positive, and persons with bad appearance could effectively improve their impressions in negotiations through their use of language, although the final impressions of their negotiation counterpart might still be more negative than those for persons with good appearance. In contrast, the impressions made by persons of normal appearance were not easily affected by their use of language. The results of the present study have significant implications for future studies of effective negotiation strategies considering visual appearance as well as gender.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195496</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195496</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Optimal linguistic expression in negotiations depends on visual appearance</title><fingerprint>c300347c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maki Sakamoto, Jinhwan Kwon, Hikaru Tamada, Yumi Hirahara&lt;/p&gt;

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-1 family with multiple context dependent functions. We and others have shown that HIV infection is accompanied by increased circulating levels of IL-18 along with decreased levels of its antagonist, Interleukin-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP). The infection is also accompanied by intestinal inflammation and decreased intestinal integrity as measured by intestinal permeability, regeneration and repair. However, little is known concerning the relation between high level of IL-18 associated with the viral infection and intestinal permeability. Here we demonstrate that HIV treatment increases production of IL-18 and decreases that of IL-18BP production in human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines. IL-18 causes apoptosis of the IEC by activating caspase-1 and caspase-3. It induces epithelial barrier hyperpermeability by decreasing and disrupting both tight and adherens junction proteins, occludin, claudin 2 and beta-catenin. Disorganization of F-actin was also observed in the IEC that were exposed to the cytokine. Moreover IL-18 decreases transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in Caco-2 and increases permeability in HT29 monolayers. The cells’ treatment with IL-18 causes an increase in the expression of phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light-chain (p-MLC) and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and a decrease in phosphorylated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (p-STAT)-5. This increase in p-MLC is suppressed by a Rho-kinase (ROCK)-specific inhibitor. Interestingly, the levels of the cytokine correlate with those of LPS in the circulation in three different categories of HIV infected patients (HAART-naïve and HAART-treated HIV-infected individuals, and Elite controls) as well as in healthy controls. Collectively, these results suggest that the HIV-induced IL-18 plays a role in increased intestinal permeability and microbial translocation observed in HIV-infected individuals.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194185</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194185</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>HIV induces production of IL-18 from intestinal epithelial cells that increases intestinal permeability and microbial translocation</title><fingerprint>cb164de5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ossama Allam, Suzanne Samarani, Vikram Mehraj, Mohammad-Ali Jenabian, Cecile Tremblay, Jean-Pierre Routy, Devendra Amre, Ali Ahmad&lt;/p&gt;

When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6W0_cn-RZQs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522184400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162688e2a3c:4d824:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiva Farashahi, Chih-Chung Ting, Chang-Hao Kao, Shih-Wei Wu, Alireza Soltani&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Concerns regarding vaccine safety are increasing along with lack of compliance to vaccination schedules. This study aimed to assess vaccination-related risks and the impact of a Special Immunization Service (SIS) at the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) of Padua on vaccination compliance among participants.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study included all children attending the SIS from January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2002 to December 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2015. The Service is divided into a clinic (SIS-C) where all referred children undergo a pre-vaccination visit and an area within the Pediatric Emergency Department (SIS-PED) where children are vaccinated if indicated. During each SIS-C visit, age, gender, admission criteria and scheduled vaccinations were recorded, with any vaccine-related adverse events captured during SIS-PED visits. Follow-up was conducted to evaluate vaccination plan completion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;359 children received 560 vaccine administrations (41.3% MMR/MMRV, 17.5% hexavalent) at the SIS during the 14 year study.

Background &lt;p&gt;Concerns regarding vaccine safety are increasing along with lack of compliance to vaccination schedules. This study aimed to assess vaccination-related risks and the impact of a Special Immunization Service (SIS) at the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) of Padua on vaccination compliance among participants.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study included all children attending the SIS from January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2002 to December 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2015. The Service is divided into a clinic (SIS-C) where all referred children undergo a pre-vaccination visit and an area within the Pediatric Emergency Department (SIS-PED) where children are vaccinated if indicated. During each SIS-C visit, age, gender, admission criteria and scheduled vaccinations were recorded, with any vaccine-related adverse events captured during SIS-PED visits. Follow-up was conducted to evaluate vaccination plan completion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;359 children received 560 vaccine administrations (41.3% MMR/MMRV, 17.5% hexavalent) at the SIS during the 14 year study. Admission criteria were adverse events after previous vaccination (immediate, IgE/not IgE mediated, and late) in 27.2% of cases, non-anaphylactic allergies (mostly egg allergy) in 42.7% and anaphylaxis in 10.3%. After vaccination, 15/560 (2.7%) mild adverse events were observed. 96.3% of children vaccinated at least once at the SIS-PED and available for follow-up completed their vaccination plan, in contrast to 55.5% of children referred to the SIS-C who were not vaccinated in SIS-PED.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For children referred to SIS-C and available for follow-up, vaccination in SIS-PED was associated with more frequent completion of vaccination plans, indicating a benefit of the service to vaccine coverage.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine the factors associated with gait parameters in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The gait analysis was performed in a large cohort of RA patients, and three basic gait parameters (step length, cadence and gait speed) were calculated. Clinical and laboratory data were also collected. Factors associated with gait parameters were analyzed using multivariable linear regression in the three models with forced entry.

Knee extension strength had the strongest positive association with all three gait parameters (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), while methotrexate use was also positively associated with all three gait parameters (step length: P &amp;lt; 0.05, cadence: P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 3, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01). The disease activity score was negatively associated with step length and gait speed (step length, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 3). 26% of patients with good HAQ scores showed slow gait speed. Patients with good HAQ scores and slow gait speed had higher disease activity scores (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and lower knee extension strength (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) than those with good HAQ scores and normal gait speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;High knee extension strength, low disease activity and administration of methotrexate were strongly associated with good walking ability in female patients with RA.

The mechanical environment is a primary factor in the success of distraction osteogenesis. It is known that the interfragmentary movement during the distraction and maturation phase effects the callus formation. In addition to cyclic compression, other movements like shear and bending influence the bone formation process as shown in previous callus distraction studies.

The mechanical environment is a primary factor in the success of distraction osteogenesis. It is known that the interfragmentary movement during the distraction and maturation phase effects the callus formation. In addition to cyclic compression, other movements like shear and bending influence the bone formation process as shown in previous callus distraction studies. Reports of cartilage presence and endochondral ossification in the regenerative zone have been associated with a lack of fixation stability and delayed healing. So far the effects of the direction of interfragmentary movements could not be studied separately. By means of a unique lateral callus distraction model, we investigated the effects of small (0.1 mm) and moderate (0.6 mm), purely axial compression on ossification during callus maturation in sheep.

The incidence of cancers attributable to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) that affect males is on the rise. Currently in the UK teenage boys are not vaccinated against HPV while teenage girls are. The rationale for not vaccinating boys is that vaccinating girls should provide herd immunity to boys, however this does not protect men who have sex with men or men who have sex with unvaccinated women. The issue of whether to vaccinate boys or not is a controversial one with considerable lobbying taking place to change the existing policy. On one side of the debate are financial considerations while on the other side health equality is important. One avenue that has not been presented is the parental perspective. The current study uses a self-report questionnaire to explore what parents of teenage boys know about HPV and the vaccine and whether they want the vaccine for their sons. Only half of the parents had heard of HPV prior to completing the survey. Of those who had heard of HPV, knowledge about the health sequelae of HPV for men was poor relative to their knowledge about its impact on female health. Parents who would be willing to vaccinate their sons had higher levels of knowledge about HPV than those parents who would be unwilling or unsure. Irrespective of whether they had previously heard of HPV or not, once provided with a brief description of HPV, the majority of parents thought that boys should be offered the vaccination. There is a pressing need for public education about the potential impact of HPV on male health in order to facilitate uptake of the vaccine in the event of the vaccination programme being extended to men or to facilitate informed decision making about seeking the vaccine privately in the event that it isn’t.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195801</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195801</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Attitudes towards and knowledge about Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and the HPV vaccination in parents of teenage boys in the UK</title><fingerprint>b7dd58cc</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susan Mary Sherman, Emma Nailer&lt;/p&gt;

Hyperopia is a common refractive error, apparent in 25% of Europeans. Treatments include spectacles, contact lenses, laser interventions and surgery including implantable contact lenses and lens extraction. Laser treatment offers an expedient and reliable means of correcting ametropia. LASIK is well-established however SMILE (small-incision lenticule extraction) or lenticule implantation (derived from myopic laser-correction) are newer options. In this study we compared the outcomes of hyperopic LASIK, SMILE and lenticule re-implantation in a primate model at +2D/+4D treatment. While re-implantation showed the greatest regression, broadly comparable refractive results were seen at 3-months with SMILE and LASIK (&amp;lt;1.4D of intended), but a greater tendency to regression in +2D lenticule reimplantation. Central corneal thickness showed greater variation at +2D treatment, but central thickening during lenticule reimplantation at +4D treatment was seen (-17± 27μm LASIK, -45 ± 18μm SMILE and 28 ± 17μm Re-implantation; p &amp;lt;0.01) with expected paracentral thinning following SMILE. Although in vivo confocal microscopy appeared to show higher reflectivity in all +4D treatment groups, there were minimal and inconsistent changes in inflammatory responses between modalities. SMILE and lenticule re-implantation may represent a safe and viable method for treating hyperopia, but further optimization for lower hyperopic treatments is warranted.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Hyperopic refractive correction by LASIK, SMILE or lenticule reimplantation in a non-human primate model</title><fingerprint>11fd5c8c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Geraint P.

Central corneal thickness showed greater variation at +2D treatment, but central thickening during lenticule reimplantation at +4D treatment was seen (-17± 27μm LASIK, -45 ± 18μm SMILE and 28 ± 17μm Re-implantation; p &amp;lt;0.01) with expected paracentral thinning following SMILE. Although in vivo confocal microscopy appeared to show higher reflectivity in all +4D treatment groups, there were minimal and inconsistent changes in inflammatory responses between modalities. SMILE and lenticule re-implantation may represent a safe and viable method for treating hyperopia, but further optimization for lower hyperopic treatments is warranted.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</canonicalUrl><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2815:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23838-w</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Ksander N. de Winkel</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Causal Inference in the Perception of Verticality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causal Inference in the Perception of Verticality, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23838-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23838-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Causal Inference in the Perception of Verticality&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/kjxl_eP-k3o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23838-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/kjxl_eP-k3o/s41598-018-23838-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23838-w</link><published>1522738800000</published><title>Causal Inference in the Perception of Verticality</title><fingerprint>4578fda1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Causal Inference in the Perception of Verticality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causal Inference in the Perception of Verticality, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23838-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23838-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Causal Inference in the Perception of Verticality&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/kjxl_eP-k3o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1628acdc610:9385a95:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23838-w/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23838_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>654</width><height>685</height></visual><crawled>1522747164176</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01073</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Eric J.

Early diagnosis is critical for individuals with Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) in clinical practice because its progress is irreversible. In the existing literature, support vector machine (SVM) has always been applied to distinguish between AD and healthy controls (HC) based on neuroimaging data. But previous studies have only used a single SVM to classify AD and HC, and the accuracy is not very high and generally less than 90%. The method of random support vector machine cluster was proposed to classify AD and HC in this paper. From the Alzheimer&apos;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the subjects including 25 AD individuals and 35 HC individuals were obtained. The classification accuracy could reach to 94.44% in the results. Furthermore, the method could also be used for feature selection and the accuracy could be maintained at the level of 94.44%. In addition, we could also find out abnormal brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and cingulate cortex). It is worth noting that the proposed random support vector machine cluster could be a new insight to help the diagnosis of AD.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194479</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194479</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Random support vector machine cluster analysis of resting-state fMRI in Alzheimer&apos;s disease</title><fingerprint>5f2d5fed</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xia-an Bi, Qing Shu, Qi Sun, Qian Xu&lt;/p&gt;

However, the quality of any prediction based on molecular dynamics results will strongly depend on the validity of underlying physical assumptions.
Unphysical behavior of simulations can have significant influence on the results and reproducibility of these simulations, such as folding of proteins and DNA or properties of lipid bilayers determined by cutoff treatment, dynamics of peptides and polymers affected by the choice of thermostat, or liquid properties depending on the simulation time step. Motivated by such examples, we propose a two-fold approach to increase the robustness of molecular simulations. The first part of this approach involves tests which can be performed by the users of MD programs on their respective systems and setups. We present a number of tests of different complexity, ranging from simple post-processing analysis to more involved tests requiring additional simulations. These tests are shown to significantly increase the reliability of MD simulations by catching a number of common simulation errors violating physical assumptions, such as non-conservative integrators, deviations from the Boltzmann ensemble, and lack of ergodicity between degrees of freedom. To make the usage as easy as possible, we have developed an open-source and platform-independent Python library (https://physical-validation.readthedocs.io) implementing these tests.
The second part of the approach involves testing for code correctness. While unphysical behavior can be due to poor or incompatible choices of parameters by the user, it can just as well originate in coding errors within the program. We therefore propose to include physical validation tests in the code-checking mechanism of MD software packages. We have implemented such a validation for the GROMACS software package, ensuring that every major releases passes a number of physical sanity checks performed on selected representative systems before shipping. It is, to our knowledge, the first major molecular mechanics software package to run such validation routinely. The tests are, as the rest of the package, open source software, and can be adapted for other software packages.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Testing_for_Physical_Validity_in_Molecular_Simulations/6005279</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Advances in recent years have made molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations powerful tools in molecular-level research, allowing the prediction of experimental observables in the study of systems such as proteins, membranes, and polymeric materials. However, the quality of any prediction based on molecular dynamics results will strongly depend on the validity of underlying physical assumptions.
Unphysical behavior of simulations can have significant influence on the results and reproducibility of these simulations, such as folding of proteins and DNA or properties of lipid bilayers determined by cutoff treatment, dynamics of peptides and polymers affected by the choice of thermostat, or liquid properties depending on the simulation time step. Motivated by such examples, we propose a two-fold approach to increase the robustness of molecular simulations. The first part of this approach involves tests which can be performed by the users of MD programs on their respective systems and setups.

Animal welfare requires the adequate housing of animals to ensure health and well-being. The application of environmental enrichment is a way to improve the well-being of laboratory animals. However, it is important to know whether these enrichment items can be incorporated in experimental mouse husbandry without creating a divide between past and future experimental results. Previous small-scale studies have been inconsistent throughout the literature, and it is not yet completely understood whether and how enrichment might endanger comparability of results of scientific experiments. Here, we measured the effect on means and variability of 164 physiological parameters in 3 conditions: with nesting material with or without a shelter, comparing these 2 conditions to a “barren” regime without any enrichments. We studied a total of 360 mice from each of 2 mouse strains (C57BL/6NTac and DBA/2NCrl) and both sexes for each of the 3 conditions. Our study indicates that enrichment affects the mean values of some of the 164 parameters with no consistent effects on variability. However, the influence of enrichment appears negligible compared to the effects of other influencing factors. Therefore, nesting material and shelters may be used to improve animal welfare without impairment of experimental outcome or loss of comparability to previous data collected under barren housing conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Dd6wtkaJG8Q&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162cf7703c6:e8c8c5:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viola André, Christine Gau, Angelika Scheideler, Juan A.

The fornicata (fornicates) is a eukaryotic group known to consist of free-living and parasitic organisms. Genome datasets of two model fornicate parasites &lt;i&gt;Giardia intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Spironucleus salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are well annotated, so far. The nuclear genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; assemblages and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are small in terms of the genome size and simple in genome structure. However, an ancestral genomic structure and gene contents, from which genomes of the fornicate parasites have evolved, remains to be clarified. In order to understand genome evolution in fornicates, here, we present the draft genome sequence of a free-living fornicate, &lt;i&gt;Kipferlia bialata&lt;/i&gt;, the divergence of which is earlier than those of the fornicate parasites, and compare it to the genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt;. Our data show that the number of protein genes and introns in &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; genome are the most abundant in the genomes of three fornicates, reflecting an ancestral state of fornicate genome evolution. Evasion mechanisms of host immunity found in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are absent in the &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; genome, suggesting that the two parasites acquired the complex membrane surface proteins on the line leading to the common ancestor of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; after the divergence from &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt;.

Sepsis is characterized by an intense systemic inflammatory response activating a cascade of proinflammatory events resulting in leukocyte dysregulation and host tissue damage. The lung is particularly susceptible to systemic inflammation, leading to acute lung injury. Key to inflammation-induced lung damage is the excessive migration of neutrophils across the vascular endothelium. The mechanisms which regulate neutrophil activation and migration in sepsis are not well defined but there is growing evidence that platelets are actively involved and play a key role in microvascular permeability and neutrophil-mediated organ damage. We previously identified PKC-delta (PKCδ) as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response in sepsis and demonstrated PKCδ inhibition was lung protective. However, the role of PKCδ in sepsis-induced platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interactions is not known. In this study, rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Following surgeries, a PKCδ inhibitor (200μg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was administered intra-tracheally. At 24 hours post-surgeries, lung tissue, BAL fluid, and blood samples were collected. While sepsis caused thrombocytopenia, the remaining circulating platelets were activated as demonstrated by increased p-selectin expression, elevated plasma PF4, and enhanced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation compared to Sham animals. Platelet activation was associated with increased platelet PKCδ activity. Inhibition of PKCδ attenuated sepsis-induced platelet activation, secretion and aggregate formation. Sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia was also significantly reduced and circulating platelet numbers were similar to sham animals. In the lung, sepsis induced significant influx of platelets and neutrophils and the development of lung injury. Administration of the PKCδ inhibitor decreased platelet and neutrophil influx, and was lung protective. Thus, PKCδ inhibition modulated platelet activity both locally and systemically, decreased neutrophil influx into the lung, and was lung protective. We demonstrate for the first time that PKCδ plays an important role in platelet activation and platelet-neutrophil interaction during sepsis.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195379</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195379</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>Role of Protein Kinase C-delta in regulating platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interaction during sepsis</title><fingerprint>386aa806</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elisabetta Liverani, Mark J.

Administration of the PKCδ inhibitor decreased platelet and neutrophil influx, and was lung protective. Thus, PKCδ inhibition modulated platelet activity both locally and systemically, decreased neutrophil influx into the lung, and was lung protective. We demonstrate for the first time that PKCδ plays an important role in platelet activation and platelet-neutrophil interaction during sepsis.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195379</canonicalUrl><updated>1522875600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575fe:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03810-y</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Liang Wang</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03810-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/MVWoBiFPQvM/s41467-018-03810-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03810-y</link><published>1523343600000</published><title>Single-site catalyst promoters accelerate metal-catalyzed nitroarene hydrogenation</title><fingerprint>54345b5d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Single-site catalyst promoters accelerate metal-catalyzed nitroarene hydrogenation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-site catalyst promoters accelerate metal-catalyzed nitroarene hydrogenation, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03810-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03810-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Understanding of the structures and roles of catalyst promoters markedly lags behind the understanding of the structures and roles of catalytic sites.

The cause of early metastatic relapse in breast cancer has long been debated, with many ascribing these relapses to the natural progression of the disease. Others have proposed that some aspect of surgical tumor resection triggers the outgrowth of otherwise-dormant metastases, leading to the synchronous pattern of relapse. Clinical data cannot distinguish between these hypotheses, and previous experimental approaches have not provided clear answers. Such uncertainty hinders the development and application of therapeutic approaches that could potentially reduce early metastatic relapse. We describe an experimental model system that definitively links surgery and the subsequent wound-healing response to the outgrowth of tumor cells at distant anatomical sites. Specifically, we find that the systemic inflammatory response induced after surgery promotes the emergence of tumors whose growth was otherwise restricted by a tumor-specific T cell response. Furthermore, we demonstrate that perioperative anti-inflammatory treatment markedly reduces tumor outgrowth in this model, suggesting that similar approaches might substantially reduce early metastatic recurrence in breast cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>152</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/436/eaan3464?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/436/eaan3464?rss=1</link><published>1523469025000</published><title>[Research Articles] The systemic response to surgery triggers the outgrowth of distant immune-controlled tumors in mouse models of dormancy</title><fingerprint>a065572</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Patients undergoing surgical resection of primary breast tumors confront a risk for metastatic recurrence that peaks sharply 12 to 18 months after surgery.

Background &lt;p&gt;The treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease remains controversial. Recently, the PLEASE study did not demonstrate any additional clinical benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic treatment. However, the economic impact of the antibiotic strategies has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective economic evaluation, adhering a societal perspective, was performed alongside the PLEASE study, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 1:1:1 randomized clinical trial in which all patients received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks before the 12-week randomized blinded oral antibiotic regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Between 2010 and 2013, patients (n = 271) with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms were enrolled and followed for one year. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental net monetary benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean quality-adjusted life years (95% CI) were not significantly different (p = 0.96): 0.82 (0.77–0.88) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline (n = 82), 0.81 (0.76–0.88) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine (n = 93), and 0.81 (0.76–0.86) for ceftriaxone/placebo (n = 96). Total societal costs per patient (95% CI) were not significantly different either (p = 0.35): €11,995 (€8,823-€15,670) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline, €12,202 (€9,572-€15,253) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, and €15,249 (€11,294-€19,781) for ceftriaxone/placebo. Incremental net monetary benefit (95% CI) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline compared to ceftriaxone/placebo varied from €3,317 (-€2,199-€8,998) to €4,285 (-€6,085-€14,524) over the willingness-to-pay range, and that of ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine compared to ceftriaxone/placebo from €3,098 (-€888-€7,172) to €3,710 (-€4,254-€11,651). For every willingness-to-pay threshold, the incremental net monetary benefits did not significantly differ from zero.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The longer-term treatments were similar with regard to costs, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared to shorter-term treatment in patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms after one year of follow-up.

We investigated the effect of auditory noise added to speech on patterns of looking at faces in 40 toddlers. We hypothesised that noise would increase the difficulty of processing speech, making children allocate more attention to the mouth of the speaker to gain visual speech cues from mouth movements. We also hypothesised that this shift would cause a decrease in fixation time to the eyes, potentially decreasing the ability to monitor gaze. We found that adding noise increased the number of fixations to the mouth area, at the price of a decreased number of fixations to the eyes. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a mouth-eyes trade-off between attention allocated to social cues coming from the eyes and linguistic cues coming from the mouth.

We investigated the effect of auditory noise added to speech on patterns of looking at faces in 40 toddlers. We hypothesised that noise would increase the difficulty of processing speech, making children allocate more attention to the mouth of the speaker to gain visual speech cues from mouth movements. We also hypothesised that this shift would cause a decrease in fixation time to the eyes, potentially decreasing the ability to monitor gaze. We found that adding noise increased the number of fixations to the mouth area, at the price of a decreased number of fixations to the eyes. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a mouth-eyes trade-off between attention allocated to social cues coming from the eyes and linguistic cues coming from the mouth. We also found that children with higher word recognition proficiency and higher average pupil response had an increased likelihood of fixating the mouth, compared to the eyes and the rest of the screen, indicating stronger motivation to decode the speech.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194491</canonicalUrl><updated>1521579600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37ab:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195829</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Bing Feng</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bing Feng, Soojin V.

The co-existence of several ploidy types in natural populations makes the cyprinid loach &lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; an exciting model system to study the genetic and phenotypic consequences of ploidy variations. A first step in such effort is to identify the specific ploidy of an individual. Currently popular methods of karyotyping via cytological preparation or flow cytometry require a large amount of tissue (such as blood) samples, which can be damaging or fatal to the fishes. Here, we developed novel microsatellite markers (SSR markers) from &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; and show that they can effectively discriminate ploidy using samples collected in a minimally invasive way. Specifically, we generated whole genome transcriptomes from multiple &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; using the Illumina paired-end sequencing. Approximately 150 million raw reads were assembled into 76,544 non-redundant unigenes. A total of 8,194 potential SSR markers were identified. We selected 98 pairs with more than five tandem repeats for further assays. Out of 45 putative EST-SSR markers that successfully amplified and harbored polymorphism in diploids, 11 markers displayed high variability in tetraploids. We further demonstrate that a set of five EST-SSR markers selected from these are sufficient to distinguish ploidy levels, by first validating them on 69 reference specimens with known ploidy levels and then subsequently using fresh-collected 96 ploidy-unknown specimens. The results from EST-SSR markers are highly concordant with those from independent flow cytometry analysis. The novel EST-SSR markers developed here should facilitate genetic studies of polyploidy in the emerging model system &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt;.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195829</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195829</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Development of novel EST-SSR markers for ploidy identification based on &amp;lt;i&gt;de novo&amp;lt;/i&gt; transcriptome assembly for &amp;lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>98eba322</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bing Feng, Soojin V.

In face-to-face social interactions, blind and visually impaired persons (VIPs) lack access to nonverbal cues like facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, which may lead to impaired interpersonal communication. In this study, a wearable sensory substitution device (SSD) consisting of a head mounted camera and a haptic belt was evaluated to determine whether vibrotactile cues around the waist could be used to convey facial expressions to users and whether such a device is desired by VIPs for use in daily living situations. Ten VIPs (mean age: 38.8, SD: 14.4) and 10 sighted persons (SPs) (mean age: 44.5, SD: 19.6) participated in the study, in which validated sets of pictures, silent videos, and videos with audio of facial expressions were presented to the participant. A control measurement was first performed to determine how accurately participants could identify facial expressions while relying on their functional senses. After a short training, participants were asked to determine facial expressions while wearing the emotion feedback system. VIPs using the device showed significant improvements in their ability to determine which facial expressions were shown. A significant increase in accuracy of 44.4% was found across all types of stimuli when comparing the scores of the control (mean±SEM: 35.0±2.5%) and supported (mean±SEM: 79.4±2.1%) phases. The greatest improvements achieved with the support of the SSD were found for silent stimuli (68.3% for pictures and 50.8% for silent videos). SPs also showed consistent, though not statistically significant, improvements while supported. Overall, our study shows that vibrotactile cues are well suited to convey facial expressions to VIPs in real-time. Participants became skilled with the device after a short training session. Further testing and development of the SSD is required to improve its accuracy and aesthetics for potential daily use.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194737</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194737</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Conveying facial expressions to blind and visually impaired persons through a wearable vibrotactile device</title><fingerprint>c0ef7590</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hendrik P.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Using our previously developed and tested Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Stigma Scale, we investigated factors associated with perceived SRH stigma among adolescent girls in Ghana.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We drew upon data from our survey study of 1,063 females 15-24yrs recruited from community- and clinic-based sites in two Ghanaian cities. Our Adolescent SRH Stigma Scale comprised 20 items and 3 sub-scales (Internalized, Enacted, Lay Attitudes) to measure stigma occurring with sexual activity, contraceptive use, pregnancy, abortion and family planning service use. We assessed relationships between a comprehensive set of demographic, health and social factors and SRH Stigma with multi-level multivariable linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In unadjusted bivariate analyses, compared to their counterparts, SRH stigma scores were higher among girls who were younger, Accra residents, Muslim, still in/dropped out of secondary school, unemployed, reporting excellent/very good health, not in a relationship, not sexually experienced, never received family planning services, never used contraception, but had been pregnant (all p-values &amp;lt;0.05). In multivariable models, higher SRH stigma scores were associated with history of pregnancy (β = 1.53, CI = 0.51,2.56) and excellent/very good self-rated health (β = 0.89, CI = 0.20,1.58), while lower stigma scores were associated with older age (β = -0.17, 95%CI = -0.24,-0.09), higher educational attainment (β = -1.22, CI = -1.82,-0.63), and sexual intercourse experience (β = -1.32, CI = -2.10,-0.55).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings provide insight into factors contributing to SRH stigma among this young Ghanaian female sample. Further research disentangling the complex interrelationships between SRH stigma, health, and social context is needed to guide multi-level interventions to address SRH stigma and its causes and consequences for adolescents worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195163</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195163</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>Factors associated with sexual and reproductive health stigma among adolescent girls in Ghana</title><fingerprint>433a030a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kelli Stidham Hall, Emmanuel Morhe, Abubakar Manu, Lisa H.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the number of studies that have tried to demonstrate that there is an association between previous falls and the fear of falling, the relationship between these two variables remains a matter of controversy.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our objective was to investigate whether the fear of falling is a cause of falls, a consequence, or both in community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 75 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A descriptive, longitudinal, prospective study was performed. A total of 640 individuals were interviewed between 2009 and 2011. Sociodemographic data, health status, history of falls and fear of falling were assessed at baseline and at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of falls at baseline was 25% as opposed to 35.2% at 24 months. The prevalence of the fear of falling was 41.5% at baseline. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between a history of falls and the fear of falling. Other factors associated with the fear of falling were female gender, comorbidity, depressive symptoms, and disability. In total, 41.7% of the subjects who had reported a fear of falling at baseline had suffered at least one fall 24 months later. Unadjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that the fear of falling was a risk factor for falls.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the number of studies that have tried to demonstrate that there is an association between previous falls and the fear of falling, the relationship between these two variables remains a matter of controversy.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our objective was to investigate whether the fear of falling is a cause of falls, a consequence, or both in community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 75 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A descriptive, longitudinal, prospective study was performed. A total of 640 individuals were interviewed between 2009 and 2011. Sociodemographic data, health status, history of falls and fear of falling were assessed at baseline and at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of falls at baseline was 25% as opposed to 35.2% at 24 months. The prevalence of the fear of falling was 41.5% at baseline. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between a history of falls and the fear of falling. Other factors associated with the fear of falling were female gender, comorbidity, depressive symptoms, and disability. In total, 41.7% of the subjects who had reported a fear of falling at baseline had suffered at least one fall 24 months later.

&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; is a protozoon parasite that causes congenital toxoplasmosis, as well as other serious clinical presentations, in immune compromised humans. Analyses of the prevalence and genotyping of strains from the definitive host and intermediate hosts will help to understanding the circulation of the different strains and elucidating the role of the genotype(s) in human toxoplasmosis. Turkey has a specific geographic location bridging Africa, Europe, and Asia. We hypothesized that &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains may have been transferred to Turkey from these continents via migratory birds or vice versa. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in wild birds of prey of İzmir and Manisa provinces as well as genetically characterize &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains from these wild birds to show the relation between bird strains and neighboring stray cats as well as human strains previously isolated in Turkey. Tissues obtained from 48 wild birds were investigated for the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA and then bioassayed in mouse. Isolated strains were genotyped using 15 microsatellite markers. The prevalence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA was found to be 89.6% (n: 43/48) in wild birds. Out of 43 positive samples, a total of 14 strains were genotyped by 15 microsatellite markers. Among them, eight were type II, three were type III and three were mixture of genotypes (two type II/II and one was II/III). These are the first data that showed the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; and types II and III genotypes in wild birds of Turkey. Moreover, Africa 1 was not detected. In addition, cluster analysis showed that &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains within type II and III lineage have close relation with strains previously isolated from stray cats in İzmir. Further studies are required to isolate more strains from human cases, other intermediate hosts, and water sources to reveal this relation.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196159</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196159</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>Prevalence of toxoplasmosis and genetic characterization of &amp;lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&amp;lt;/i&gt; strains isolated in wild birds of prey and their relation with previously isolated strains from Turkey</title><fingerprint>cb4ccfc2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammet Karakavuk, Duygu Aldemir, Aurélien Mercier, Esra Atalay Şahar, Hüseyin Can, Jean-Benjamin Murat, Ömer Döndüren, Şengül Can, Hüseyin Gökhan Özdemir, Aysu Değirmenci Döşkaya, Bayram Pektaş, Marie-Laure Dardé, Adnan Yüksel Gürüz, Mert Döşkaya&lt;/p&gt;

We evaluated the feasibility and safety of nictitating membrane fixation to address reduced contact lens stability by the nictitating membrane in a rabbit model. Under general anesthesia, twelve animals received a horizontal mattress suture between the nictitating membrane and the upper eyelid of one eye. To assess the effects of this technique and secondary side effects, contact lens stability test, Schirmer tear test, tear break-up time measurement, eye tissue pathology and morphology were evaluated. Contact lens stability was increased after nictitating membrane fixation. The percentage of contact lens retention in the nictitating membrane fixed rabbit after 4 hours was 90% whereas that in the untreated rabbit was 42.5%. In addition, there were no significant differences in tear quantity and quality between the fixed and untreated eyes. Furthermore, no remarkable pathological lesions were found in gross observation during the 1-month time period or the following pathological examination. In this study, we demonstrated that nictitating membrane fixation increases contact lens stability without specific side effects using a rabbit model. This minimally invasive procedure could be useful when designing animal models for testing new contact lenses and has potential to apply to other biomaterial research on the ocular surface.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194795</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194795</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Nictitating membrane fixation improves stability of the contact lens on the animal corneal surface</title><fingerprint>bfc59809</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by J.

This minimally invasive procedure could be useful when designing animal models for testing new contact lenses and has potential to apply to other biomaterial research on the ocular surface.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194795</canonicalUrl><updated>1522184400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f0c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-f?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>Mao, S.</name></author><engagement>1</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-f?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-f?rss=1</link><published>1522950073000</published><title>Live imaging of DNA loop extrusion</title><fingerprint>38d83cc5</fingerprint><keywords><item>Biochemistry</item></keywords><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a52984a:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/44.6.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1341?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>Hayden, A.</name></author><engagement>8</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1341?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1341?rss=1</link><published>1521740378000</published><title>Knowledge, wisdom, and the brain</title><fingerprint>fd4d890b</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1341.full</canonicalUrl><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:4150408:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3332.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Dal-Hoe Koo, William T.

Aims &lt;p&gt;Jumonji Domain-Containing 1A (JMJD1A) protein promotes demethylation of histones, especially at lysin-9 of di-methylated histone H3 (H3K9me2) or mono-methylated (H3K9me1). Increased levels of H3 histone methylation at lysin-9 (H3K9) is related to tumor suppressor gene silencing. &lt;i&gt;JMJD1A&lt;/i&gt; gene target Adrenomeduline (ADM) has shown to promote cell growth and tumorigenesis. JMJD1A and ADM expression, as well as H3K9 methylation level have been related with development risk and prognosis of several tumor types.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We aimed to evaluate JMJD1A, ADM, H3K9me1 and H3K9me2expression in paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays from 84 oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma samples through immunohistochemistry analysis.

H3K9me1 cytoplasmic expression was associated with reduced disease-specific death risk. Furthermore, high H3K9me2 nuclear expression was associated with worse specific-disease and disease-free survival. Finally, high ADM cytoplasmic expression was an independent marker of lymph node metastasis risk.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;JMJD1A, H3K9me1/2 and ADM expression may be predictor markers of progression and prognosis in oral and oropharynx cancer patients, as well as putative therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194884</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194884</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>JMJD1A, H3K9me1, H3K9me2 and ADM expression as prognostic markers in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma</title><fingerprint>4fef2778</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lucas de Lima Maia, Gabriela Tonini Peterle, Marcelo dos Santos, Leonardo Oliveira Trivilin, Suzanny Oliveira Mendes, Mayara Mota de Oliveira, Joaquim Gasparini dos Santos, Elaine Stur, Lidiane Pignaton Agostini, Cinthia Vidal Monteiro da Silva Couto, Juliana Dalbó, Aricia Leone Evangelista Monteiro de Assis, Anderson Barros Archanjo, Ana Maria Da Cunha Mercante, Rossana Veronica Mendoza Lopez, Fábio Daumas Nunes, Marcos Brasilino de Carvalho, Eloiza Helena Tajara, Iúri Drumond Louro, Adriana Madeira Álvares-da-Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity after acute coronary syndrome compared to patients without prior multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multicenter prospective cohort study in Switzerland included 5,635 patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome between 2009 and 2014, with a one-year follow-up period. We defined cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity as having at least two prior comorbidities before the index hospitalization. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional models were built to assess the one-year risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, defined as cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke. The final model was adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, tobacco consumption, education, and family history of cardiovascular disease, prescription of high-dose statinsat discharge and use of cardiac rehabilitation after discharge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 3,664 patients (65%) had no multimorbidity, 1,839 (33%) had cardiovascular multimorbidity, 62 (1%) had non-cardiovascular multimorbidity, and 70 (1%) had both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity. The multivariate risk of recurrent cardiovascular events was increased among patients with cardiovascular multimorbidity (hazard ratio (HR) 2.05, 95% CI: 1.54–2.73, p&amp;lt;0.001) and patients with non-cardiovascular multimorbidity (HR 2.57, 95% CI: 1.04–6.35, p = 0.04) compared to patients without multimorbidity.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity after acute coronary syndrome compared to patients without prior multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multicenter prospective cohort study in Switzerland included 5,635 patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome between 2009 and 2014, with a one-year follow-up period. We defined cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity as having at least two prior comorbidities before the index hospitalization. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional models were built to assess the one-year risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, defined as cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke. The final model was adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, tobacco consumption, education, and family history of cardiovascular disease, prescription of high-dose statinsat discharge and use of cardiac rehabilitation after discharge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 3,664 patients (65%) had no multimorbidity, 1,839 (33%) had cardiovascular multimorbidity, 62 (1%) had non-cardiovascular multimorbidity, and 70 (1%) had both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity. The multivariate risk of recurrent cardiovascular events was increased among patients with cardiovascular multimorbidity (hazard ratio (HR) 2.05, 95% CI: 1.54–2.73, p&amp;lt;0.001) and patients with non-cardiovascular multimorbidity (HR 2.57, 95% CI: 1.04–6.35, p = 0.04) compared to patients without multimorbidity. Patients with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity had the highest risk of recurrence with a HR of 5.19, 95% CI: 2.79–9.64, p&amp;lt;0.001, compared to patients without multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Multimorbidity increased by two-fold the risk of cardiovascular events over the year after an acute coronary syndrome. The magnitude of this increased risk was similar for patients with cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195174</canonicalUrl><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc713d:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4101</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Biotechnology</title></origin><author><name>Carlos Guijas</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metabolomics activity screening for identifying metabolites that modulate phenotype&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolomics activity screening for identifying metabolites that modulate phenotype, Published online: 05 April 2018;

Background &lt;p&gt;Sleep disordered breathing is a common but often undiagnosed comorbidity in heart failure patients. Cardiac implantable electronic devices used for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may detect sleep apnea by use of a transthoracic impedance sensor. Validation of the AP scan® algorithm (Boston Scientific®) was performed by using the diagnostic gold standard polysomnography (PSG).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-one patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction, frequent right ventricular pacing due to atrioventricular block and heart failure symptoms despite optimal medical therapy underwent upgrading to biventricular pacing. Within one month after left ventricular lead implantation, sleep apnea was assessed by single-night PSG and AP scan® measurements.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;AP scan® measurements were valid in only 21 of 41 (51.2%) patients in the index night of the PSG. The PSG determined apnea-hypopnea index did not correlate statistically significant with the AP scan® measurements (r = 0.41, 95% confidence interval -0.05–0.72, p = 0.07). The degree of overestimation is displayed by using the Bland-Altman method: mean difference -12.4, standard deviation ± 15.8, 95% confidence interval -43.3–18.6.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In heart failure patients receiving CRT upgrading, the AP scan® algorithm may need further improvement before it can be recommended for sleep apnea detection.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195573</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195573</link><published>1523048400000</published><title>Sleep apnea detection by a cardiac resynchronization device integrated thoracic impedance sensor: A validation study against the gold standard polysomnography</title><fingerprint>5406c201</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fabian Barbieri, Wolfgang Dichtl, Anna Heidbreder, Elisabeth Brandauer, Ambra Stefani, Agne Adukauskaite, Thomas Senoner, Wilfried Schgör, Florian Hintringer, Birgit Högl&lt;/p&gt;

The tumor suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in human breast cancer and is a marker for poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Transplantation of p53 null mouse mammary epithelium into syngeneic wild-type mice leads to normal mammary gland development followed by spontaneous mammary tumors that recapitulate many of the phenotypic, molecular and genetic features of human breast cancer. Transient exposure of p53 null mice to the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen leads to sustained and robust protection against tumor development. However the mechanism underlying this anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that transient exposure to tamoxifen leads to a reduction in mammary ductal side-branching and epithelial cell proliferation after tamoxifen withdrawal. Global gene expression analysis showed that transient tamoxifen exposure leads to persistent changes in the expression of a subset of estrogen regulated gene signatures in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Among these was the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 5 (&lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt;). We show that &lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt; is a novel tamoxifen regulated target gene which is upregulated in MECs after transient tamoxifen exposure and displays tumor suppressor activity in human breast cancer cells. Further, PTPN5 expression is strongly associated with good clinical outcome in tamoxifen treated human breast cancer patients suggesting that PTPN5 may represent a novel biomarker of tamoxifen response in human breast cancer.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194913</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194913</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Reprogramming of the estrogen responsive transcriptome contributes to tamoxifen-dependent protection against tumorigenesis in the p53 null mammary epithelial cells</title><fingerprint>33265d5b</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Murugesan Palaniappan, David Edwards, Chad J.

However the mechanism underlying this anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that transient exposure to tamoxifen leads to a reduction in mammary ductal side-branching and epithelial cell proliferation after tamoxifen withdrawal. Global gene expression analysis showed that transient tamoxifen exposure leads to persistent changes in the expression of a subset of estrogen regulated gene signatures in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Among these was the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 5 (&lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt;). We show that &lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt; is a novel tamoxifen regulated target gene which is upregulated in MECs after transient tamoxifen exposure and displays tumor suppressor activity in human breast cancer cells. Further, PTPN5 expression is strongly associated with good clinical outcome in tamoxifen treated human breast cancer patients suggesting that PTPN5 may represent a novel biomarker of tamoxifen response in human breast cancer.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194913</canonicalUrl><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2850.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Jiyao Song, Nikolaus Pfanner, Thomas Becker</name></author><description>Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell.

We applied an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; selection approach using two different plant lectins that bind to α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialic acids to determine which genetic changes of the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus alter hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding toward α2,3- or α2,6-linked glycans. Consecutive passages of the A/California/04/09 virus with or without lectins in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells led to development of three HA1 amino acid substitutions, N129D, G155E, and S183P, and one mutation in the neuraminidase (NA), G201E. The S183P mutation significantly increased binding to several α2,6 SA-linked glycans, including YDS, 6′SL(N), and 6-Su-6′SLN, compared to the wild-type virus (↑3.6-fold, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Two other HA1 mutations, N129D and G155E, were sufficient to significantly increase binding to α2,6-linked glycans, 6′SLN and 6-Su-6′SLN, compared to S183P (↑4.1-fold, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). These HA1 mutations also increased binding affinity for 3′SLN glycan compared to the wild-type virus as measured by Biacore surface plasmon resonance method. In addition, the HA1 N129D and HA1 G155E substitutions were identified as antigenic mutations. Furthermore, the G201E mutation in NA reduced the NA enzyme activity (↓2.3-fold). These findings demonstrate that the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus can acquire enhanced receptor affinity for both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic receptors under lectin-induced selective pressure. Such changes in binding affinity are conferred by selection of beneficial HA1 mutations that affect receptor specificity, antigenicity, and/or functional compatibility with the NA protein.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195525</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195525</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>The use of plant lectins to regulate H1N1 influenza A virus receptor binding activity</title><fingerprint>4588b250</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicolette Lee, Alexey M.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Influenza vaccination can prevent influenza and potentially serious influenza-related complications. Although the single best way to prevent influenza is annual vaccination, everyday preventive actions, including good hygiene, health, dietary, and social habits, might help, too. Several preventive measures are recommended, including: avoiding close contact with people who are sick; staying home when sick; covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing; washing your hands often; avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; and practicing other good health habits like cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, getting plenty of sleep, and drinking plenty of fluids. Understanding public acceptance and current usage of these preventive behaviors can be useful for planning both seasonal and pandemic influenza prevention campaigns. This study estimated the percentage of adults in the United States who reported practicing preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza, and explored associations of reported behaviors with sociodemographic factors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from 2015 National Internet Flu Survey, a nationally representative probability-based Internet panel survey of the non-institutionalized U.S. population ≥18 years. The self-reported behaviors used to avoid catching or spreading influenza were grouped into four and three non-mutually exclusive subgroups, respectively. Weighted proportions were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted prevalence differences and to determine independent associations between sociodemographic characteristics and preventive behavior subgroups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Common preventive behaviors reported were: 83.2% wash hands often, 80.0% cover coughs and sneezes, 78.2% stay home if sick with a respiratory illness, 64.4% avoid people sick with a respiratory illness, 51.7% use hand sanitizers, 50.2% get treatment as soon as possible, and 49.8% report getting the influenza vaccination. Race/ethnicity, gender, age, education, income, region, receipt of influenza vaccination, and household size were associated with use of preventive behaviors after controlling for other factors.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Many adults in the United States reported using preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza. Though vaccination is the most important tool available to prevent influenza, the addition of preventive behaviors might play an effective role in reducing or slowing transmission of influenza and complement prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195085</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195085</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>Preventive behaviors adults report using to avoid catching or spreading influenza, United States, 2015-16 influenza season</title><fingerprint>c50f433e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anup Srivastav, Tammy A.

Although tau pathology, behavioral deficits, and neuronal loss are observed in patients with tauopathies, the relationship between these endpoints has not been clearly established. Here we found that rTg4510 mice, which overexpress human mutant tau in the forebrain, develop progressive age-dependent increases in locomotor activity (LMA), which correlates with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, hyperphosphorylated tau levels, and brain atrophy. To further clarify the relationship between these endpoints, we treated the rTg4510 mice with either doxycycline to reduce mutant tau expression or an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor Thiamet G, which has been shown to ameliorate tau pathology in animal models. We found that both doxycycline and Thiamet G treatments starting at 2 months of age prevented the progression of hyperactivity, slowed brain atrophy, and reduced brain hyperphosphorylated tau. In contrast, initiating doxycycline treatment at 4 months reduced neither brain hyperphosphorylated tau nor hyperactivity, further confirming the relationship between these measures. Collectively, our results demonstrate a unique behavioral phenotype in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy that strongly correlates with disease progression, and that early interventions which reduce tau pathology ameliorate the progression of the locomotor dysfunction. These findings suggest that better understanding the relationship between locomotor deficits and tau pathology in the rTg4510 model may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying behavioral disturbances in patients with tauopathies.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195486</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195486</link><published>1523048400000</published><title>Early intervention of tau pathology prevents behavioral changes in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy</title><fingerprint>b761e70b</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaohai Wang, Karen Smith, Michelle Pearson, Anna Hughes, Mali L.

These findings suggest that better understanding the relationship between locomotor deficits and tau pathology in the rTg4510 model may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying behavioral disturbances in patients with tauopathies.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195486</canonicalUrl><updated>1523048400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd07f:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Miruna Silvia Stan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23621-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/OKpeOlc517M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>21</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/OKpeOlc517M/s41598-018-23621-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x</link><published>1522134000000</published><title>Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO2 quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces</title><fingerprint>bb9e7635</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23621-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/OKpeOlc517M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16266d0d910:5f99c86:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23621-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23621_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width><height>232</height></visual><crawled>1522143385872</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288225v1?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Dai, R.</name></author><description>In original Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), the signed network considers the sign of correlation and only positive correlations make sense in the network.

Background &lt;p&gt;Polypharmacy is common among older adults. However, little is known about the composition of polypharmacy: which are the most frequently used drugs, and how much do these drugs contribute to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 822,619 Swedes aged ≥75 years was identified from the Total Population Register. Through record-linkage with the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and the Social Services Register we could analyze concurrent drug use in the entire population (both individuals living in the community and institution) on the 31 December 2013.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of polypharmacy (≥5 drugs) was 45%. The most frequently used drugs were cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, and psychotropics. By excluding the ten most frequently used drug classes or compounds, the prevalence of polypharmacy was reduced by 69% and 51% respectively. The majority of the users of either one of the 10 most frequently used drugs concurrently used at least 4 other drug classes (66%-85%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Almost half of the individuals aged ≥75 years are exposed to polypharmacy in Sweden. A handful of drugs make a large contribution to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy and the majority of drugs prescribed to persons aged ≥75 years are used in combination with other drugs.

The burden of depression and anxiety disorders is greater in women, and female sex hormones have been shown to affect mood. Psychological side effects of hormonal contraception (HC) are also a common complaint in the clinic, but few previous studies have investigated this subject. We therefore wanted to investigate whether use of HC was associated with adverse psychological health outcomes, and whether this association was modified by age. All women aged 12–30 years on 31 December 2010, residing in Sweden for at least four years and with no previous psychiatric morbidity (n = 815 662), were included. We followed the women from their first HC use (or 31 December 2010, if they were non-users) at baseline, until a prescription fill of psychotropic drugs or the end of the one-year follow-up. We performed age-stratified logistic regression models and estimated odds ratios (OR) to measure the association between different HC methods and psychotropic drug use, as well as the area under the receiver operating curve to estimate discriminatory accuracy of HC in relation to psychotropic drugs. Overall, we found an association between HC and psychotropic drugs (adjusted OR 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–1.37). In the age-stratified analysis, the strongest association was found in adolescent girls (adjusted OR 3.46, 95% CI 3.04–4.94 for age 12 to 14 years), while it was non-existent for adult women. We conclude that hormonal contraception is associated with psychotropic drug use among adolescent girls, suggesting an adverse effect of HC on psychological health in this population.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194773</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194773</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Hormonal contraception increases the risk of psychotropic drug use in adolescent girls but not in adults: A pharmacoepidemiological study on 800 000 Swedish women</title><fingerprint>6b2f05c2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Zettermark, Raquel Perez Vicente, Juan Merlo&lt;/p&gt;

Genetic deletion of various types of nAChRs, located on specific interneurons, impacts the properties of ultra-slow transitions between high and low activity states (H-states and L-states, respectively), recorded in mice during quiet wakefulness. In addition, recent data indicate that a genetic mutation of the 5 nAChR subunit located on vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) inhibitory neurons, the rs16969968 single nucleotide polymorphism (5 SNP), appears to be responsible for &amp;quot;hypofrontality&amp;quot; observed in schizophrenia. Chronic nicotine application to 5 SNP mice restores neural activity to control levels. Using firing rate models of hierarchically organized neural populations, we showed that the change of activity patterns recorded in the genetically modified mice can be explained by a change of activity state stability, differentially modulated by cholinergic inputs to parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM) or VIP inhibitory populations. A change in amplitude, but not duration of H-states fully account for the lowered pyramidal (PYR) firing rates recorded in 5 SNP mice. We demonstrate that desensitization and upregulation of {beta}2 nAChRs located on SOM interneurons, but not activation of 5 nAChRs located on VIP interneurons, by chronic nicotine application could account for activity normalization recorded in 5 SNP mice. The model implies that subsequent nicotine withdrawal should lead to PYR activity depression more severe than the original hypofrontality caused by SNP mutation.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301051v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301051v1?rss=1</link><published>1523602800000</published><title>Nicotinic modulation of hierarchal inhibitory control over prefrontal cortex resting state dynamics: modeling of genetic modification and schizophrenia-related pathology [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>e7f514a5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) strongly modulate the cholinergic drive to a hierarchy of inhibitory neurons in the superficial layers of the PFC, critical to cognitive processes.

The centrosome is a non–membrane-bound cellular compartment consisting of 2 centrioles surrounded by a protein coat termed the pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrioles generally remain physically associated together (a phenomenon called centrosome cohesion), yet how this occurs in the absence of a bounding lipid membrane is unclear. One model posits that pericentriolar fibres formed from rootletin protein directly link centrioles, yet little is known about the structure, biophysical properties, or assembly kinetics of such fibres. Here, I combine live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged rootletin with cell fusion and find previously unrecognised plasticity in centrosome cohesion. Rootletin forms large, diffusionally stable bifurcating fibres, which amass slowly on mature centrioles over many hours from anaphase. Nascent centrioles (procentrioles), in contrast, do not form roots and must be licensed to do so through polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) activity. Transient separation of roots accompanies centriolar repositioning during the interphase, suggesting that centrioles organize as independent units, each containing discrete roots. Indeed, forced induction of duplicate centriole pairs allows independent reshuffling of individual centrioles between the pairs. Therefore collectively, these findings suggest that progressively nucleated polymers mediate the dynamic association of centrioles as either 1 or 2 interphase centrosomes, with implications for the understanding of how non–membrane-bound organelles self-organise.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/44jiWSXqczI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162bafef6cd:c0b2af:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Mahen&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of the present study is to differentiate subtypes of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) using ex vivo ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Included were 14 surgically resected hippocampi of patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The resected hippocampi were histologically categorized into subtypes of hippocampal sclerosis (HS type 1 (n = 10), HS type 2 (n = 2) and no-HS (n = 2)) and subsequently scanned on a preclinical 7T MRI acquiring T2-weighted morphology, relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging. On the morphological images, the pyramidal cell layer (PCL) of the hippocampus was segmented and the following parameters were derived: T2 signal intensity, T1-, T2- and T2*-relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Furthermore, the area of the PCL was determined, as well as the parameter product which refers to the widths of the PCL parallel and perpendicular to the stratum moleculare. Spearman correlation coefficient was used to demonstrate relationships between MR-parameters and type of sclerosis. In comparison to no-HS specimens, the PCL was significantly narrower in HS type 1 and HS type 2 hippocampi. This narrowing affected the entire cornu ammonis sector (CA) 1 in HS type 1, while it was limited to the upper half of CA1 in direction to CA2 in HS type 2. The parameter product median increased from 0.43 to 1.67 and 2.91 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for HS type 1, HS type 2 and no-HS, respectively. Correlation coefficients were significant for the PCL parameters product (0.73), area (0.71), T2*-time (-0.67), FA (0.65) and ADC (0.55). Our initial results suggest that HS type 1, HS type 2 and no-HS subtypes can be distinguished from each other using ex vivo UHF MRI based on T2-weighted morphologic images and the assessment of the parameter product. Upon clinical translation, UHF-MRI may provide a promising technique for the preoperative differentiation of HS subtypes in patients.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196008</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196008</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>Ultra-high field MRI of human hippocampi: Morphological and multiparametric differentiation of hippocampal sclerosis subtypes</title><fingerprint>14c9f5b3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Clarissa Gillmann, Roland Coras, Karl Rössler, Arnd Doerfler, Michael Uder, Ingmar Blümcke, Tobias Bäuerle&lt;/p&gt;

Anemia commonly occurs in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The management of patients with anemia in CKD is challenging, due to its severity, frequent hypo-responsiveness to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) and common hemoglobin cycling. Nonlinear dose-response curves and long delays in the effect of treatment on red blood cell population size complicate predictions of hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in individual patients. A comprehensive physiology based mathematical model for erythropoiesis was adapted individually to 60 hemodialysis patients treated with ESAs by identifying physiologically meaningful key model parameters from temporal Hgb data. Crit-Line&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; III monitors provided non-invasive Hgb measurements for every hemodialysis treatment. We used Hgb data during a 150-day baseline period together to estimate a patient’s individual red blood cell lifespan, effects of the ESA on proliferation of red cell progenitor cells, endogenous erythropoietin production and ESA half-life. Estimated patient specific parameters showed excellent alignment with previously conducted clinical studies in hemodialysis patients. Further, the model qualitatively and quantitatively reflected empirical hemoglobin dynamics in demographically, anthropometrically and clinically diverse patients and accurately predicted the Hgb response to ESA therapy in individual patients for up to 21 weeks. The findings suggest that estimated model parameters can be used as a proxy for parameters that are clinically very difficult to quantify. The presented method has the potential to provide new insights into the individual pathophysiology of renal anemia and its association with clinical outcomes and can potentially be used to guide personalized anemia treatment.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195918</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195918</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>Prediction of hemoglobin levels in individual hemodialysis patients by means of a mathematical model of erythropoiesis</title><fingerprint>43effe27</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Doris H.

The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFα therapy (p = 0.031).

It is an absolute requirement that every time you write about graphene that you mention that the breakthrough in its isolation came from the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0218/230218-graphene-sticky-tape&quot;&gt;adhesive tape&lt;/a&gt;, a low-tech insight at Manchester that led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/&quot;&gt;Nobel&lt;/a&gt; and kicked off a massive field of research. The latest is that earlier this month, a group at MIT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02773-w&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that if you bring two graphene sheets together, parallel but at a slightly different rotational angle (about 1.1 degrees), that the system becomes a superconductor at low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was already unexpected, but the behavior of the material (electron density versus temperature) suggests some real similarities to the copper-oxide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity&quot;&gt;high-temperature superconductors&lt;/a&gt;, and no one saw that coming, either. (Note that “high temperature”, in this field, still means “can be reached in liquid nitrogen as opposed to liquid helium”). Despite a really impressive amount of theoretical and experimental work on the cuprate materials, the full details of their superconductivity are still a matter of debate. It seems to come down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair&quot;&gt;Cooper pairs&lt;/a&gt; (as with the classic low-temperature superconductors, but the mechanism of the electron pairing is different and in ways that still start arguments. This new graphene systems might be able to shed some light on the various proposals, and you can be certain that a great deal of late-night coffee has been consumed in recent weeks to come up with appropriate experiments along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical value of such an understanding could well be huge (and there is, of course, another near-certain Nobel in physics waiting for whoever puts the field on a firmer basis). To give another recent MIT-related example, new superconductor engineering is at the heart of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-newly-formed-company-launch-novel-approach-fusion-power-0309&quot;&gt;recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; the university made about fusion power. The belief is that large-bore magnets of such materials, which now appear feasible, could allow a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak&quot;&gt;tokamak&lt;/a&gt;-design fusion reactor that is far more compact than any previous attempts. Wrestling with the magnets is one of the biggest problems in designing such machines, because you need extremely strong, extremely homogeneous fields. The high-temperature superconductors were recognized early on as having great possibilities in this area, but the first fusion reactor that used only these materials only became operational in 2014 (a spherical tokamak design at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Tokamak Energy&lt;/a&gt; in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphene-layer materials are still operating at very low temperatures – but considering their electron density, it’s actually a lot higher than it should be. No one is going to be make fusion reactors with twisted-graphite magnets any time soon, but twisted graphite might possibly be the platform that leads us to the magnets that fusion reactors will use.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Chemical News</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_1623e80cd73:266183f:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521467051379</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/19/graphene-continues-to-surprise</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25183?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25183?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25183?af=R</link><published>1522115890699</published><unread>False</unread><fingerprint>a9254cad</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162652d4e0b:6cdef:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522115890699</crawled></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231415v2?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><author><name>Weber, L.</name></author><description>In quantitative analyses of biological processes, one may use many different scales of models (e.g., spatial or non-spatial, deterministic or stochastic, time-varying or at steady-state) or many different approaches to match models to experimental data (e.g., model fitting or parameter uncertainty/sloppiness quantification with different experiment designs).

Background &lt;p&gt;Aluminum phosphide (AlP) is used as pesticide in some countries for protection of stored grains. Human poisoning with AlP due to suicide attempt or accidental environmental exposure is associated with very high mortality partially due to development of severe metabolic acidosis. Previous studies have shown that hemoglobin has high buffering capacity and erythrocytes can potentially be used for management of metabolic acidosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fresh packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion on survival and cardiovascular function in AlP-poisoned rats.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Rats were poisoned with AlP by gavage. Fresh packed RBC was transfused via tail vein after AlP administration. Acid-base balance, vital signs and mortality was assessed and compared in experimental groups. Infusion of fresh packed RBC (1.5 ml) one hour after AlP (4–15 mg/kg) intoxication was associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate. Packed RBC infusion improved blood pH, HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. Plasma troponin level was also reduced and ECG changes were reversed following packed RBC infusion in AlP intoxicated rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our results showed that fresh RBC transfusion could ameliorate metabolic acidosis and enhance survival in AlP-poisoned rat. We assume that an increase in pool of RBCs may modulate acid-base balance or potentially chelate AlP-related toxic intermediates via phosphine-hemoglobin interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193991</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193991</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Fresh red blood cells transfusion protects against aluminum phosphide-induced metabolic acidosis and mortality in rats</title><fingerprint>1c28be8d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nastaran Rahimi, Amir Hossein Abdolghaffari, Alireza Partoazar, Nina Javadian, Tara Dehpour, Ali R.

Viruses and bacteria are critical components of the human microbiome and play important roles in health and disease. Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and viruses independently, thereby reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that maintain community robustness or allow phage-host populations to co-evolve. We implemented a network-based analytical approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We built these community networks using a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given microbiome. Our algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We observed evidence that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets appeared to be associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and likely more susceptible to network degradation by microbial extinction events. This study quantified and contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as disease states, through ecological networks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_YNV8fo1dhc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162d9eb5eb9:b6eef:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Geoffrey D.

Detailed knowledge of how a rider’s seating style and riding on a circle influences the movement symmetry of the horse’s head and pelvis may aid rider and trainer in an early recognition of low grade lameness. Such knowledge is also important during both subjective and objective lameness evaluations in the ridden horse in a clinical setting. In this study, inertial sensors were used to assess how different rider seating styles may influence head and pelvic movement symmetry in horses trotting in a straight line and on the circle in both directions. A total of 26 horses were subjected to 15 different conditions at trot: three unridden conditions and 12 ridden conditions where the rider performed three different seating styles (rising trot, sitting trot and two point seat). Rising trot induced systematic changes in movement symmetry of the horses. The most prominent effect was decreased pelvic rise that occurred as the rider was actively rising up in the stirrups, thus creating a downward momentum counteracting the horses push off. This mimics a push off lameness in the hindlimb that is in stance when the rider sits down in the saddle during the rising trot. On the circle, the asymmetries induced by rising trot on the correct diagonal counteracted the circle induced asymmetries, rendering the horse more symmetrical. This finding offers an explanation to the equestrian tradition of rising on the ‘correct diagonal.’ In horses with small pre-existing movement asymmetries, the asymmetry induced by rising trot, as well as the circular track, attenuated or reduced the horse’s baseline asymmetry, depending on the sitting diagonal and direction on the circle. A push off hindlimb lameness would be expected to increase when the rider sits during the lame hindlimb stance whereas an impact hindlimb lameness would be expected to decrease. These findings suggest that the rising trot may be useful for identifying the type of lameness during subjective lameness assessment of hindlimb lameness. This theory needs to be studied further in clinically lame horses.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Influence of seating styles on head and pelvic vertical movement symmetry in horses ridden at trot</title><fingerprint>b3a0b371</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Persson-Sjodin, Elin Hernlund, Thilo Pfau, Pia Haubro Andersen, Marie Rhodin&lt;/p&gt;

The environmental fates of pharmaceuticals and the effects of crop protection products on non-target species are subjects that are undergoing intense review. Since measuring the concentrations and effects of xenobiotics on all affected species under all conceivable scenarios is not feasible, standard laboratory animals such as rabbits are tested, and the observed adverse effects are translated to focal species for environmental risk assessments. In that respect, mathematical modelling is becoming increasingly important for evaluating the consequences of pesticides in untested scenarios. In particular, physiologically based pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic (PBPK/TK) modelling is a well-established methodology used to predict tissue concentrations based on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs and toxicants. In the present work, a rabbit PBPK/TK model is developed and evaluated with data available from the literature. The model predictions include scenarios of both intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) administration of small and large compounds. The presented rabbit PBPK/TK model predicts the pharmacokinetics (Cmax, AUC) of the tested compounds with an average 1.7-fold error. This result indicates a good predictive capacity of the model, which enables its use for risk assessment modelling and simulations.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194294</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194294</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>Development and validation of a physiology-based model for the prediction of pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics in rabbits</title><fingerprint>b4ac6c98</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Panteleimon D.

Despite increasing ability to store and analyze large amounts of data for organismal and ecological studies, the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images has largely remained time consuming and error-prone, particularly for tasks for which automation is difficult or impossible. Improving the efficiency of these tasks, which allows for more high quality data to be collected in a shorter amount of time, is therefore a high priority. The open-source web application, webpic, implements common web languages and widely available libraries and productivity apps to streamline the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images. In this paper, I introduce the framework of webpic and demonstrate one readily available feature of this application, linear measurements, using fossil leaf specimens. This application fills the gap between workflows accomplishable by individuals through existing software and those accomplishable by large, unmoderated crowds. It demonstrates that flexible web languages can be used to streamline time-intensive research tasks without the use of specialized equipment or proprietary software and highlights the potential for web resources to facilitate data collection in research tasks and outreach activities with improved efficiency.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195184</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195184</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>webpic: A flexible web application for collecting distance and count measurements from images</title><fingerprint>4d326f63</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lucy M.

The &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; cell lineage is nearly invariant. Whether this stereotyped cell-division pattern promotes reproducibility in cell shapes/positions is not generally known, as manual spatiotemporal cell-shape/position alignments are labor-intensive, and fully-automated methods are not described. Here, we report automated algorithms for spatiotemporal alignments of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryos from pre-morphogenesis to motor-activity initiation. We use sparsely-labeled green-fluorescent nuclei and a pan-nuclear red-fluorescent reporter to register consecutive imaging time points and compare embryos. Using our method, we monitor early assembly of the nerve-ring (NR) brain neuropil. While NR pioneer neurons exhibit reproducible growth kinetics and axon positions, cell-body placements are variable. Thus, pioneer-neuron axon locations, but not cell-body positions, are under selection. We also show that anterior NR displacement in &lt;i&gt;cam-1&lt;/i&gt;/ROR Wnt-receptor mutants is not an early NR assembly defect. Our results demonstrate the utility of automated spatiotemporal alignments of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryos, and uncover key principles guiding nervous-system development in this animal.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194861</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194861</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Automated &amp;lt;i&gt;C&amp;lt;/i&gt;. &amp;lt;i&gt;elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; embryo alignments reveal brain neuropil position invariance despite lax cell body placement</title><fingerprint>30642d54</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Insley, Shai Shaham&lt;/p&gt;

Our results demonstrate the utility of automated spatiotemporal alignments of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryos, and uncover key principles guiding nervous-system development in this animal.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194861</canonicalUrl><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4244:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194552</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Jung-Ah Lim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jung-Ah Lim, Jangsup Moon, Tae-Joon Kim, Jin-Sun Jun, Byeongsu Park, Jung-Ick Byun, Jun-Sang Sunwoo, Kyung-Il Park, Soon-Tae Lee, Keun-Hwa Jung, Ki-Young Jung, Manho Kim, Daejong Jeon, Kon Chu, Sang Kun Lee&lt;/p&gt;
Seizure clustering is a common and significant phenomenon in patients with epilepsy. The clustering of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) in animal models of epilepsy, including mouse pilocarpine models, has been reported. However, most studies have analyzed seizures for a short duration after the induction of status epilepticus (SE). In this study, we investigated the detailed characteristics of seizure clustering in the chronic stage of a mouse pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model for an extended duration by continuous 24/7 video-EEG monitoring. A seizure cluster was defined as the occurrence of one or more seizures per day for at least three consecutive days and at least five seizures during the cluster period. We analyzed the cluster duration, seizure-free period, cluster interval, and numbers of seizures within and outside the seizure clusters. The video-EEG monitoring began 84.5±33.7 days after the induction of SE and continued for 53.7±20.4 days. Every mouse displayed seizure clusters, and 97.0% of the seizures occurred within a cluster period. The seizure clusters were followed by long seizure-free periods of 16.3±6.8 days, showing a cyclic pattern. The SRSs also occurred in a grouped pattern within a day. We demonstrate that almost all seizures occur in clusters with a cyclic pattern in the chronic stage of a mouse pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model. The seizure-free periods between clusters were long. These findings should be considered when performing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies using this animal model. Furthermore, this model might be appropriate for studying the unrevealed mechanism of ictogenesis.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194552</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194552</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>Clustering of spontaneous recurrent seizures separated by long seizure-free periods: An extended video-EEG monitoring study of a pilocarpine mouse model</title><fingerprint>562867d1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jung-Ah Lim, Jangsup Moon, Tae-Joon Kim, Jin-Sun Jun, Byeongsu Park, Jung-Ick Byun, Jun-Sang Sunwoo, Kyung-Il Park, Soon-Tae Lee, Keun-Hwa Jung, Ki-Young Jung, Manho Kim, Daejong Jeon, Kon Chu, Sang Kun Lee&lt;/p&gt;
