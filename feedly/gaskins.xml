New biotic stresses have emerged around the globe over the last decades threatening food safety and security. In 2016, scientists confirmed the presence of the devastating wheat-blast disease in Bangladesh, South Asia–its first occurrence outside South America. Severely blast-affected wheat fields had their grain yield wiped out. This poses a severe threat to food security in a densely-populated region with millions of poor inhabitants where wheat is a major staple crop and per capita wheat consumption has been increasing. As an &lt;i&gt;ex ante&lt;/i&gt; impact assessment, this study examined potential wheat-blast scenarios in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Based on the agro-climatic conditions in the epicenter, where the disease was first identified in Bangladesh in 2016, this study identified the correspondingly vulnerable areas in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh amounting to 7 million ha. Assuming a conservative scenario of 5–10% for blast-induced wheat production loss, this study estimated the annual potential wheat loss across the sampled countries to be 0.89–1.77 million tons, equivalent to USD 132–264 million. Such losses further threaten an already-precarious national food security, putting pressure on wheat imports and wheat prices. The study is a call for action to tackle the real wheat-blast threat in South Asia.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197555</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Threat of wheat blast to South Asia’s food security: An &amp;lt;i&gt;ex-ante&amp;lt;/i&gt; analysis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Khondoker Abdul Mottaleb, Pawan Kumar Singh, Kai Sonder, Gideon Kruseman, Thakur Prasad Tiwari, Naresh C.

The widespread use of social media has created a valuable but underused source of data for the environmental sciences. We demonstrate the potential for images posted to the website Twitter to capture variability in vegetation phenology across United States National Parks. We process a subset of images posted to Twitter within eight U.S. National Parks, with the aim of understanding the amount of green vegetation in each image. Analysis of the relative greenness of the images show statistically significant seasonal cycles across most National Parks at the 95% confidence level, consistent with springtime green-up and fall senescence. Additionally, these social media-derived greenness indices correlate with monthly mean satellite NDVI (r = 0.62), reinforcing the potential value these data could provide in constraining models and observing regions with limited high quality scientific monitoring.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197325</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Observing vegetation phenology through social media</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sam J.

BATISCAF is freely available on GitHub: https://github.com/mandricigor/batiscaf.</content></content><title>Solving scaffolding problem with repeats [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Mandric, I.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/25/330472</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/330472v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>7</engagement><crawled>1525801790399</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16340dfabbf:493f39:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05125-w</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mutant mice hold back the years &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutant mice hold back the years , Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05125-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05125-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Animals age more slowly after reduction of a protein that affects metabolism.</description><published>1525762800000</published><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05125-w</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mutant mice hold back the years &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutant mice hold back the years , Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05125-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05125-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Animals age more slowly after reduction of a protein that affects metabolism.</content></content><title>Mutant mice hold back the years</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05125-w/d41586-018-05125-w_15736078.jpg</url><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><fingerprint>b493012d</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05125-w</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527620470952</crawled><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_163ad4688a8:21a1182:2835af05</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5251.short?rss=1</originId><description>GENETICS, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES Correction for “Worldwide distribution of the DCDC2 READ1 regulatory element and its relationship with phoneme variation across languages,” by Mellissa M.

In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples. Scaled quantile residual plots are also introduced as an effective diagnostic to visualize the quality of the estimated probability densities. Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>High throughput nonparametric probability density estimation</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jenny Farmer, Donald Jacobs&lt;/p&gt;

This iterative approach has a closed-form solution at convergence with desirable performance properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NE in denoising biological networks for several challenging yet important problems. Our experiments show that NE improves gene function prediction by denoising interaction networks from 22 human tissues. Further, we use NE to interpret noisy Hi-C contact maps from the human genome and demonstrate its utility across varying degrees of data quality. Finally, when applied to fine-grained species identification, NE outperforms alternative approaches by a significant margin. Taken together, our results indicate that NE is widely applicable for denoising weighted biological networks, especially when they contain high levels of noise.</description><published>1525849200000</published><fingerprint>66f86ccd</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/317941v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Networks are ubiquitous in biology where they encode connectivity patterns at all scales of organization, from molecular to the biome.

Although highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) remarkably increased life expectancy of HIV positive people, the rate of novel HIV-1 infections worldwide still represent a major concern. In this context, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) approaches such as vaginal microbicide gels topically releasing antiretroviral drugs, showed to have a striking impact in limiting HIV-1 spread. Nevertheless, the co-presence of other genital infections, particularly those due to HSV-1 or 2, constitute a serious drawback that strongly limits the efficacy of PrEP approaches. For this reason, combinations of different compounds with mixed antiviral and antiretroviral activity are thoroughly investigated Here we report the synthesis and the biological evaluation of a novel series of rhodanine derivatives, which showed to inhibit both HIV-1 and HSV-1/2 replication at nanomolar concentration, and were found to be active also on acyclovir resistant HSV-2 strains. The compounds showed a considerable reduction of activity in presence of serum due to a high binding to serum albumin, as determined through &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; ADME evaluations. However, the most promising compound of the series maintained a considerable activity in gel formulation, with an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; comparable to that obtained for the reference drug tenofovir. Moreover, the series of compounds showed pharmacokinetic properties suitable for topical formulation, thus suggesting that the novel rhodanine derivatives could represent effective agents to be used as dual anti HIV/HSV microbicides in PrEP approaches.</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Rhodanine derivatives as potent anti-HIV and anti-HSV microbicides</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cristina Tintori, Giulia Iovenitti, Elisa Rita Ceresola, Roberto Ferrarese, Claudio Zamperini, Annalaura Brai, Giulio Poli, Elena Dreassi, Valeria Cagno, David Lembo, Filippo Canducci, Maurizio Botta&lt;/p&gt;

Brain region-specific alterations in neuronal density and composition originate prenatally in trisomy 21 individuals, and are presumed to underlie the intellectual disability and early onset neurodegeneration that characterizes Down syndrome. However, the mechanisms by which chromosome 21 aneuploidy drives alterations in the central nervous system are not well understood, particularly in brain regions that are uniquely human and thus inaccessible to established animal models. Cerebral organoids are pluripotent stem cell derived models of prenatal brain development that have been used to deepen our understanding of the atypical processes associated with human neurobiological disorders, and thus provide a promising avenue to explore the molecular basis for neurodevelopmental alterations in trisomy 21. Here, we employ high-resolution label-free mass spectrometry to map proteomic changes over the course of trisomy 21 cerebral organoid development, and evaluate the proteomic alterations in response to treatment with harmine, a small molecule inhibitor of the chromosome 21 encoded protein kinase DYRK1A. Our results reveal trisomy 21 specific dysregulation of networks associated with neurogenesis, axon guidance and extracellular matrix remodeling. We find significant overlap of these networks with previously identified dysregulated gene expression modules identified in trisomy 21 fetal brain tissue.

The dentate gyrus is essential for remembering the fine details of experiences that comprise episodic memory. Dentate gyrus granule cells receive highly-processed sensory information and are hypothesized to perform a pattern separation function, whereby similar sensory inputs are transformed into orthogonal neural representations. Behaviorally, this is believed to enable distinct memory for highly interfering stimuli. Since the dentate gyrus is comprised of a large number of adult-born neurons, which have unique synaptic wiring and neurophysiological firing patterns, it has been proposed that neurogenesis may contribute to this process in unique ways. Some behavioral evidence exists to support this role, whereby neurogenesis-deficient rodents are impaired at discriminating the fine visuospatial details of experiences. However, the extent to which newborn neurons contribute to dentate gyrus-dependent learning tasks is unclear. Furthermore, since most studies of dentate gyrus function are conducted in male rats, little is known about how females perform in similar situations, and whether there might be sex differences in the function of adult neurogenesis. To address these issues, we examined spatial discrimination memory in transgenic male and female rats that lacked adult neurogenesis. The first task probed memory for the position of local objects in an open field, assessed by behavioral responses to novel object locations. The second task examined memory for distal environmental cues. All rats were able to successfully discriminate local and distal cue changes. Males and females also performed comparably, although females displayed higher levels of rearing and locomotion. Collectively, our results indicate that rats are capable of learning about local and distal cues in the absence of adult neurogenesis.</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197869</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Intact memory for local and distal cues in male and female rats that lack adult neurogenesis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Desiree R.

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1525986000000</published><fingerprint>34d1490d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006057</link><title>Nonlinear decoding of a complex movie from the mammalian retina</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vicente Botella-Soler, Stéphane Deny, Georg Martius, Olivier Marre, Gašper Tkačik&lt;/p&gt;

We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><author><name>Vicente Botella-Soler</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006057</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0tROk9h9FSA/article</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1525984928890</recrawled></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>8</engagement><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce961:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/855?rss=1</originId><published>1527183688000</published><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/855.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><title>Cold chemistry with two atoms</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Narevicius, E.</name></author><fingerprint>7a540074</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/855?rss=1</href></item></alternate><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/855?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ee:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197355</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byoungjae Kim, Hyun-Ji Lee, Nu-Ri Im, Doh Young Lee, Ha Kyun Kim, Cha Young Kang, Il-Ho Park, Seung Hoon Lee, Heung-Man Lee, Sang Hag Lee, Seung-Kuk Baek, Tae Hoon Kim&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;In airway epithelium, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22) are induced by defective epithelial barriers such as E-cadherin and attract the effector cells of Th2 immunity. However, the association between the epithelial barrier and CCL17 expression has not been studied in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). Thus, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CCL17 and its regulation by Th cytokines in nasal polyp (NP) epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The expression and distribution of CCL17, CCL22, E-cadherin and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were measured using real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry and compared between normal ethmoid sinus epithelium and NP epithelium. In addition, the expression level of CCL17 was determined in cultured epithelial cells treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The expression of CCL17 was decreased in the NP epithelium compared to the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus, whereas the expression of CCL22 was not decreased. E-cadherin was differentially distributed between the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus and NP epithelium. EGFR was also decreased in NPs. Interestingly, the stimulation of cultured epithelial cells with Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, resulted in an upregulation of CCL17 expression only in NP epithelial cells whereas the expression of CCL17 was increased in both normal epithelial cells and NP epithelial cells by Th1 cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decreased expression of CCL17 in defective NP epithelium may be closely connected to NP pathogenesis and can be differentially regulated by cytokines in the NP epithelium of patients with CRSwNP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197355</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Decreased expression of CCL17 in the disrupted nasal polyp epithelium and its regulation by IL-4 and IL-5</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Byoungjae Kim, Hyun-Ji Lee, Nu-Ri Im, Doh Young Lee, Ha Kyun Kim, Cha Young Kang, Il-Ho Park, Seung Hoon Lee, Heung-Man Lee, Sang Hag Lee, Seung-Kuk Baek, Tae Hoon Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Our objective is to offer a domain specific knowledge platform to solve complex biological and agronomical questions related to the implication of genes/proteins in, for instances, plant disease resistance or high yield traits.

Paddy rice fields are one of the most important sources of anthropogenic methane. Improving the accuracy in the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; budget is fundamental to identify strategies to mitigate climate change. Such improvement requires a mechanistic understanding of the complex interactions between environmental and agronomic factors determining CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, and also the characterization of the annual temporal CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions pattern in the whole crop cycle. Hence, both the growing and fallow seasons must be included. However, most of the previous research has been based on single-factor analyses that are focused on the growing season. In order to fill this gap, a study was conducted in a Mediterranean rice agrosystem (Ebre Delta, Catalonia) following a farm-to-farm approach with the purpose of 1) evaluating the cumulative and temporal pattern of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission, and 2) conducting a multi-variate analyses to assess the associative pattern, relative contribution and temporal variation of the main explanatory variables concerning the observed CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Measurements of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and agronomic and environmental parameters in 15 commercial rice fields were monitored monthly, during a whole crop field cycle. The temporal pattern of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission followed a bi-modal distribution peaking in August and October. The cumulative annual CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from rice fields amounted 314 kg CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, of which &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 70% were emitted during the fallow season. The main controlling factors of the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission rate in the growing season were positive related to water level and plant cover, while soil redox was negatively related. The main controlling factors in the fallow season were water level (negatively related, conversely to the growing season), as well as straw incorporation and soil temperature (positively related). The results of this study highlight the importance of the often neglected fallow season in the accurate estimation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and, thus, the necessity of measurement programs that cover the whole crop field cycle. This information is the first step for setting effective mitigation strategies based on straw and water management.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198081</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Neglecting the fallow season can significantly underestimate annual methane emissions in Mediterranean rice fields</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maite Martínez-Eixarch, Carles Alcaraz, Marc Viñas, Joan Noguerol, Xavier Aranda, Francesc Xavier Prenafeta-Boldú, Jesús Antonio Saldaña-De la Vega, Maria del Mar Català, Carles Ibáñez&lt;/p&gt;

In order to fill this gap, a study was conducted in a Mediterranean rice agrosystem (Ebre Delta, Catalonia) following a farm-to-farm approach with the purpose of 1) evaluating the cumulative and temporal pattern of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission, and 2) conducting a multi-variate analyses to assess the associative pattern, relative contribution and temporal variation of the main explanatory variables concerning the observed CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Measurements of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and agronomic and environmental parameters in 15 commercial rice fields were monitored monthly, during a whole crop field cycle. The temporal pattern of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission followed a bi-modal distribution peaking in August and October. The cumulative annual CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from rice fields amounted 314 kg CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, of which &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 70% were emitted during the fallow season. The main controlling factors of the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission rate in the growing season were positive related to water level and plant cover, while soil redox was negatively related. The main controlling factors in the fallow season were water level (negatively related, conversely to the growing season), as well as straw incorporation and soil temperature (positively related). The results of this study highlight the importance of the often neglected fallow season in the accurate estimation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and, thus, the necessity of measurement programs that cover the whole crop field cycle. This information is the first step for setting effective mitigation strategies based on straw and water management.</content></content><updated>1527800400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Maite Martínez-Eixarch</name></author><fingerprint>3341ec5</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198081</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198081</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761237:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197668</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Kutsuna, Junko Tomida, Yuji Morita, Yoshiaki Kawamura&lt;/p&gt;
Although it has been recognized that intestinal bacteria play an important role in the pathology of human ulcerative colitis (UC), specific pathogenic bacteria for UC have not been identified. We investigated the influence of &lt;i&gt;Paraclostridium bifermentans&lt;/i&gt; PAGU1678 strain on the pathology of a UC mouse model and found it increased UC pathosis scores such as loose and bloody stools, reduced diversity of fecal flora, disappearance of the crypt structure of distal colon tissue, destruction of intestinal epithelial cells, and atrophy of the colon. Furthermore, we observed an increase in &lt;i&gt;COX-2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF-α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;IL-17&lt;/i&gt; expression and a decrease in &lt;i&gt;Foxp3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; expression, as inflammation-related factors and inflammatory cytokines, a decrease in the concentration of short chain fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) in feces, and an increase of intestinal mucosal myeloperoxidase activity. These results suggest that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bifermentans&lt;/i&gt; PAGU1678 is a pathology-exacerbating factor in a mouse model of UC. This study is the first to demonstrate exacerbation of the pathological condition in a mouse model of UC by a single bacterial strain.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197668</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Paraclostridium bifermentans&amp;lt;/i&gt; exacerbates pathosis in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Kutsuna, Junko Tomida, Yuji Morita, Yoshiaki Kawamura&lt;/p&gt;

Because such experiments are resource-intensive and frequently push the limits of sensitivity of the measurement techniques, optimization of experiment design can improve feasibility with respect to financial and labor costs, time to completion, and increase precision and accuracy of the results. Here we used a previously published set of data acquired in cultured insulinoma cells to evaluate contributions to the sensitivity and variability of the rate of citrate synthase (CS). Specifically, we calculated changes in uncertainty in CS if sample times were dropped or new ones were added, and we observed that some sampling times can be dropped with little effect, while improvements can be made with a strategic choice of when to add samples. We measured the contributions of data sampled at different times on the sensitivity of CS, finding that CS had greater sensitivity at early time points. We tested the concept that if two estimated parameters are correlated significantly, then refining one might constrain the other. In this case, the rate of Beta-ox was found to be correlated with CS, and narrower variability in Beta-ox did indeed improve the sensitivity of CS. The tests described here might be applied at the initial design stage and then after a pilot phase to improve sensitivities of targeted fluxes and the reduction of materials, time, labor, and other experimental resources. The correlation analyses can be used to consider what orthogonal measurements might be beneficial for further improvement of measurements. While this study used a specific example of a set of time-dependent kinetic isotopic measurements, the results illustrate some generalizable behaviors that can be tested in other experimental systems.</description><published>1527404400000</published><fingerprint>740e68bf</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331520v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Determination of metabolic fluxes by measurement of time-dependent sampling of isotopic enrichments during the administration of labeled substrates provides rich information.

In this case, the rate of Beta-ox was found to be correlated with CS, and narrower variability in Beta-ox did indeed improve the sensitivity of CS. The tests described here might be applied at the initial design stage and then after a pilot phase to improve sensitivities of targeted fluxes and the reduction of materials, time, labor, and other experimental resources. The correlation analyses can be used to consider what orthogonal measurements might be beneficial for further improvement of measurements. While this study used a specific example of a set of time-dependent kinetic isotopic measurements, the results illustrate some generalizable behaviors that can be tested in other experimental systems.</content></content><title>Optimization of Experiment Design for Mass Spectrometric Isotopic Labeling Kinetics [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Lathwal, S.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/27/331520</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331520v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>6</engagement><crawled>1527239840082</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16396969152:286e49:7cfe07d6</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26585-0</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexible Organic Thin Film Transistors Incorporating a Biodegradable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Based Polymer as the Substrate and Dielectric Material&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexible Organic Thin Film Transistors Incorporating a Biodegradable CO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;-Based Polymer as the Substrate and Dielectric Material, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26585-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26585-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Flexible Organic Thin Film Transistors Incorporating a Biodegradable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Based Polymer as the Substrate and Dielectric Material&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/tB1MR1VTHc4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527231600000</published><fingerprint>897ddc1e</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26585-0</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexible Organic Thin Film Transistors Incorporating a Biodegradable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Based Polymer as the Substrate and Dielectric Material&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexible Organic Thin Film Transistors Incorporating a Biodegradable CO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;-Based Polymer as the Substrate and Dielectric Material, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26585-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26585-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Flexible Organic Thin Film Transistors Incorporating a Biodegradable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Based Polymer as the Substrate and Dielectric Material&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/tB1MR1VTHc4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Flexible Organic Thin Film Transistors Incorporating a Biodegradable CO2-Based Polymer as the Substrate and Dielectric Material</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26585-0/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26585_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><height>614</height></visual><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Cut Rullyani</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26585-0</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/tB1MR1VTHc4/s41598-018-26585-0</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c22:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198134</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seo Hee Choi, Hong In Yoon, Seung Hyun Kim, Sang Kyum Kim, Kyoo-Ho Shin, Chang-Ok Suh&lt;/p&gt;
Purpose &lt;p&gt;Although locally invasive or recurrent fibromatosis is primarily treated with surgery, radiotherapy (RT) produces local control for recurrent/unresectable tumors or those with positive surgical margins. Herein, we describe our updated institutional experience with RT to treat fibromatosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven patients with fibromatosis received RT between 1990 and 2015, and were followed for ≥12 months. Eight patients received RT for gross tumors, and 39 received postoperative RT after single/multiple prior surgeries. A median dose of 54 Gy was prescribed for definitive RT; 48.6, 50.4, and 54 Gy were prescribed for R0, R1, and R2 resected tumors, respectively. Recurrences were classified as in-field, marginal, or out-field. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven recurrences were noted, including 2 in-field, 4 marginal, and 1 out-field, after a median follow-up of 60 months. In-field recurrences occurred in 1 patient who received 40.5 Gy of salvage RT after postoperative recurrence and another who received 45 Gy for R1 resection after multiple prior operations. All marginal failures were due to insufficient clinical target volume (CTV) margins regardless of dose (3 with 45 Gy and 1 with 54 Gy). On multivariate analysis, a CTV margin ≥5 cm and dose &gt;45 Gy were significant predictors of non-recurrence (p = 0.039 and 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with both an CTV margin ≥5 cm and a dose &gt;45 Gy showed a favorable outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RT is a valuable option for treating aggressive fibromatosis; doses ≥45 Gy and a large field produce optimal results. For in-field control, a higher dose is more necessary for gross residual tumors than for totally excised lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198134</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Optimal radiotherapy strategy for primary or recurrent fibromatosis and long-term results</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seo Hee Choi, Hong In Yoon, Seung Hyun Kim, Sang Kyum Kim, Kyoo-Ho Shin, Chang-Ok Suh&lt;/p&gt;

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526590800000</published><fingerprint>4585a5bf</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006156</link><title>Firing-rate based network modeling of the dLGN circuit: Effects of cortical feedback on spatiotemporal response properties of relay cells</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Milad Hobbi Mobarhan, Geir Halnes, Pablo Martínez-Cañada, Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn, Gaute T.

Host Defense Peptides (HDPs) such as cathelicidins are multifunctional effectors of the innate immune system with both antimicrobial and pleiotropic immunomodulatory functions. Chicken cathelicidin-2 (CATH-2) has multiple immunomodulatory effects &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and the D-amino acid analog of this peptide has been shown to partially protect young chicks from a bacterial infection. However, the mechanisms responsible for CATH-2 mediated &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; protection have not been investigated so far. In this study, D-CATH-2 was administered &lt;i&gt;in ovo&lt;/i&gt; and the immune status and microbiota of the chicks were investigated at 7 days posthatch to elucidate the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; mechanisms of the peptide. In three consecutive studies, no effects on numbers and functions of immune cells were found and only small changes were seen in gene expression of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). In two studies, intestinal microbiota composition was determined which was highly variable, suggesting that it was strongly influenced by environmental factors. In both studies, &lt;i&gt;in ovo&lt;/i&gt; D-CATH-2 treatment caused significant reduction of Ruminococcaceae and &lt;i&gt;Butyricicoccus&lt;/i&gt; in the cecum and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia/Shigella&lt;/i&gt; in both ileum and cecum. In conclusion, this study shows that, in the absence of an infectious stimulus, &lt;i&gt;in ovo&lt;/i&gt; administration of a CATH-2 analog alters the microbiota composition but does not affect the chicks’ immune system posthatch.</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Immunomodulation and effects on microbiota after &amp;lt;i&gt;in ovo&amp;lt;/i&gt; administration of chicken cathelicidin-2</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tryntsje Cuperus, Marina D.

The adipose tissue (AT) contributes to systemic and B cell intrinsic inflammation, reduced B cell responses and secretion of autoimmune antibodies. In this study we show that adipocytes in the human obese subcutaneous AT (SAT) secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation, and consequent suboptimal immune responses in obese individuals, as we have previously shown. We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies. During the development of obesity, reduced oxygen and consequent hypoxia and cell death lead to further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, “self” protein antigens, cell-free DNA and lipids. All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of “self” antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197472</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Secretion of autoimmune antibodies in the human subcutaneous adipose tissue</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Frasca, Alain Diaz, Maria Romero, Seth Thaller, Bonnie B.

Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Daniela Frasca</name></author><fingerprint>87853ac7</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197472</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197472</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02134/20180508/images/medium/jp-2018-02134n_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02134&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Although studies from pediatric cancers (largely acute lymphoblastic leukemia) have shown that patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy may experience decreased growth velocity during the treatment phase, no such data exist for retinoblastoma patients treated with systemic chemotherapy or ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC). The purpose of this study is to report growth patterns of our retinoblastoma (Rb) population who were treated with OAC in a retrospective, single center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) review of 341 patients treated between 2006 and 2016. Children who only received OAC were classified as naive; those who were treated initially with systemic chemotherapy and subsequently presented to our center for OAC were termed secondary; and a small group of patients who received single-agent systemic chemotherapy prior to OAC were labeled bridge. For all patients, height and weight were recorded at monthly intervals during OAC (short-term) and then annually during a follow-up period (long-term) up to 3 years after treatment. Excluded from this study were children who received external radiation therapy and those with genetic syndromes, which are independently associated with growth derangements. During OAC, there was no significant difference in growth velocity between the naïve and secondary groups. In either group, number of treatments also did not affect growth rate. Three years after the end of OAC, naïve patients were in the 68&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile by height (95% CI 61.30, 74.63) compared to secondary patients in the 61&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 51.1, 71.47). Both groups were in the same weight percentiles during the first two years of follow-up but at the three-year follow-up period, naïve patients were in the 63&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 57.4, 69.4) and secondary patients were in the 60&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 50.4, 69.7). OAC for retinoblastoma does not appear to impact short-term growth velocity, weight gain during the treatment period or after three years.</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197052</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Growth patterns of survivors of retinoblastoma treated with ophthalmic artery chemosurgery</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sruti S.

We used MutSigCV and OncodriveFM modules implemented in the IntOGen pipeline to identify consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts comprising 1,494 samples in total. To access their global impacts, we used TCGA mutations and copy number variations to predict the transcriptomics data, under generalized linear models.

Integrative analysis of driver mutations, copy number variations and transcriptomic data reveals that these consensus driver mutations and their copy number variations are associated with majority (62.5%) of the mRNA transcriptome, but only a small fraction (8.9%) of miRNAs. Genes associated with TP53, CTNNB1, and ARID1A mutations contribute to the tripod of most densely connected pathway clusters.

The interplay with bacteria is of crucial importance for the interaction of multicellular organisms with their environments. Studying the associations between the nematode model organisms &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus pacificus&lt;/i&gt; with bacteria constitutes a powerful system to investigate these interactions at a mechanistic level. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt; is found in association with scarab beetles in nature and recent studies revealed the succession and dynamics of this nematode and its microbiome during the decomposition of one particular host species, the rhinoceros beetle &lt;i&gt;Oryctes borbonicus&lt;/i&gt; on La Réunion Island. However, these studies were performed using culture-free methods, with no attempt made to establish bacterial cultures from the beetle-nematode ecosystem and to investigate the effects of these microbes on life history traits in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we establish and characterize a collection of 136 bacterial strains that have been isolated from scarab beetles and figs, another &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus&lt;/i&gt;-associated environment, as a resource for studying their effect on various nematode traits. Classification based on 16S sequencing identified members of four bacterial phyla with the class of Gammaproteobacteria representing the majority with 81 strains.

Furthermore, these results will form the basis of future studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of recognition and pathogenicity.</content></content><updated>1528146000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Nermin Akduman</name></author><fingerprint>953a587c</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198018</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198018</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>78</engagement><crawled>1527088744633</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1638d9508b9:7448067:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05213-x</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hong Kong builds a science-based future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong builds a science-based future, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05213-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05213-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The city is using its proximity to research and development hubs in mainland China to encourage innovation, but barriers to collaboration remain.</description><published>1527058800000</published><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05213-x</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hong Kong builds a science-based future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong builds a science-based future, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05213-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05213-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The city is using its proximity to research and development hubs in mainland China to encourage innovation, but barriers to collaboration remain.</content></content><title>Hong Kong builds a science-based future</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05213-x/d41586-018-05213-x_15773832.jpg</url><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>Jack Leeming</name></author><fingerprint>2fd3ab51</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05213-x</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e2f:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197980</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Liu, Wei Chen, Qi Zhang, Xiaoli Yan, Fei Zhang, Tianhua Dong, Guang Yang, Yingze Zhang&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine the association between preoperational factors and patients’ short-term outcome after proximal fibular osteotomy (PFO) and to provide a basis for detailed surgical indication and patient selection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing PFO between January 2015 and December 2015. Preoperational clinical data including gender, age, duration of disease, visual analogue score (VAS) and American Knee Society (KSS) score were collected. The radiological factors including hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA angle), condyle-plateau angle (CP angle), Kellgren and Lawrence grade (KL grade), joint space width of both compartments and settlement value were also considered. Patients were followed for at 12 months postoperatively. Both clinical and functional KSS scores were obtained. The outcome of interest was divided into clinical outcome and functional outcome. For each, two criteria were defined: satisfaction and significant improvement. Satisfaction is characterized by a KSS clinical or functional score over 70 points (excellent and good results); significant improvement refers to an increase in KSS scores of more than 15 points. Bivariate logistic regression for the association between preoperational factors and outcomes of interest was performed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to detect the independent factors affecting the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 84 patients and 111 knees were followed-up. Of these, 17 knees were from males and 94 were from females. The average age was 59.45±8.82 years. The average preoperational VAS score, KSS clinical and functional score were 7.08±1.41 points, 49.14±10.95 points and 44.97±17.71 points, respectively. According to KL grading, there were 17 knees of grade 2, 47 knees of grade 3, and 47 knees of grade 4. In clinical outcomes, there were 51 knees in the satisfaction group and 77 knees in the significant improvement group. In functional outcomes, 43 knees were in the satisfaction group and 76 knees in the significant improvement group. KSS clinical score (OR = 1.134, 95%CI = 1.067–1.205, P = 0.000) was the independent factor associated with clinical satisfaction. Age (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.000–1.150, P = 0.048), VAS score (OR = 1.679, 95%CI = 1.041–2.706, P = 0.033), KSS clinical (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.005–1.144, P = 0.034) and functional (OR = 1.100, 95%CI = 1.044–1.159, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.345, 95%CI = 1.119–1.617, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 7.540, 95%CI = 1.307–43.484, P = 0.024) were the independent factors associated with functional satisfaction. KSS clinical (OR = 0.905, 95%CI = 0.850–0.963, P = 0.002) score, CP angle (OR = 0.760, 95%CI = 0.593–0.973, P = 0.030) and medial joint space width (OR = 0.001, 95%CI = 0.000–0.107, P = 0.003) were the independent factors associated with significant clinical improvement; VAS score (OR = 1.582, 95%CI = 1.042–2.402, P = 0.031), KSS functional (OR = 0.888, 95%CI = 0.838–0.942, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.292, 95%CI = 1.101–1.518, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 9.990, 95%CI = 1.485–67.197, P = 0.018) were the independent factors associated with significant functional improvement.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The independent factors affecting postoperative clinical outcome after PFO were KSS clinical score, CP angle and medial joint space width. In addition, the independent factors that influenced functional outcome included age, VAS score, KSS score, HKA angle and settlement value. As objective radiological evidence, HKA angle and settlement value could be used as an important basis for patient selection for PFO.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197980</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Proximal fibular osteotomy to treat medial compartment knee osteoarthritis: Preoperational factors for short-term prognosis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Liu, Wei Chen, Qi Zhang, Xiaoli Yan, Fei Zhang, Tianhua Dong, Guang Yang, Yingze Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper, we propose a novel classification model for automatically identifying individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) using retinal features from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) images. Our classification method uses retinal features such as the thickness of the retina and the thickness of the individual retinal layers, and the volume of the pathologies such as drusen and hyper-reflective intra-retinal spots. We extract automatically, ten clinically important retinal features by segmenting individual SD-OCT images for classification purposes. The effectiveness of the extracted features is evaluated using several classification methods such as Random Forrest on 251 (59 normal, 177 AMD and 15 DME) subjects. We have performed 15-fold cross-validation tests for three phenotypes; DME, AMD and normal cases using these data sets and achieved accuracy of more than 95% on each data set with the classification method using Random Forrest. When we trained the system as a two-class problem of normal and eye with pathology, using the Random Forrest classifier, we obtained an accuracy of more than 96%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) finds a value of 0.99 for each dataset. We have also shown the performance of four state-of-the-methods for classification the eye participants and found that our proposed method showed the best accuracy.</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198281</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Classification of healthy and diseased retina using SD-OCT imaging and Random Forest algorithm</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Md Akter Hussain, Alauddin Bhuiyan, Chi D.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We assessed for the first time whether urinary free light chains (FLC) are independently associated with risk of ESRD in patients with CKD, and whether they offer incremental value in risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We measured urinary FLCs in 556 patients with CKD from a prospective cohort study. The association between urinary kappa/creatinine (KCR) and lambda/creatinine (LCR) ratios and development of ESRD was assessed by competing-risks regression (to account for the competing risk of death). The change in C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement were used to assess the incremental value of adding KCR or LCR to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;136 participants developed ESRD during a median follow-up time of 51 months. Significant associations between KCR and LCR and risk of ESRD became non-significant after adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), although having a KCR or LCR &gt;75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centile remained independently associated with risk of ESRD. Neither KCR nor LCR as continuous or categorical variables provided incremental value when added to the KFRE for estimating risk of ESRD at two years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Urinary FLCs have an association with progression to ESRD in patients with CKD which appears to be explained to a degree by their correlation with eGFR and ACR.

Together, these results indicate that MD-AD is particularly useful for learning expressive network representations from heterogeneous and sparsely labeled AD data.</content></content><title>MD-AD: Multi-task deep learning for Alzheimer&apos;s disease neuropathology [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Beebe-Wang, N.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/27/331942</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331942v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527845332130</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163baada4a2:3727a86:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04642-6</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Ultra-thin enzymatic liquid membrane for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation and capture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Ultra-thin enzymatic liquid membrane for CO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; separation and capture, Published online: 01 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04642-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04642-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Ultra-thin enzymatic liquid membrane for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation and capture&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/RMcvgZeHV4o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527836400000</published><fingerprint>830c0135</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04642-6</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Ultra-thin enzymatic liquid membrane for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation and capture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Ultra-thin enzymatic liquid membrane for CO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; separation and capture, Published online: 01 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04642-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04642-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Ultra-thin enzymatic liquid membrane for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation and capture&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/RMcvgZeHV4o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Author Correction: Ultra-thin enzymatic liquid membrane for CO2 separation and capture</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Yaqin Fu</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04642-6</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/RMcvgZeHV4o/s41467-018-04642-6</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7215:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194973</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adeline Heraudeau, Aurélien Delluc, Mickaël Le Henaff, Karine Lacut, Christophe Leroyer, Benoit Desrues, Francis Couturaud, Cécile Tromeur&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Cancer and factor V Leiden mutation are both risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Cancer critically increases the thrombotic risk whereas Factor V Leiden is the most common pro-thrombotic mutation. The impact of the factor V Leiden on the risk of VTE in cancer patients remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the impact of factor V Leiden mutation in cancer-associated thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The EDITH hospital-based case-control study enrolled 182 patients with cancer and VTE as well as 182 control patients with cancer, matched for gender, age and cancer location, between 2000 and 2012, in the University Hospital of Brest. All cases and controls were genotyped for the factor V Leiden mutation and interviewed with a standardized questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty one of 182 (11.5%) patients with cancer-associated thrombosis carried the factor V Leiden mutation and 4 of 182 (2.2%) controls with cancer but no venous thrombosis. In multivariate analysis including cancer stage and family history of VTE, cancer patients with factor V Leiden mutation had a seven-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.04; 95% CI, 2.01–24.63).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The pro-thrombotic Factor V Leiden mutation was found to be an independent additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism in cancer patients and might therefore be considered in the individual thrombotic risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194973</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Risk of venous thromboembolism in association with factor V leiden in cancer patients – The EDITH case-control study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Adeline Heraudeau, Aurélien Delluc, Mickaël Le Henaff, Karine Lacut, Christophe Leroyer, Benoit Desrues, Francis Couturaud, Cécile Tromeur&lt;/p&gt;

Methods: This article presents a semi-supervise encoding approach (super-encoding) for constructing a non-linear exemplar data distribution from EHR data and detecting non-conforming observations as outliers. Two hypotheses are tested using experimental design and non-parametric hypothesis testing procedures to evaluate the outlier detection performance of the semi-supervised encoding approach and increasing demographic precision in encoding. Results: The experiments involved applying 492 encoders to 30 laboratory tests extracted from the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) from Partners HealthCare. We report results obtained from 14,760 encoders. The semi-supervised encoders (super-encoders) outperformed conventional autoencoders in outlier detection. Adding age at observation to the baseline encoder (that only included observation value as the feature) slightly improved outlier detection. Top-nine performing encoders are introduced. The best outlier detection performance was from a semi-supervised encoder, with observation value as the single feature and a single hidden layer, built on one percent of the data and one percent reconstruction error. At least one encoder had a Youden J index higher than 0.9999 for all 30 observations.

The scRNA-seq data provide us with detailed information about the cellular states but, despite several pioneering efforts, it remains an open research question how regulatory networks could be inferred from these noisy discrete read count data. Results: Here, we introduce a hierarchical regression model which is designed for detecting dependencies in scRNA-seq and other count data. We model count data using the Poisson-log normal distribution and, by means of our hierarchical formulation, detect the dependencies between genes using linear regression model for the latent, cell-specific gene expression rate parameters. The hierarchical formulation allows us to model count data without artificial data transformations and makes it possible to incorporate normalization information directly into the latent layer of the model. We test the proposed approach using both simulated and experimental data. Our results show that the proposed approach performs better than standard regression techniques in parameter inference task as well as in variable selection task.</description><published>1527750000000</published><fingerprint>899c7be2</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335695v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Modern single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have made it possible to measure the RNA content of individual cells.

The hierarchical formulation allows us to model count data without artificial data transformations and makes it possible to incorporate normalization information directly into the latent layer of the model. We test the proposed approach using both simulated and experimental data. Our results show that the proposed approach performs better than standard regression techniques in parameter inference task as well as in variable selection task.</content></content><title>SCHiRM: Single Cell Hierarchical Regression Model to detect dependencies in read count data [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Intosalmi, J.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/31/335695</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335695v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7d0:93d646dc</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-s?rss=1</originId><published>1525974002000</published><fingerprint>abd2cf63</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-s?rss=1</link><title>Spinal cord stem cell grafts in pigs</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Maroso, M.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.19.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-s?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>98</engagement><crawled>1526924854361</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16383d04459:d57e0:d63e3ae2</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003864</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Evan Quon, Yves Y.

Tether proteins attach the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to other cellular membranes, thereby creating contact sites that are proposed to form platforms for regulating lipid homeostasis and facilitating non-vesicular lipid exchange. Sterols are synthesized in the ER and transported by non-vesicular mechanisms to the plasma membrane (PM), where they represent almost half of all PM lipids and contribute critically to the barrier function of the PM. To determine whether contact sites are important for both sterol exchange between the ER and PM and intermembrane regulation of lipid metabolism, we generated Δ-super-tether (Δ-s-tether) yeast cells that lack six previously identified tethering proteins (yeast extended synatotagmin [E-Syt], vesicle-associated membrane protein [VAMP]-associated protein [VAP], and TMEM16-anoctamin homologues) as well as the presumptive tether Ice2. Despite the lack of ER-PM contacts in these cells, ER-PM sterol exchange is robust, indicating that the sterol transport machinery is either absent from or not uniquely located at contact sites. Unexpectedly, we found that the transport of exogenously supplied sterol to the ER occurs more slowly in Δ-s-tether cells than in wild-type (WT) cells. We pinpointed this defect to changes in sterol organization and transbilayer movement within the PM bilayer caused by phospholipid dysregulation, evinced by changes in the abundance and organization of PM lipids. Indeed, deletion of either &lt;i&gt;OSH4&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a sterol/phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) exchange protein, or &lt;i&gt;SAC1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a PI4P phosphatase, caused synthetic lethality in Δ-s-tether cells due to disruptions in redundant PI4P and phospholipid regulatory pathways. The growth defect of Δ-s-tether cells was rescued with an artificial &amp;quot;ER-PM staple,&amp;quot; a tether assembled from unrelated non-yeast protein domains, indicating that endogenous tether proteins have nonspecific bridging functions. Finally, we discovered that sterols play a role in regulating ER-PM contact site formation. In sterol-depleted cells, levels of the yeast E-Syt tether Tcb3 were induced and ER-PM contact increased dramatically. These results support a model in which ER-PM contact sites provide a nexus for coordinating the complex interrelationship between sterols, sphingolipids, and phospholipids that maintain PM composition and integrity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OHq9avpWuLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526936400000</published><fingerprint>3b2a73ba</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003864</link><title>Endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane contact sites integrate sterol and phospholipid regulation</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Evan Quon, Yves Y.

Adult stem cells are considered multipotent, restricted to differentiate into a few tissue-specific cell types. With the advent of technologies which can dedifferentiate and transdifferentiate cell types, assumptions about the process of cell fate determination must be reconsidered, including the role of extrinsic versus intrinsic factors. To determine the plasticity of adult neural progenitors, rat hippocampal progenitor cells were xenotransplanted into embryonic zebrafish. These animals allow for easy detection of transplanted cells due to their external development and transparency at early stages. Adult neural progenitors were observed throughout the zebrafish for the duration of the experiment (at least five days post-transplantation). While the majority of transplanted cells were observed in the central nervous system, a large percentage of cells were located in superficial tissues. However, approximately one-third of these cells retained neural morphology and expression of the neuronal marker, Class III β-tubulin, indicating that the transplanted adult neural progenitors did not adapt alternate fates. A very small subset of cells demonstrated unique, non-neural flattened morphology, suggesting that adult neural progenitors may exhibit plasticity in this model, though at a very low rate. These findings demonstrate that the developing zebrafish may be an efficient model to explore plasticity of a variety of adult stem cell types and the role of external factors on cell fate.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198025</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Xenotransplantation of adult hippocampal neural progenitors into the developing zebrafish for assessment of stem cell plasticity</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth J.

The red algal subclass Nemaliophycidae includes both marine and freshwater taxa that contribute to more than half of the freshwater species in Rhodophyta. Given that these taxa inhabit diverse habitats, the Nemaliophycidae is a suitable model for studying environmental adaptation. For this purpose, we characterized plastid genomes of two freshwater species, &lt;i&gt;Kumanoa americana&lt;/i&gt; (Batrachospermales) and &lt;i&gt;Thorea hispida&lt;/i&gt; (Thoreales), and one marine species &lt;i&gt;Palmaria palmata&lt;/i&gt; (Palmariales). Comparative genome analysis identified seven genes (&lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;46, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;91, &lt;i&gt;grx&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A) that were different among marine and freshwater species. Among currently available red algal plastid genomes (127), four genes (&lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37) were retained in most of the marine species. Among these, the &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A gene, known for encoding heme oxygenase, had two additional copies (&lt;i&gt;HMOX1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HMOX2&lt;/i&gt;) that were newly discovered and were reported from previously red algal nuclear genomes. Each type of heme oxygenase had a different evolutionary history and special modifications (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., plastid targeting signal peptide). Based on this observation, we suggest that the plastid-encoded &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A contributes to the iron controlling system in iron-deprived conditions. Thus, we highlight that this functional requirement may have prevented gene loss during the long evolutionary history of red algal plastid genomes.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196995</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Plastid genome analysis of three Nemaliophycidae red algal species suggests environmental adaptation for iron limited habitats</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chung Hyun Cho, Ji Won Choi, Daryl W.

Recent experiments showed that engineered &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; colonies grow and self-organize into periodic stripes with high and low cell densities in semi-solid agar. The stripes develop sequentially behind a radially propagating colony front, similar to the formation of many other periodic patterns in nature. These bacteria were created by genetically coupling the intracellular chemotaxis pathway of wild-type cells with a quorum sensing module through the protein CheZ. In this paper, we develop multiscale models to investigate how this intracellular pathway affects stripe formation. We first develop a detailed hybrid model that treats each cell as an individual particle and incorporates intracellular signaling via an internal ODE system. To overcome the computational cost of the hybrid model caused by the large number of cells involved, we next derive a mean-field PDE model from the hybrid model using asymptotic analysis. We show that this analysis is justified by the tight agreement between the PDE model and the hybrid model in 1D simulations. Numerical simulations of the PDE model in 2D with radial symmetry agree with experimental data semi-quantitatively. Finally, we use the PDE model to make a number of testable predictions on how the stripe patterns depend on cell-level parameters, including cell speed, cell doubling time and the turnover rate of intracellular CheZ.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s7yiJrNeGjk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1528146000000</published><fingerprint>cbe379cc</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006178</link><title>The role of intracellular signaling in the stripe formation in engineered &amp;lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; populations</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoru Xue, Chuan Xue, Min Tang&lt;/p&gt;

Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) constitutes one of the most important food fish in Japan; accordingly, genome sequencing and linkage mapping have been conducted for the purpose of artificial cultivation. In the next stage, integration of genomic sequences within linkage groups (LG) is required to construct higher-resolution genetic markers for quantitative trait loci mapping and selective breeding of beneficial traits in farming. In order to identify LG1-linked scaffolds from the draft genome assembly (323,776 scaffolds) reported previously, we attempted to isolate chromosomes corresponding to LG1 by flow sorting and subsequent analyses. Initially, single chromosomes were randomly collected by chromosome sorting and subjected to whole-genome amplification (WGA). A total of 60 WGA samples were screened by PCR with primers for a known LG1-linked scaffold, and five positive WGA samples were sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Following reference mapping analysis of the NGS reads, four of the five WGA samples were found to be enriched by LG1-linked sequences. These samples were cytogenetically assigned to chromosome 5 by fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization. Using blastn searches with 82,081 contigs constructed from the NGS reads of the four WGA samples as queries, 2323 scaffolds were identified as putative LG1-linked scaffolds from the draft genome assembly. The total length of the putative LG1-linked scaffolds was 99.0 Mb, comparable to the estimated DNA amounts of chromosome 5 (91.1 Mb). These results suggest that the methodology developed herein is applicable to isolate specific chromosome DNAs and integrate unanchored scaffold sequences onto a particular LG and chromosome even in teleost fishes, in which isolation of specific chromosomes by flow sorting is generally difficult owing to similar morphologies, sizes, and GC-contents among chromosomes in the genome. The putative LG1-linked scaffolds of Japanese eel contain a total of 6833 short tandem repeats which will be available for higher-resolution linkage mapping.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197040</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Identification of genetic linkage group 1-linked sequences in Japanese eel (&amp;lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&amp;lt;/i&gt;) by single chromosome sorting and sequencing</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kazumi Matsubara, Yuki Iwasaki, Issei Nishiki, Kazuharu Nomura, Atushi Fujiwara&lt;/p&gt;

The assumptions behind this hypothesis as well as its consequences for experimental and theoretical biology are discussed.</content></content><engagementRate>1.0</engagementRate><title>On an algorithmic definition for the components of the minimal cell [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Martinez, O.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/30/333682</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333682v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01096/20180524/images/medium/mp-2017-010964_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01096&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Elevated serum uric acid (sUA) concentrations are common in the general population and are associated with chronic metabolic conditions and adverse clinical outcomes. We evaluated secular trends in the burden of hyperuricaemia from 2006–2014 within the Irish health system.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the &lt;i&gt;National Kidney Disease Surveillance Programme&lt;/i&gt; was used to determine the prevalence of elevated sUA in adults, age &gt; 18 years, within the Irish health system. Hyperuricaemia was defined as sUA &gt; 416.4 μmol/L in men and &gt; 339.06 μmol/L in women, and prevalence was calculated as the proportion of patients per year with mean sUA levels above sex-specific thresholds. Temporal trends in prevalence were compared from 2006 to 2014 while general estimating equations (GEE) explored variation across calendar years expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2014, prevalence of hyperuricaemia increased from 19.7% to 25.0% in men and from 20.5% to 24.1% in women, P&amp;lt;0.001. The corresponding sUA concentrations increased significantly from 314.6 (93.9) in 2006 to 325.6 (96.2) in 2014, P&amp;lt;0.001. Age-specific prevalence increased in all groups from 2006 to 2014, and the magnitude of increase was similar for each age category. Adjusting for baseline demographic characteristics and illness indicators, the likelihood of hyperuricemia was greatest for patients in 2014; OR 1.45 (1.26–1.65) for men and OR 1.47 (1.29–1.67) in women vs 2006 (referent). Factors associated with hyperuricaemia included: worsening kidney function, elevated white cell count, raised serum phosphate and calcium levels, elevated total protein and higher haemoglobin concentrations, all P&amp;lt;0.001.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The burden of hyperuricaemia is substantial in the Irish health system and has increased in frequency over the past decade. Advancing age, poorer kidney function, measures of nutrition and inflammation, and regional variation all contribute to increasing prevalence, but these do not fully explain emerging trends.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198197</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Temporal trends in hyperuricaemia in the Irish health system from 2006-2014: A cohort study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arun Kumar A.

Temporal trends in prevalence were compared from 2006 to 2014 while general estimating equations (GEE) explored variation across calendar years expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2014, prevalence of hyperuricaemia increased from 19.7% to 25.0% in men and from 20.5% to 24.1% in women, P&amp;lt;0.001. The corresponding sUA concentrations increased significantly from 314.6 (93.9) in 2006 to 325.6 (96.2) in 2014, P&amp;lt;0.001. Age-specific prevalence increased in all groups from 2006 to 2014, and the magnitude of increase was similar for each age category. Adjusting for baseline demographic characteristics and illness indicators, the likelihood of hyperuricemia was greatest for patients in 2014; OR 1.45 (1.26–1.65) for men and OR 1.47 (1.29–1.67) in women vs 2006 (referent). Factors associated with hyperuricaemia included: worsening kidney function, elevated white cell count, raised serum phosphate and calcium levels, elevated total protein and higher haemoglobin concentrations, all P&amp;lt;0.001.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The burden of hyperuricaemia is substantial in the Irish health system and has increased in frequency over the past decade. Advancing age, poorer kidney function, measures of nutrition and inflammation, and regional variation all contribute to increasing prevalence, but these do not fully explain emerging trends.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527800400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Arun Kumar A.

Xenin, a highly conserved 25 amino acid peptide cleaved from the N-terminus of the coatomer protein alpha (COPA), is emerging as a food intake regulator in mammals and birds. To date, no research has been conducted on xenin biology in fish. This study aims to identify the &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA encoding xenin in goldfish (&lt;i&gt;Carassius auratus&lt;/i&gt;) as a model, to elucidate its regulation by feeding, and to describe the role of xenin on appetite. First, a partial sequence of &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; cDNA, a region encoding xenin, was identified from goldfish brain. This sequence is highly conserved among both vertebrates and invertebrates. RT-qPCR revealed that &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs are widely distributed in goldfish tissues, with the highest levels detected in the brain, gill, pituitary and J-loop. Immunohistochemistry confirmed also the presence of COPA peptide in the hypothalamus and enteroendocrine cells on the J-loop mucosa. In line with its anorexigenic effects, we found important periprandial fluctuations in &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, which were mainly characterized by a gradually decrease in &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels as the feeding time was approached, and a gradual increase after feeding. Additionally, fasting differently modulated the expression of &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in a tissue-dependent manner. Peripheral and central injections of xenin reduce food intake in goldfish. This research provides the first report of xenin in fish, and shows that this peptide is a novel anorexigen in goldfish.</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197817</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Xenin is a novel anorexigen in goldfish (&amp;lt;i&gt;Carassius auratus&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Brent Kerbel, Kimberly Badal, Lakshminarasimhan Sundarrajan, Ayelen Blanco, Suraj Unniappan&lt;/p&gt;

This paper is concerned with the potential multistability of protein concentrations in the cell. That is, situations where one, or a family of, proteins may sit at one of two or more different steady state concentrations in otherwise identical cells, and in spite of them being in the same environment. For models of multisite protein phosphorylation for example, in the presence of excess substrate, it has been shown that the achievable number of stable steady states can increase linearly with the number of phosphosites available. In this paper, we analyse the consequences of adding enzyme docking to these and similar models, with the resultant sequestration of phosphatase and kinase by the fully unphosphorylated and by the fully phosphorylated substrates respectively. In the large molecule numbers limit, where deterministic analysis is applicable, we prove that there are always values for these rates of sequestration which, when exceeded, limit the extent of multistability. For the models considered here, these numbers are much smaller than the affinity of the enzymes to the substrate when it is in a modifiable state. As substrate enzyme-sequestration is increased, we further prove that the number of steady states will inevitably be reduced to one. For smaller molecule numbers a stochastic analysis is more appropriate, where multistability in the large molecule numbers limit can manifest itself as multimodality of the probability distribution; the system spending periods of time in the vicinity of one mode before jumping to another. Here, we find that substrate enzyme sequestration can induce bimodality even in systems where only a single steady state can exist at large numbers. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a weakly chained diagonally dominant M-matrix formulation of the Chemical Master Equation, allowing greater insights in the way particular mechanisms, like enzyme sequestration, can shape probability distributions and therefore exhibit different behaviour across different regimes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2a3YD9EnPsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526590800000</published><fingerprint>f2cc0daa</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006107</link><title>Enzyme sequestration by the substrate: An analysis in the deterministic and stochastic domains</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Petrides, Glenn Vinnicombe&lt;/p&gt;

Global trade and the movement of people accelerate biological invasions by spreading species worldwide. Biosecurity measures seek to allow trade and passenger movements while preventing incursions that could lead to the establishment of unwanted pests, pathogens, and weeds. However, few data exist to evaluate whether changes in trade volumes, passenger arrivals, and biosecurity measures have altered rates of establishment of nonnative species over time. This is particularly true for pathogens, which pose significant risks to animal and plant health and are consequently a major focus of biosecurity efforts but are difficult to detect. Here, we use a database of all known plant pathogen associations recorded in New Zealand to estimate the rate at which new fungal pathogens arrived and established on 131 economically important plant species over the last 133 years. We show that the annual arrival rate of new fungal pathogens increased from 1880 to about 1980 in parallel with increasing import trade volume but subsequently stabilised despite continued rapid growth in import trade and recent rapid increases in international passenger arrivals. Nevertheless, while pathogen arrival rates for crop and pasture species have declined in recent decades, arrival rates have increased for forestry and fruit tree species. These contrasting trends between production sectors reflect differences in biosecurity effort and suggest that targeted biosecurity can slow pathogen arrival and establishment despite increasing trade and international movement of people.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wB5iS5OD44s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527800400000</published><fingerprint>26f2347c</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006025</link><title>Import volumes and biosecurity interventions shape the arrival rate of fungal pathogens</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin A.

Muscle wasting occurs during various chronic diseases and precedes death in humans as in mice. The evaluation of the degree of muscle atrophy in diseased mouse models is often overlooked since it requires the sacrifice of the animals for muscle examination or expensive instrumentation and highly qualified personnel, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Very often behavioral tests for muscle strength evaluation are used as an outcome measurement in preclinical therapeutic trials. However, these tests are easy to perform serially, but not enough sensitive to detect early muscle changes during disease progression. Monitoring muscle loss in living animals could allow to perform more informative preclinical trials with a better evaluation of therapeutic benefit with respect to muscle wasting. We developed a non-invasive procedure based on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) without contrast agents to monitor hind limb muscle wasting in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cancer cachexia: the transgenic SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse and the colon adenocarcinoma C26-bearing mouse, respectively. We established the scanning procedure and the parameters to consider in the reconstructed images to calculate the Index of Muscle Mass (IMM). The coefficient of variance for the whole procedure was 2.2%. We performed longitudinally micro-CT scan of hind limbs in SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice at presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of the disease and calculated the IMM. We found that IMM in SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice was lower than age-matched controls even before symptom onset. We also detected a further decrease in IMM as disease progresses, most markedly just before disease onset. We performed the same analyses in the C26-based mouse model losing quickly body and muscle mass because of cancer cachexia. Overall, we found that the reduced muscle content detected by micro-CT mirrored the reduced muscle weight in both disease models. We developed a fast, precise and easy-to-conduct imaging procedure to monitor hind limb muscle mass, useful in therapeutic preclinical trials but also in proof-of-principle studies to identify the onset of muscle wasting. This method could be widely applied to other disease models characterized by muscle wasting, to assist drug development and search for early biomarkers of muscle atrophy. Moreover, reducing the number of mice needed for the experiments and being less distressing are in line with the 3R principle embodied in national and international directives for animal research.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198089</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Micro-computed tomography for non-invasive evaluation of muscle atrophy in mouse models of disease</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Pasetto, Davide Olivari, Giovanni Nardo, Maria Chiara Trolese, Caterina Bendotti, Rosanna Piccirillo, Valentina Bonetto&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The standard clinical approach to non-occupational HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) focuses on biomedical aspects of the intervention, but may overlook co-occurring or ‘syndemic’ psychosocial problems that reinforce future vulnerability to HIV. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence of syndemic health problems in a cohort of Ontario nPEP patients, and explored the relationship between syndemic burden and HIV risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between 07/2013-08/2016, we distributed a self-administered questionnaire to patients presenting to three clinics in Toronto and Ottawa seeking nPEP for sexual HIV exposures. We used validated screening tools to estimate the prevalence of depression (CES-D score ≥16), harmful alcohol use (AUDIT ≥8), problematic drug use (DUDIT ≥6 men/≥2 women), and sexual compulsivity (SCS ≥24) among men who have sex with men (MSM) respondents. In exploratory analyses, we examined the relationships between syndemic conditions using univariable logistic regression models, and the relationship between syndemic count (total number of syndemic conditions per participant) and HIV risk, as estimated by the HIRI-MSM score, using linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The 186 MSM included in the analysis had median age 31 (IQR = 26–36), including 87.6% having a college/undergraduate degree or higher. Overall, 53.8% screened positive for depression, 34.4% for harmful alcohol use, 30.1% for problematic drug use, and 16.1% for sexual compulsivity.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The standard clinical approach to non-occupational HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) focuses on biomedical aspects of the intervention, but may overlook co-occurring or ‘syndemic’ psychosocial problems that reinforce future vulnerability to HIV. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence of syndemic health problems in a cohort of Ontario nPEP patients, and explored the relationship between syndemic burden and HIV risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between 07/2013-08/2016, we distributed a self-administered questionnaire to patients presenting to three clinics in Toronto and Ottawa seeking nPEP for sexual HIV exposures. We used validated screening tools to estimate the prevalence of depression (CES-D score ≥16), harmful alcohol use (AUDIT ≥8), problematic drug use (DUDIT ≥6 men/≥2 women), and sexual compulsivity (SCS ≥24) among men who have sex with men (MSM) respondents. In exploratory analyses, we examined the relationships between syndemic conditions using univariable logistic regression models, and the relationship between syndemic count (total number of syndemic conditions per participant) and HIV risk, as estimated by the HIRI-MSM score, using linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The 186 MSM included in the analysis had median age 31 (IQR = 26–36), including 87.6% having a college/undergraduate degree or higher. Overall, 53.8% screened positive for depression, 34.4% for harmful alcohol use, 30.1% for problematic drug use, and 16.1% for sexual compulsivity. Most participants (74.2%) had at least one syndemic condition and 46.8% had more than one. Exploratory analyses suggested positive associations between depression and harmful alcohol use (OR = 2.11, 95%CI = 1.13, 3.94) and between harmful alcohol use and problematic drug use (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 0.65, 2.29). Syndemic count was associated with increased HIRI-MSM risk scores in univariable (2.2, 95%CI = 1.0, 3.3 per syndemic condition) and multivariable (2.1, 95%CI = 0.6, 3.6) linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of syndemic conditions in MSM seeking nPEP for sexual exposure is alarmingly high, and is associated with underlying HIV risk. Routine screening for these conditions may identify opportunities for intervention and could alleviate future vulnerability to HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Steven A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids (OCSFA) have been associated with potential health benefits. Although some OCSFA (e.g., C15:0 and C17:0) are found in meats and dairy products, sources and metabolism of C19:0 and C23:0 are relatively unknown, and the influence of non-dietary determinants, including genetic factors, on circulating levels of OCSFA is not established.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biological processes that influence circulating levels of OCSFA by investigating associations between genetic variation and OCSFA.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma phospholipid/erythrocyte levels of C15:0, C17:0, C19:0, and C23:0 among 11,494 individuals of European descent. We also investigated relationships between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lactase (&lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt;) gene, associated with adult-onset lactase intolerance, with circulating levels of dairy-derived OCSFA, and evaluated associations of candidate sphingolipid genes with C23:0 levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found no genome-wide significant evidence that common genetic variation is associated with circulating levels of C15:0 or C23:0. In two cohorts with available data, we identified one intronic SNP (rs13361131) in myosin X gene (&lt;i&gt;MYO10)&lt;/i&gt; associated with C17:0 level (P = 1.37×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;), and two intronic SNP (rs12874278 and rs17363566) in deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (&lt;i&gt;DLEU1)&lt;/i&gt; region associated with C19:0 level (P = 7.07×10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, when using a candidate-gene approach, we found evidence that three SNPs in &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; (rs11884924, rs16832067, and rs3816088) are associated with circulating C17:0 level (adjusted P = 4×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, nine SNPs in the ceramide synthase 4 (&lt;i&gt;CERS4)&lt;/i&gt; region were associated with circulating C23:0 levels (adjusted P&amp;lt;5×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that circulating levels of OCSFA may be predominantly influenced by non-genetic factors. SNPs associated with C17:0 level in the &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; gene may reflect genetic influence in dairy consumption or in metabolism of dairy foods. SNPs associated with C23:0 may reflect a role of genetic factors in the synthesis of sphingomyelin.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196951</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Genome-wide association meta-analysis of circulating odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids: Results from the CHARGE Consortium</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marcia C. de Oliveira Otto, Rozenn N.

SNPs associated with C23:0 may reflect a role of genetic factors in the synthesis of sphingomyelin.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Marcia C. de Oliveira Otto</name></author><fingerprint>19a6a2ea</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196951</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196951</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>I would like to report significant issues of concern regarding this paper (Savory et al., 2017).</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1525868563408</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16344da8bd0:ad04df:3dd877af</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35238</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525737600000</published><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35238</canonicalUrl><description>I would like to report significant issues of concern regarding this paper (Savory et al., 2017).</description><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Plant Biology</item></keywords><title>Comment on “Evolutionary transitions between beneficial and phytopathogenic Rhodococcus challenge disease management”</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>danny.vereecke@ugent.be (Danny Vereecke)</name></author><fingerprint>c87709f</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35238</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35238</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>81</engagement><crawled>1526579742221</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1636f3e460d:51f32:d63e3ae2</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003619</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hosni Cherif, François Duhamel, Bruno Cécyre, Alex Bouchard, Ariane Quintal, Sylvain Chemtob, Jean-François Bouchard&lt;/p&gt;
During the development of the visual system, high levels of energy are expended propelling axons from the retina to the brain. However, the role of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism in the development of the visual system has been overlooked. Here, we report that the carbohydrate metabolites succinate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and their respective receptor—GPR91 and GPR99—are involved in modulating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) projections toward the thalamus during visual system development. Using ex vivo and in vivo approaches, combined with pharmacological and genetic analyses, we revealed that GPR91 and GPR99 are expressed on axons of developing RGCs and have complementary roles during RGC axon growth in an extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;)-dependent manner. However, they have no effects on axon guidance. These findings suggest an important role for these receptors during the establishment of the visual system and provide a foundational link between carbohydrate metabolism and axon growth.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/N_QnsknNcYM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526590800000</published><fingerprint>84ce809</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003619</link><title>Receptors of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism, GPR91 and GPR99, mediate axon growth</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hosni Cherif, François Duhamel, Bruno Cécyre, Alex Bouchard, Ariane Quintal, Sylvain Chemtob, Jean-François Bouchard&lt;/p&gt;

This study investigated &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; expression in the &lt;i&gt;pars tuberalis&lt;/i&gt; (PT) of the pituitary and medio-basal hypothalamus (MBH) of sheep, across seasons and reproductive states. It has recently been proposed that season impacts alternative splicing of &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in the PT, which shifts the balance between angiogenic VEGFAxxx and anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms (with xxx the number of amino acids of the mature VEGFA proteins) to modulate seasonal breeding. Here, we used various RT-PCR methodologies and analysis of RNAseq datasets to investigate seasonal variation in expression and splicing of the ovine &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; gene. Collectively, we identify 5 different transcripts for &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; within the ewe PT/MBH, which correspond to splicing events previously described in mouse and human. All identified transcripts encode angiogenic VEGFAxxx isoforms, with no evidence for alternative splicing within exon 8. These findings led us to investigate in detail how “&lt;i&gt;Vegfaxxxb&lt;/i&gt;-like” PCR products could be generated by RT-PCR and misidentified as endogenous transcripts, in sheep and human HEK293 cells. In conclusion, our findings do not support the existence of anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms in the ovine PT/MBH and shed new light on the interpretation of prior studies, which claimed to identify &lt;i&gt;Vegfaxxxb&lt;/i&gt; isoforms by RT-PCR.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197123</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb transcripts are not expressed in the medio-basal hypothalamus of the seasonal sheep</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Didier Lomet, Benoît Piégu, Shona H.

In conclusion, our findings do not support the existence of anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms in the ovine PT/MBH and shed new light on the interpretation of prior studies, which claimed to identify &lt;i&gt;Vegfaxxxb&lt;/i&gt; isoforms by RT-PCR.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Didier Lomet</name></author><fingerprint>7ab7b568</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197123</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197123</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d099e:2835af05</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/977-g?rss=1</originId><published>1527788426000</published><fingerprint>2e9a096c</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/977-g?rss=1</link><title>Overcoming working memory limitations</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Stern, P.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/977.7.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/977-g?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1525771811096</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1633f163918:14b0b1:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04155-2</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracing the origin of heterogeneity and symmetry breaking in the early mammalian embryo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing the origin of heterogeneity and symmetry breaking in the early mammalian embryo, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04155-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04155-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What breaks symmetry in early mammalian embryonic development has been much questioned.

A universal turnaround has been detected in many countries of the World from shrinking to expanding forests. The forest area of western Europe expanded already in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Such early trends of forest resources cannot be associated with the rapid rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide nor with the anthropogenic climate change, which have taken place since the mid 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Modern, most recent spatial patterns of forest expansions and contractions do not correlate with the geography of climate trends nor with dry versus moist areas. Instead, the forest resources trends of nations correlate positively with UNDP Human Development Index. This indicates that forest resources of nations have improved along with progress in human well-being. Highly developed countries apply modern agricultural methods on good farmlands and abandon marginal lands, which become available for forest expansion. Developed countries invest in sustainable programs of forest management and nature protection. Our findings are significant for predicting the future of the terrestrial carbon sink. They suggest that the large sink of carbon recently observed in forests of the World will persist, if the well-being of people continues to improve. However, despite the positive trends in domestic forests, developed nations increasingly outsource their biomass needs abroad through international trade, and all nations rely on unsustainable energy use and wasteful patterns of material consumption.</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196248</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Forest resources of nations in relation to human well-being</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pekka E.

Bacterial blight (BB) in rice caused by &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas oryzae&lt;/i&gt; pv. &lt;i&gt;oryzae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Xoo&lt;/i&gt;) is a major global production constraint, particularly in irrigated and rain-fed lowland areas. Improved Samba Mahsuri (ISM) is an elite, high-yielding, fine-grain type, BB-resistant rice variety possessing three BB-resistant genes (&lt;i&gt;Xa21&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;xa13&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;xa5&lt;/i&gt;) and is highly popular in the southern parts of India. As the BB pathogen is highly dynamic and the evolution of pathogen virulence against the deployed resistance genes is common, we added a novel BB-resistant gene, &lt;i&gt;Xa38&lt;/i&gt;, into ISM through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) to increase the spectrum and durability of BB resistance. The breeding line PR 114 (Xa38) was used as the donor for &lt;i&gt;Xa38&lt;/i&gt;, whereas ISM was used as the recurrent parent. Foreground selection was conducted using PCR-based gene-specific markers for the target genes, whereas background selection was conducted using a set of polymorphic SSR markers between the parents and backcrossing that continued until the third generation. Eighteen homozygous BC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plants possessing all four BB-resistant genes in the homozygous state and with a recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery of more than 92% were identified and advanced to the BC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; generation. These 18 backcross-derived lines (BDLs) exhibited very high level of resistance against multiple &lt;i&gt;Xoo&lt;/i&gt; strains and displayed agro-morphological traits, grain qualities and yield levels similar to or better than those of the recurrent parent ISM.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198260</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Incorporation of the novel bacterial blight resistance gene &amp;lt;i&gt;Xa38&amp;lt;/i&gt; into the genetic background of elite rice variety Improved Samba Mahsuri</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arra Yugander, Raman M.

Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris (ARMD) is a major cause of implant failure leading to revision surgery in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties. However, the pathogenesis and its association to implant wear are poorly understood and previous studies have yielded discrepant results. We sought to investigate the associations between histological findings, whole blood and synovial fluid metal ion concentrations and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations in patients with MoM total hip replacements and hip resurfacings revised for ARMD. 107 hips in total were included in our study. Of these, 87 were total hip replacements and 20 were hip resurfacings, respectively. We found that whole blood, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations correlated poorly with histological findings. We suggest that the lack of a clear association between histological findings and wear measures in the present study as well as in previous studies is mostly influenced by variability in patient susceptibility. However, patients presenting with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration had lower chromium concentration in their periprosthetic tissues than patients with no perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. This may reflect the role of metal hypersensitivity in implant failure in these patients. Patients with total hip replacements evinced more necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration in their tissues than patients with hip resurfacings. This suggests that trunnion wear debris is more cytotoxic and/or immunogenic than bearing wear debris leading to higher failure rates seen in patients with total hip replacements.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197614</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Association between periprosthetic tissue metal content, whole blood and synovial fluid metal ion levels and histopathological findings in patients with failed metal-on-metal hip replacement</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lari Lehtovirta, Aleksi Reito, Jyrki Parkkinen, Sirpa Peräniemi, Jouko Vepsäläinen, Antti Eskelinen&lt;/p&gt;

However, patients presenting with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration had lower chromium concentration in their periprosthetic tissues than patients with no perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. This may reflect the role of metal hypersensitivity in implant failure in these patients. Patients with total hip replacements evinced more necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration in their tissues than patients with hip resurfacings. This suggests that trunnion wear debris is more cytotoxic and/or immunogenic than bearing wear debris leading to higher failure rates seen in patients with total hip replacements.</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Lari Lehtovirta</name></author><fingerprint>56e4495e</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197614</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197614</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01034/20180515/images/medium/jp-2018-01034b_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01034&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

A novel α-galactosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 36 was cloned from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus coagulans&lt;/i&gt;, overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and characterized. The purified enzyme Aga-BC7050 was 85 kDa according to SDS-PAGE and 168 kDa according to gel filtration, indicating that its native structure is a dimer. With &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl-α-d- galactopyranoside (pNPGal) as the substrate, optimal temperature and pH were 55 °C and 6.0, respectively. At 60 °C for 30 min, it retained &gt; 50% of its activity. It was stable at pH 5.0–10.0, and showed remarkable resistance to proteinase K, subtilisin A, α-chymotrypsin, and trypsin. Its activity was not inhibited by glucose, sucrose, xylose, or fructose, but was slightly inhibited at galactose concentrations up to 100 mM. Aga-BC7050 was highly active toward pNPGal, melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. It completely hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose in &amp;lt; 30 min.

Group B &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GBS) carriage by pregnant women is the primary risk factor for early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) can prevent this transmission route, and two main approaches are recommended to base the selection of pregnant women to be submitted to IAP: the risk-based and the culture-based strategies. In Brazil, compliance to such recommendations is poor, and not much is known about GBS carriage. In the present study, 3,647 pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were screened for GBS anogenital colonization, over a period of 8 years (2008–2015). GBS was detected in 956 (26.2%) of them, and presence of vaginal discharge was the only trait associated with a higher risk for GBS colonization. Serotypes Ia (257; 37.3%) and II (137; 19.9%) were the most frequent among 689 (72.1% of the total) GBS isolates evaluated, followed by NT isolates (84; 12.1%), serotype Ib (77; 11.1%), V (63; 9.1%), III (47; 6.8%) and IV (24; 3.5%). Estimated coverage of major serotype-based GBS vaccines currently under clinical trials would vary from 65.2% to 84.3%. All 689 isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, and tetracycline was observed in 5% (35), 2% (14), 14% (97), 5% (35) and 86% (592) of the isolates, respectively. No significant fluctuations in colonization rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were observed throughout the period of time investigated. The culture-based approach for IAP recommendation showed to be the best choice for the population investigated when compared to the risk-based, since the first did not increase the number of pregnant women submitted to antibiotic therapy and covered a larger number of women who were actually colonized by GBS. The fact the not all isolates were available for additional characterization, and serotype IX antiserum was not available for testing represent limitations of this study. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest investigation on GBS carriage among pregnant women in Brazil up to date, and results are useful for improving GBS prevention and treatment strategies.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196925</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Streptococcus agalactiae&amp;lt;/i&gt; carriage among pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, over a period of eight years</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Caroline N.

Goat breeding has become an important sector in Eastern Europe, with Romania and Hungary being among the major producer countries. Given the limited number of research done up-to-date concerning genetic studies of indigenous goat breeds reared in Romania and Hungary, the current preliminary study aimed to analyze the variability of genes related to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism by using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP™). We studied 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonging to 19 genes in indigenous breeds from both countries, namely Banat’s White (n = 36), Carpatina (n = 35) from Romania and Hungarian Milking (n = 79) and identified 16 polymorphic SNPs among 10 genes (&lt;i&gt;PTX3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLEC4E&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNFSF13&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TLR3&lt;/i&gt;) in 150 animals. Furthermore, the diversity of the studied breeds was investigated. The PIC values ranged from 0.042 to 0.691. The mean values of observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.235 and 0.246 respectively. The highest observed heterozygosity was obtained for &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T in Banat’s White (0.464), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T in Carpatina (0.577) and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G in Hungarian Milking (0.588). Pairwise F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values between the Romanian breeds and Romanian and Hungarian breeds were small (0.009 and 0.015), indicating the close relationship among the studied goat populations. From all the polymorphic SNPs identified, the Hungarian Milking breed showed the highest proportion of polymorphisms (100%), whereas the Carpatina breed had the lowest percentage (87.5%). The highest value of MAF was obtained for &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G (0.46), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T (0.47), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10344025C&gt;T (0.45), and &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T (0.42).

We uncovered atypical patterns of gene trap insertions that were not predicted to disrupt coding sequences, but caused changes in the expression of two key regulators of WNT signaling, suggesting the presence of cis-regulatory elements. Our methodology extends the scope of haploid genetic screens by enabling the identification of regulatory elements that control gene expression.</content></content><title>Discovery of gene regulatory elements through a new bioinformatics analysis of haploid genetic screens [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Patel, B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Asthma is the most common chronic disease during pregnancy and it may have influence on pregnancy outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our goal was to assess the association between maternal asthma and the perinatal risks as well as possible effects of asthma medication.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was based on a nationwide Finnish register-based cohort between the years 1996 and 2012 in the Drug and Pregnancy Database. The register data comprised 962 405 singleton live and stillbirths, 898 333 (93.3%) pregnancies in mothers with neither confirmed asthma nor use of asthma medication (controls), and 26 674 (2.8%) pregnancies with confirmed maternal asthma. 71% of mothers with asthma used asthma medication. The diagnosis of asthma was based on the mothers’ right for subsidised medication which is carefully evaluated by strict criteria including pulmonary function testing. Odds ratio was used in comparison. Premature birth (PB), low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), neonatal death were the main outcome measures.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Maternal asthma was associated with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for perinatal mortality 1.24 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.46), preterm birth 1.18 (1.11 to 1.25), low birth weight 1.29 (1.21 to 1.37), fetal growth restriction (SGA) 1.32, (1.24 to 1.40), and asphyxia 1.09 (1.02 to 1.17). Asthma treatment reduced the increased risk of preterm birth aOR 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) but mothers with treated asthma had higher risks of fetal growth restriction (SGA) aOR 1.26 (1.10 to 1.45), and asphyxia aOR 1.37 (1.17 to 1.61) than mothers with untreated asthma.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Asthma is associated with increased risks of perinatal mortality, preterm birth, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction (SGA), and asphyxia. Asthma treatment reduces the risk of preterm delivery, but it does not seem to reduce other complications such as perinatal mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197593</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Maternal asthma is associated with increased risk of perinatal mortality</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mari Kemppainen, Anna-Maria Lahesmaa-Korpinen, Paula Kauppi, Martti Virtanen, Suvi M.

A biophysical model that captures molecular homeostatic control of ions at the perisynaptic cradle (PsC) is of fundamental importance for understanding the interplay between astroglial and neuronal compartments. In this paper, we develop a multi-compartmental mathematical model which proposes a novel mechanism whereby the flow of cations in thin processes is restricted due to negatively charged membrane lipids which result in the formation of deep potential wells near the dipole heads. These wells restrict the flow of cations to “hopping” between adjacent wells as they transverse the process, and this surface retention of cations will be shown to give rise to the formation of potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) microdomains at the PsC. We further propose that a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomain formed at the PsC, provides the driving force for the return of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the extracellular space for uptake by the neurone, thereby preventing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; undershoot. A slow decay of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was also observed in our simulation after a period of glutamate stimulation which is in strong agreement with experimental observations. The pathological implications of microdomain formation during neuronal excitation are also discussed.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2aFUE1uepp4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526677200000</published><fingerprint>fc29cc46</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006151</link><title>Potassium and sodium microdomains in thin astroglial processes: A computational model study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin Breslin, John Joseph Wade, KongFatt Wong-Lin, Jim Harkin, Bronac Flanagan, Harm Van Zalinge, Steve Hall, Matthew Walker, Alexei Verkhratsky, Liam McDaid&lt;/p&gt;

Combining our model with virtual high-throughput screening techniques, we evaluated the coiling behavior of hundreds of new polymers. Using the screening results, we established correlations between the structure of the side chain and the coil dimensions of polymers.The supplementary material accompanying this paper includes the library of 275 polymers and their corresponding Ks values.</description><published>1528156800000</published><unread>True</unread><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Effect_of_Tacticity_and_Side_Chain_Structure_on_the_Coil_Dimensions_of_Polyolefins/6406886</link><title>The Effect of Tacticity and Side Chain Structure on the Coil Dimensions of Polyolefins</title><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><fingerprint>657ea91f</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Effect_of_Tacticity_and_Side_Chain_Structure_on_the_Coil_Dimensions_of_Polyolefins/6406886</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527620470952</crawled><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_163ad4688a8:21a1183:2835af05</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5250.short?rss=1</originId><description>CORE CONCEPTS Correction for “Core Concept: Microgrids offer flexible energy generation, for a price,” by Gayathri Vaidyanathan, which was first published April 24, 2018; 10.1073/pnas.1804507115 (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 115:4298–4300).

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a zinc-dependent protease associated with early immune responses to &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection, macrophage recruitment and granuloma formation. We evaluated whether adjunctive inhibition of MMP-9 could improve the response to standard TB treatment in a mouse model that develops necrotic lesions. Six weeks after an aerosol infection with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, C3HeB/FeJ mice received standard TB treatment (12 weeks) comprising rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide alone or in combination with either anti-MMP-9 antibody, etanercept (positive control) or isotype antibody (negative control) for 6 weeks. Anti-MMP-9 and the isotype control had comparable high serum exposures and expected terminal half-life. The relapse rate in mice receiving standard TB treatment was 46.6%. Compared to the standard TB treatment, relapse rates in animals that received adjunctive treatments with anti-MMP-9 antibody or etanercept were significantly decreased to 25.9% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) and 29.8% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019) respectively, but were not different from the arm that received the isotype control antibody (25.9%). Immunostaining demonstrated localization of MMP-9 primarily in macrophages in both murine and human lung tissues infected with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting the importance of MMP-9 in TB pathogenesis. These data suggest that the relapse rates in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice may be non-specifically improved by administration of antibodies in conjunction with standard TB treatments.

Here we suggest an alternative method using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to generate a flexible family of models that have sufficient capacity to represent the complex learning and decision-making strategies used by humans. In this approach, an RNN is trained to predict the next action that a subject will take in a decision-making task and, in this way, learns to imitate the processes underlying subjects&apos; choices and their learning abilities. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach using a new dataset drawn from patients with either unipolar (n=34) or bipolar (n=33) depression and matched healthy controls (n=34) making decisions on a two-armed bandit task. The results indicate that this new approach is better than baseline reinforcement-learning methods in terms of overall performance and its capacity to predict subjects&apos; choices. We show that the model can be interpreted using off-policy simulations and thereby provides a novel clustering of subjects&apos; learning processes -- something that often eludes traditional approaches to modelling and behavioural analysis.</description><published>1526626800000</published><fingerprint>4b379d52</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/285221v2?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Popular computational models of decision-making make specific assumptions about learning processes that may cause them to underfit observed behaviours.

We show that the model can be interpreted using off-policy simulations and thereby provides a novel clustering of subjects&apos; learning processes -- something that often eludes traditional approaches to modelling and behavioural analysis.</content></content><title>Models that learn how humans learn: the case of decision-making and its disorders [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Dezfouli, A.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/18/285221</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/285221v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1526887776990</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163819a82de:61571e2:3dd877af</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5016284?af=R</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526620920000</published><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5016284?af=R</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/19&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 19&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Generalized Breit-Wigner treatment of molecular transport: Charging effects in a single decanedithiol molecule</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Hugo Andres Cabrera-Tinoco</name></author><fingerprint>5b74067f</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5016284?af=R</href></item></alternate></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Catechol-O-Methyltransferase is an enzyme which catalyzes the methylation reaction of dopamine by S-Adenosylmethionine increasing the reaction rate by almost 16 orders of magnitude compared to the reaction in aqueous solution.

Retention in care remains an important issue for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs according to WHO guidelines, formerly called the “Option B+” approach. The objective of this study was to examine how poverty, gender, and health system factors interact to influence women’s participation in PMTCT services. We used qualitative research, literature, and hypothesized variable connections to diagram causes and effects in causal loop models. We found that many factors, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, service design and quality, stigma, disclosure, spouse/partner influence, decision-making autonomy, and knowledge about PMTCT, influence psychosocial health, which in turn affects women’s participation in PMTCT services. Thus, interventions to improve psychosocial health need to address many factors to be successful. We also found that the design of PMTCT services, a modifiable factor, is important because it affects several other factors. We identified 66 feedback loops that may contribute to policy resistance—that is, a policy’s failure to have its intended effect. Our findings point to the need for a multipronged intervention to encourage women’s continued participation in PMTCT services and for longitudinal research to quantify and test our causal loop model.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197239</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Interactions among poverty, gender, and health systems affect women’s participation in services to prevent HIV transmission from mother to child: A causal loop analysis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Yourkavitch, Kristen Hassmiller Lich, Valerie L.

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape. We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Functional clustering of mouse ultrasonic vocalization data</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoling Dou, Shingo Shirahata, Hiroki Sugimoto&lt;/p&gt;

We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Xiaoling Dou</name></author><fingerprint>b9423df6</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1525709458882</crawled><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_1633b5ecdc2:29a635c:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4149</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unleashing biotech&apos;s crouching tiger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unleashing biotech&apos;s crouching tiger, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4149&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4149&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;With a massive expansion in healthcare coverage, biotech&apos;s next big boom could occur in India.

Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo) in the rat is a widely used animal model of vascular dementia and a valuable tool for preclinical pharmacological drug testing, although the varying degrees of acute focal ischemic lesions it induces could interfere with its translational value. Recently, a modification to the BCCAo model, the stepwise occlusion of the two carotid arteries, has been introduced. To acquire objective translatable measures, we used longitudinal multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the effects of semi-chronic (8 days) donepezil treatment in this model, with half of the Wistar rats receiving the treatment one week after the stepwise BCCAo. With an ultrahigh field MRI, we measured high-resolution anatomy, diffusion tensor imaging, cerebral blood flow measurements and functional MRI in response to whisker stimulation, to evaluate both the structural and functional effects of the donepezil treatment and stepwise BCCAo up to 5 weeks post-occlusion. While no large ischemic lesions were detected, atrophy in the striatum and in the neocortex, along with widespread white matter microstructural changes, were found. Donepezil ameliorated the transient drop in the somatosensory BOLD response in distant cortical areas, as detected 2 weeks after the occlusion but the drug had no effect on the long term structural changes. Our results demonstrate a measurable functional MRI effect of the donepezil treatment and the importance of diffusion MRI and voxel based morphometry (VBM) analysis in the translational evaluation of the rat BCCAo model.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198265</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Stepwise occlusion of the carotid arteries of the rat: MRI assessment of the effect of donepezil and hypoperfusion-induced brain atrophy and white matter microstructural changes</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriella Nyitrai, Tamás Spisák, Zsófia Spisák, Dávid Gajári, Pálma Diószegi, Tamás Zsigmond Kincses, András Czurkó&lt;/p&gt;

Six fungal-type cellulose binding domains were found in the genome of the coccolithophore &lt;i&gt;Emiliania huxleyi&lt;/i&gt; and cloned and expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. Sequence comparison indicate high similarity to fungal cellulose binding domains, raising the question of why these domains exist in coccolithophores. The proteins were tested for binding with cellulose and chitin as ligands, which resulted in the identification of two functional carbohydrate binding modules: EHUX2 and EHUX4. Compared to benchmark fungal cellulose binding domain Cel7A-CBM1 from &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma reesei&lt;/i&gt;, these proteins showed slightly lower binding to birch and bacterial cellulose, but were more efficient chitin binders. Finally, a set of cellulose binding domains was created based on the shuffling of one well-functioning and one non-functional domain. These were characterized in order to get more information of the binding domain’s sequence–function relationship, indicating characteristic differences between the molecular basis of cellulose versus chitin recognition. As previous reports have showed the presence of cellulose in coccoliths and here we find functional cellulose binding modules, a possible connection is discussed.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197875</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Fungal-type carbohydrate binding modules from the coccolithophore &amp;lt;i&gt;Emiliania huxleyi&amp;lt;/i&gt; show binding affinity to cellulose and chitin</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bart J.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX) and Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) are used as formative assessments worldwide. Since an up-to-date comprehensive synthesis of the educational impact of Mini-CEX and DOPS is lacking, we performed a systematic review. Moreover, as the educational impact might be influenced by characteristics of the setting in which Mini-CEX and DOPS take place or their implementation status, we additionally investigated these potential influences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We searched Scopus, Web of Science, and Ovid, including All Ovid Journals, Embase, ERIC, Ovid MEDLINE(R), and PsycINFO, for original research articles investigating the educational impact of Mini-CEX and DOPS on undergraduate and postgraduate trainees from all health professions, published in English or German from 1995 to 2016. Educational impact was operationalized and classified using Barr’s adaptation of Kirkpatrick’s four-level model. Where applicable, outcomes were pooled in meta-analyses, separately for Mini-CEX and DOPS. To examine potential influences, we used Fisher’s exact test for count data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified 26 articles demonstrating heterogeneous effects of Mini-CEX and DOPS on learners’ reactions (Kirkpatrick Level 1) and positive effects of Mini-CEX and DOPS on trainees’ performance (Kirkpatrick Level 2b; Mini-CEX: &lt;i&gt;standardized mean difference (SMD)&lt;/i&gt; = 0.26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.014; DOPS: &lt;i&gt;SMD&lt;/i&gt; = 3.33, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).

Since development of plasmid gene therapy for therapeutic angiogenesis by J. Isner this approach was an attractive option for ischemic diseases affecting large cohorts of patients. However, first placebo-controlled clinical trials showed its limited efficacy questioning further advance to practice. Thus, combined methods using delivery of several angiogenic factors got into spotlight as a way to improve outcomes. This study provides experimental proof of concept for a combined approach using simultaneous delivery of VEGF165 and HGF genes to alleviate consequences of myocardial infarction (MI). However, recent studies suggested that angiogenic growth factors have pleiotropic effects that may contribute to outcome so we expanded focus of our work to investigate potential mechanisms underlying action of VEGF165, HGF and their combination in MI. Briefly, Wistar rats underwent coronary artery ligation followed by injection of plasmid bearing VEGF165 or HGF or mixture of these. Histological assessment showed decreased size of post-MI fibrosis in both—VEGF165- or HGF-treated animals yet most prominent reduction of collagen deposition was observed in VEGF165+HGF group. Combined delivery group rats were the only to show significant increase of left ventricle (LV) wall thickness. We also found dilatation index improved in HGF or VEGF165+HGF treated animals. These effects were partially supported by our findings of c-kit+ cardiac stem cell number increase in all treated animals compared to negative control. Sporadic Ki-67+ mature cardiomyocytes were found in peri-infarct area throughout study groups with comparable effects of VEGF165, HGF and their combination. Assessment of vascular density in peri-infarct area showed efficacy of both–VEGF165 and HGF while combination of growth factors showed maximum increase of CD31+ capillary density. To our surprise arteriogenic response was limited in HGF-treated animals while VEGF165 showed potent positive influence on a-SMA+ blood vessel density. The latter hinted to evaluate infiltration of monocytes as they are known to modulate arteriogenic response in myocardium. We found that monocyte infiltration was driven by VEGF165 and reduced by HGF resulting in alleviation of VEGF-stimulated monocyte taxis after combined delivery of these 2 factors. Changes of monocyte infiltration were concordant with a-SMA+ arteriole density so we tested influence of VEGF165 or HGF on endothelial cells (EC) that mediate angiogenesis and inflammatory response. In a series of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments we found that VEGF165 and HGF regulate production of inflammatory chemokines by human EC. In particular MCP-1 levels changed after treatment by recombinant VEGF, HGF or their combination and were concordant with NF-κB activation and monocyte infiltration in corresponding groups &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We also found that both–VEGF165 and HGF upregulated IL-8 production by EC while their combination showed additive type of response reaching peak values. These changes were HIF-2 dependent and siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-2α abolished effects of VEGF165 and HGF on IL-8 production. To conclude, our study supports combined gene therapy by VEGF165 and HGF to treat MI and highlights neglected role of pleiotropic effects of angiogenic growth factors that may define efficacy via regulation of inflammatory response and endothelial function.</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197566</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Angiogenic and pleiotropic effects of VEGF165 and HGF combined gene therapy in a rat model of myocardial infarction</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pavel I.

Histological assessment showed decreased size of post-MI fibrosis in both—VEGF165- or HGF-treated animals yet most prominent reduction of collagen deposition was observed in VEGF165+HGF group. Combined delivery group rats were the only to show significant increase of left ventricle (LV) wall thickness. We also found dilatation index improved in HGF or VEGF165+HGF treated animals. These effects were partially supported by our findings of c-kit+ cardiac stem cell number increase in all treated animals compared to negative control. Sporadic Ki-67+ mature cardiomyocytes were found in peri-infarct area throughout study groups with comparable effects of VEGF165, HGF and their combination. Assessment of vascular density in peri-infarct area showed efficacy of both–VEGF165 and HGF while combination of growth factors showed maximum increase of CD31+ capillary density. To our surprise arteriogenic response was limited in HGF-treated animals while VEGF165 showed potent positive influence on a-SMA+ blood vessel density. The latter hinted to evaluate infiltration of monocytes as they are known to modulate arteriogenic response in myocardium. We found that monocyte infiltration was driven by VEGF165 and reduced by HGF resulting in alleviation of VEGF-stimulated monocyte taxis after combined delivery of these 2 factors. Changes of monocyte infiltration were concordant with a-SMA+ arteriole density so we tested influence of VEGF165 or HGF on endothelial cells (EC) that mediate angiogenesis and inflammatory response. In a series of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments we found that VEGF165 and HGF regulate production of inflammatory chemokines by human EC. In particular MCP-1 levels changed after treatment by recombinant VEGF, HGF or their combination and were concordant with NF-κB activation and monocyte infiltration in corresponding groups &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We also found that both–VEGF165 and HGF upregulated IL-8 production by EC while their combination showed additive type of response reaching peak values. These changes were HIF-2 dependent and siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-2α abolished effects of VEGF165 and HGF on IL-8 production. To conclude, our study supports combined gene therapy by VEGF165 and HGF to treat MI and highlights neglected role of pleiotropic effects of angiogenic growth factors that may define efficacy via regulation of inflammatory response and endothelial function.</content></content><updated>1527022800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Pavel I.

Applying Crunch to 128 ChIP-seq datasets from the ENCODE project we find that TFs naturally separate into `solitary TFs&apos;, for which a single motif explains the ChIP-peaks, and `co-binding TFs&apos; for which multiple motifs co-occur within peaks. Moreover, for most datasets the motifs that Crunch identified de novo outperform known motifs and both the set of co-binding motifs and the top motif of solitary TFs are consistent across experiments and cell lines.

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of phosphorus (P) restriction on the deleterious effects of high fat diets on mineral metabolism. Twenty-four rats were allotted to 3 groups (n = 8 each) that were fed different diets for 7 months. Rats in group 1 were fed normal fat-normal P (0.6%) diet (NF-NP), rats in group 2 were fed high fat- normal P diet (HF-NP) and rats in group 3 were fed high fat-low P (0.2%) diet (HF-LP). Blood, urine and tissues were collected at the end of the experiments. When compared with the control group (NF-NP), rats fed HF diets showed increases in body weight, and in plasma concentrations of triglycerides and leptin, and decreased plasma calcitriol concentrations. In rats fed HF-NP plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) was higher (279.6±39.4 pg/ml vs 160.6±25.0 pg/ml, p = 0.018) and renal klotho (ratio klotho/GAPDH) was lower (0.75±0.06 vs 1.06±0.08, p&amp;lt;0.01) than in rats fed NF-NP. Phosphorus restriction did not normalize plasma FGF23 or renal klotho; in fact, rats fed HF-LP, that only ingested an average of 22.9 mg/day of P, had higher FGF23 (214.7±32.4 pg/ml) concentrations than rats fed NF-NP (160.6±25.0 pg/ml), that ingested and average of 74.4 mg/day of P over a 7 month period. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that severe P restriction over a prolonged period of time (7 months) does not normalize the increase in circulating FGF23 induced by HF diets. These data indicate that the deleterious effects of high fat diet on the FGF23/klotho axis are not eliminated by reduced P intake.</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198481</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Phosphorus restriction does not prevent the increase in fibroblast growth factor 23 elicited by high fat diet</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael Rios, Carmen Pineda, Ignacio Lopez, Juan Muñoz-Castañeda, Mariano Rodriguez, Escolastico Aguilera-Tejero, Ana I.

The aim of this study was to examine eye movements and postural control performance among dyslexic children while reading a text and performing the Landolt reading task. Fifteen dyslexic and 15 non-dyslexic children were asked to stand upright while performing two experimental visual tasks: text reading and Landolt reading. In the text reading task, children were asked to silently read a text displayed on a monitor, while in the Landolt reading task, the letters in the text were replaced by closed circles and Landolt rings, and children were asked to scan each circle/ring in a reading-like fashion, from left to right, and to count the number of Landolt rings. Eye movements (Mobile T2&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, SuriCog) and center of pressure excursions (Framiral&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, Grasse, France) were recorded. Visual performance variables were total reading time, mean duration of fixation, number of pro- and retro-saccades, and amplitude of pro-saccades. Postural performance variable was the center of pressure area. The results showed that dyslexic children spent more time reading the text and had a longer duration of fixation than non-dyslexic children. However, no difference was observed between dyslexic and non-dyslexic children in the Landolt reading task. Dyslexic children performed a higher number of pro- and retro-saccades than non-dyslexic children in both text reading and Landolt reading tasks. Dyslexic children had smaller pro-saccade amplitude than non-dyslexic children in the text reading task. Finally, postural performance was poorer in dyslexic children than in non-dyslexic children. Reading difficulties in dyslexic children are related to eye movement strategies required to scan and obtain lexical and semantic meaning. However, postural control performance, which was poor in dyslexic children, is not related to lexical and semantic reading requirements and might not also be related to different eye movement behavior.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198001</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Eye movements and postural control in dyslexic children performing different visual tasks</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Milena Razuk, José Angelo Barela, Hugo Peyre, Christophe Loic Gerard, Maria Pia Bucci&lt;/p&gt;

Production of the iron regulatory peptide hepcidin is tightly controlled by a network of proteins in hepatocytes that sense levels of iron in the circulation (as diferric-transferrin) and in tissues (in ferritin). Human studies show high variability in the normal range of serum hepcidin levels. We have postulated that this may, in part, be related to inter-individual variability in the expression of genes in the iron sensing pathway, potentially governed by epigenetic factors. Here, we have investigated whether genes encoding hepatic iron sensing proteins and hepcidin are regulated by DNA methylation. Experiments were performed on two human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells. Basal expression of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in Huh7 cells compared with HepG2 cells. Analysis of bisulphite-converted DNA from Huh7 cells revealed partial methylation of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; (alpha transcript), which could result in gene silencing. Demethylation using 5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine (AZA) increased &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7. PCR analysis of bisulphite-converted &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; promoter DNA, using methylation-specific primers, revealed no differences between cell lines. However, &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7 was increased by AZA treatment, suggesting that methylation of one or more iron sensing genes may indirectly influence &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; expression. Our study provides evidence that DNA methylation might control expression of &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; and other hepatic iron sensing genes, and indicates that epigenetic influences on iron homeostasis warrant further investigation.</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197863</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>DNA methylation of hepatic iron sensing genes and the regulation of hepcidin expression</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paul A.

To examine the 20-year trends in the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity among children aged 0–6 years between 1995 and 2015 in Harbin, China, we selected altogether 49,553 children aged 0–6 years old by using a multistage stratified cluster sampling methods in Harbin, one provincial capital city in northeast China in 1995, 2005 and 2015. Height and weight information of the children were collected. We used the child growth standards of World Health Organization to calculate the Z-scores for body mass index (BMI). Cut-offs recommended by World Health Organization and International Obesity Task Force were used to define overweight and obesity for each children. We found there is no difference between boys’ BMI and girls’ among newborns in each survey point (p&gt;0.05), but in older age groups, the BMI of boys was higher than that of girls (p&amp;lt;0.05). From 1995 to 2015, the average BMI was increasing continuously among boys older than 42 months and girls older than 48 months (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for linear trend across year) in Harbin. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 2.6% in 1995 to 7.6% in 2015. For every 10-year the risk of combined overweight and obesity in children aged 0–6 years increased by 167% (95%CI: 146%, 188%, p&amp;lt;0.01). The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in most age subgroups showed an increasing trend over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for trend test across survey year). The age when the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity dramatically increased was earlier in 2015 than that in 2005 and 1995. In conclusion, there was an increasing trend of the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity during the past 20 years in Harbin and the age when the prevalence dramatically increased became earlier. Comprehensive intervention should be undertaken among younger children to prevent and control children’s overweight and obesity.</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198032</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>20-year trends in prevalence of overweight and obesity among children aged 0-6 in Harbin, China: A multiple cross-sectional study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Liu, Qin Li, Hui Li, Jia Li, Hai-Jun Wang, Bin Li&lt;/p&gt;

The Poisson channel is an important communication model for such noisy interactions, providing a fundamental link between timing precision, information transfer and the rate of signalling. Constraints on this rate limit the Poisson channel capacity, which in turn bounds the precision with which molecular networks can solve estimation problems. We investigate these bounds as a function of signalling rate constraints, for problems in which information about a target molecular species, to be estimated, is encoded in the birth rate of a signalling species. Birth-following is a known heuristic encoder that asserts the maximum signalling rate until every target birth is recorded, then deactivates. Here we derive birth-following as a minimum time signalling (bang-bang) code, and prove that it outperforms these precision bounds for general target birth rate functions over arbitrary signalling network architectures. The simplest of these networks commonly models the dynamics of long-lived proteins. Birth-following is therefore an important reference strategy when the maximum signalling rate is high and the mean rate is no smaller than that of the target molecule.

The Poisson channel is an important communication model for such noisy interactions, providing a fundamental link between timing precision, information transfer and the rate of signalling. Constraints on this rate limit the Poisson channel capacity, which in turn bounds the precision with which molecular networks can solve estimation problems. We investigate these bounds as a function of signalling rate constraints, for problems in which information about a target molecular species, to be estimated, is encoded in the birth rate of a signalling species. Birth-following is a known heuristic encoder that asserts the maximum signalling rate until every target birth is recorded, then deactivates. Here we derive birth-following as a minimum time signalling (bang-bang) code, and prove that it outperforms these precision bounds for general target birth rate functions over arbitrary signalling network architectures. The simplest of these networks commonly models the dynamics of long-lived proteins. Birth-following is therefore an important reference strategy when the maximum signalling rate is high and the mean rate is no smaller than that of the target molecule. Discreteness is important in this regime. We examine the limit of this regime by removing the maximum signalling constraint. This leads to a Poisson channel with infinite capacity, which should allow completely precise timing. However, we find perfect estimation unrealisable unless the mean condition is maintained. The relationship between estimation and information is therefore not as simple or intuitive as in analogous problems on Gaussian channels. Higher Poisson capacities do not always imply better precision and realisable performance is more dependent on finding suitable encoders that capitalise on the information structure of the signalling problem of interest. There is a need for new information-theoretic metrics that can better account for both the gap between achievable and theoretical precision, and the idiosyncrasies of the Poisson channel.</content></content><title>On the Biological Signalling, Information and Estimation Limits of Birth Processes [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Parag, K.

As the production of non-traditional export (NTX) crops by smallholder households in developing countries expands, there is a compelling need to understand the potential effects of this type of agricultural production on household food security and nutrition. We use two household surveys with a sample of 52 households, interviews, and focus groups to examine whether smallholder farmers who produce broccoli for export in a rural Guatemalan community have different household food security than farmers in the same community who are still growing traditional maize and bean crops. We explore and compare the food security status of broccoli farmers (adopters) and traditional farmers (non-adopters) across four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability. Adopters earned significantly more income (40%) than non-adopters, but higher incomes did not coincide with improvements in food availability, food access, or food utilization. Results indicate that adopters and non-adopters alike struggle with access to food, while the intensity of broccoli production may be undermining the ability of local agricultural systems to naturally control pests and regulate nutrients. More systematic approaches to food security assessment, especially those that consider all four dimensions of food security, are needed to better target interventions designed to alleviate food insecurity among rural smallholders.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198113</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Reconsidering non-traditional export agriculture and household food security: A case study in rural Guatemala</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Josée Méthot, Elena M.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the most common of the human porphyrias, arises from a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Studies have shown a high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with PCT. While these observations implicate HCV infection as a risk factor for PCT pathogenesis, the mechanism of interaction between the virus and porphyrin metabolism is unknown. This study aimed to assess the effect of HCV core protein on intracellular porphyrin metabolism to elucidate the link between HCV infection and PCT. The accumulation and excretion of porphyrins after treatment with 5-aminolevulinic acid, a porphyrin precursor, were compared between cells stably expressing HCV core protein and controls. Cells expressing HCV core protein had lower amounts of intracellular protoporphyrin IX and heme and had higher amounts of excreted coproporphyrin III, the oxidized form of coproporphyrinogen III, compared with controls. These observations suggest that HCV core protein affects porphyrin metabolism and facilitates the export of excess coproporphyrinogen III and/or coproporphyrin III, possibly via porphyrin transporters. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the presence of HCV core protein increased the mRNA expression of porphyrin exporters ABCG2 and FLVCR1. Western blot analysis showed a higher expression level of FLVCR1, but not ABCG2, as well as a higher expression level of mature ALAS1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway, in HCV core protein-expressing cells compared with controls. The data indicate that HCV core protein induced abnormal intracellular porphyrin metabolism, with an over-excretion of coproporphyrin III. These findings may partially account for the susceptibility of HCV-infected individuals to PCT development.</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198345</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Hepatitis C virus core protein triggers abnormal porphyrin metabolism in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takafumi Nakano, Kyoji Moriya, Kazuhiko Koike, Toshiharu Horie&lt;/p&gt;

Capabilities of RAVEN 2.0 were demonstrated through de novo reconstruction of GEMs for the antibiotic-producing bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. Comparison of the automated de novo reconstruction with iMK1208, a previously published high-quality S. coelicolor GEM, demonstrated that RAVEN 2.0 captures most of the manually curated model. The generated de novo reconstruction was subsequently used to curate iMK1208 resulting in Sco4, the most comprehensive GEM of S. coelicolor, with increased coverage of both primary and secondary metabolism. This increased coverage allowed the use of Sco4 to predict novel genome editing targets for optimized secondary metabolites production. As such, we demonstrate how RAVEN 2.0 can not only be used for de novo GEM reconstruction, but also for curating existing models based on up-to-date databases.

Both RAVEN 2.0 and Sco4 are deposited on GitHub to facilitate usage and further development by the community.</content></content><title>RAVEN 2.0: a versatile platform for metabolic network reconstruction and a case study on Streptomyces coelicolor [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Wang, H.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/13/321067</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321067v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1526270827971</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1635cd49dc3:2d68bc3:2835af05</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/320861v1?rss=1</originId><description>The Gene Ontology (GO) is one of the most widely used resources in molecular and cellular biology, largely through the use of &amp;quot;enrichment analysis&amp;quot;.

We compared the results that would have been obtained around the time of publication to those obtained for a current edition of GO/GOA, calibrated using a null based on randomly paired hit lists. Overall, 53% of hit lists were considered to yield significantly stable enrichment results, despite 90% of them being more than 9.2 years old. Because stability is far from assured for any individual hit list, GOTrack can lead to more informed and cautious application of GO to genomics research.</description><published>1526194800000</published><fingerprint>e6097e68</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/320861v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Gene Ontology (GO) is one of the most widely used resources in molecular and cellular biology, largely through the use of &amp;quot;enrichment analysis&amp;quot;.

Advanced graphics capabilities have enabled the use of virtual reality as an efficient design technique. The integration of virtual reality in the design phase still faces impediment because of issues linked to the integration of CAD and virtual reality software. A set of empirical tests using the selected conversion parameters was found to yield properly represented virtual reality models. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 72.71% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 86.64%, indicating that 86.64% of the response variability can be explained by the model. The R-sq (pred) is 67.45%, which is not very high, indicating that the model should be further reduced by eliminating insignificant terms. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 73.32% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 79.49%, indicating that 79.49% of the response variability can be explained by the model. Using the optimization software MODE Frontier (Optimization, MOGA-II, 2014), four types of response surfaces for the three considered response variables were tested for the data of DOE.

Background &lt;p&gt;The discussion on the use of bevacizumab is still ongoing and often doctors are deterred from using bevacizumab due to legal or political issues. Bevacizumab is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), albeit unregistered for the disease. Therefore, in some countries ophthalmologists use the equally effective but expensive drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept. We describe the economic consequences of this dilemma surrounding AMD treatment from a societal perspective.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We modelled cost-effectiveness of treatment with ranibizumab (as-needed), aflibercept (bimonthly) and bevacizumab (as-needed). Effectiveness was estimated by systematic review and meta-analysis. The drug with the most favourable cost-effectiveness profile compared to bevacizumab was used for threshold analyses. First, we determined how much we overspend per injection. Second, we calculated the required effectiveness to justify the current price and the reasonable price for a drug leading to optimal vision. Finally, we estimated how much Europe overspends if bevacizumab is not first choice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab treatment costs €27,087 per year, about €4,000 less than aflibercept and €6,000 less than ranibizumab. With similar effectiveness for all drugs as shown by meta-analysis, bevacizumab was the most cost-effective. Aflibercept was chosen for threshold analyses. Aflibercept costs €943 per injection, but we determined that the maximum price to be cost-effective is €533. Alternatively, at its current price, aflibercept should yield about twice the visual gain. Even when optimal vision can be achieved, the maximum price for any treatment is €37,453 per year. Most importantly, Europe overspends €335 million yearly on AMD treatment when choosing aflibercept over bevacizumab.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab is the most cost-effective treatment for AMD, yet is not the standard of care across Europe. The registered drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept lead to large overspending without additional health benefits. Health authorities should consider taking steps to implement bevacizumab into clinical practice as first choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197670</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration—A cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Freekje van Asten, Charlotte T.

The results suggest massive AS regulation in the brain that is also likely important for circadian regulation.</description><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><title>Striking circadian neuron diversity and cycling of Drosophila alternative splicing</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>katea@brandeis.edu (Donald C Rio)</name></author><fingerprint>3412a6e6</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35618</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35618</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>18</engagement><crawled>1527798117127</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163b7dd3307:321f9cf:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05322-7</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthetic nerve flexes a cockroach’s muscle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthetic nerve flexes a cockroach’s muscle, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05322-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05322-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Electronic system recreates an advanced sense of touch.</description><published>1527750000000</published><engagementRate>0.18</engagementRate><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05322-7</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthetic nerve flexes a cockroach’s muscle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthetic nerve flexes a cockroach’s muscle, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05322-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05322-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Electronic system recreates an advanced sense of touch.</content></content><title>Synthetic nerve flexes a cockroach’s muscle</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05322-7/d41586-018-05322-7_15805006.jpg</url><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><fingerprint>2bee81a0</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05322-7</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1525793301200</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163405e22d0:39eb7a:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05069-1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 years ago&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 &amp;amp;amp; 100 years ago, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05069-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05069-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 years ago</description><published>1525762800000</published><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05069-1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 years ago&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 &amp;amp;amp; 100 years ago, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05069-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05069-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 years ago</content></content><title>50 &amp; 100 years ago</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><fingerprint>50b119a6</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05069-1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219e:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197254</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Estrella Rubio-Solsona, Salvador Martí, Juan J.

Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (&lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been widely related to neuropsychiatry disorders. The localization of ANKK1 in neural progenitors and its correlation with the cell cycle has suggested its participation in development. However, ANKK1 functions still need to be identified. Here, we have further characterized the ANKK1 localization &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, by using immunolabeling, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in the myogenic lineage. Histologic investigations in mice and humans revealed that ANKK1 is expressed in precursors of embryonic and adult muscles. In mice embryos, ANKK1 was found in migrating myotubes where it shows a polarized cytoplasmic distribution, while proliferative myoblasts and satellite cells show different isoforms in their nuclei and cytoplasm. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of ANKK1 protein isoforms along the myogenic progression showed the decline of nuclear ANKK1-kinase until its total exclusion in myotubes. In adult mice, ANKK1 was expressed exclusively in the Fast-Twitch muscles fibers subtype. The induction of glycolytic metabolism in C2C12 cells with high glucose concentration or treatment with berberine caused a significant increase in the &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Similarly, C2C12 cells under hypoxic conditions caused the increase of nuclear ANKK1. These results altogether show a relationship between &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation and the metabolism of muscles during development and in adulthood. Finally, we found ANKK1 expression in regenerative fibers of muscles from dystrophic patients. Future studies in ANKK1 biology and the pathological response of muscles will reveal whether this protein is a novel muscle disease biomarker.</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197254</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>ANKK1 is found in myogenic precursors and muscle fibers subtypes with glycolytic metabolism</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Estrella Rubio-Solsona, Salvador Martí, Juan J.

Treatment of prosthetic joint infections often involves multiple surgeries and prolonged antibiotic administration, resulting in a significant burden to patients and the healthcare system. We are exploring a non-invasive method to eradicate biofilm on metal implants utilizing high-frequency alternating magnetic fields (AMF) which can achieve surface induction heating. Although proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the ability of AMF to eradicate biofilm in vitro, there is a legitimate safety concern related to the potential for thermal damage to surrounding tissues when considering heating implanted metal objects. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting acoustic emissions associated with boiling at the interface between a metal implant and surrounding soft tissue as a wireless safety sensing mechanism. Acoustic emissions generated during in vitro and in vivo AMF exposures were captured with a hydrophone, and the relationship with surface temperature analyzed. The effect of AMF exposure power, surrounding media composition, implant location within the AMF transmitter, and implant geometry on acoustic detection during AMF therapy was also evaluated. Acoustic emissions were reliably identified in both tissue-mimicking phantom and mouse studies, and their onset coincided with the implant temperature reaching the boiling threshold. The viscosity of the surrounding medium did not impact the production of acoustic emissions; however, emissions were not present when the medium was oil due to the higher boiling point. Results of simulations and in vivo studies suggest that short-duration, high-power AMF exposures combined with acoustic sensing can be used to minimize the amount of thermal damage in surrounding tissues. These studies support the hypothesis that detection of boiling associated acoustic emissions at a metal/tissue interface could serve as a real-time, wireless safety indicator during AMF treatment of biofilm on metallic implants.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197380</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Remote acoustic sensing as a safety mechanism during exposure of metal implants to alternating magnetic fields</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bingbing Cheng, Yonatan Chatzinoff, Debby Szczepanski, Chenchen Bing, Sumbul Shaikh, Omar Wyman, Cameron E.

Further, our calculated UV‐vis absorbance and fluorescence spectra are in accordance with the experimental measurements. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><published>1526094326000</published><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25341?af=R</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Fluoride anion sensing mechanism of a BODIPY‐linked hydrogen‐bonding probe</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><author><name>YangLi

Active learning is a pedagogical approach that involves students engaging in collaborative learning, which enables them to take more responsibility for their learning and improve their critical thinking skills. While prior research examined student performance at majority universities, this study focuses on specifically Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for the first time. Here we present work that focuses on the impact of active learning interventions at Florida A&amp;amp;M University, where we measured the impact of active learning strategies coupled with a SCALE-UP (Student Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies) learning environment on student success in General Biology. In biology sections where active learning techniques were employed, students watched online videos and completed specific activities before class covering information previously presented in a traditional lecture format. In-class activities were then carefully planned to reinforce critical concepts and enhance critical thinking skills through active learning techniques such as the one-minute paper, think-pair-share, and the utilization of clickers. Students in the active learning and control groups covered the same topics, took the same summative examinations and completed identical homework sets. In addition, the same instructor taught all of the sections included in this study. Testing demonstrated that these interventions increased learning gains by as much as 16%, and students reported an increase in their positive perceptions of active learning and biology. Overall, our results suggest that active learning approaches coupled with the SCALE-UP environment may provide an added opportunity for student success when compared with the standard modes of instruction in General Biology.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197916</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The use of an active learning approach in a SCALE-UP learning space improves academic performance in undergraduate General Biology</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gokhan Hacisalihoglu, Desmond Stephens, Lewis Johnson, Maurice Edington&lt;/p&gt;

Accordingly there are many diseases that result directly from either lack or excess of iron. Iron has also been associated with a wide range of other diseases and may have an important role in aging. Yet many molecular and physiological aspects of iron regulation have only been discovered recently and others are still awaiting elucidation. In the last 18 years, after the discovery of the hormone hepcidin, many details of iron regulation have become better understood and a clearer picture is starting to emerge, at least in qualitative terms. However there is still no good quantitative and dynamic description of iron absorption, distribution, storage and mobilization that agrees with the wide array of phenotypes presented in several iron-related diseases. The present work addresses this issue by developing a mathematical model of iron distribution in mice that was calibrated with existing ferrokinetic data and subsequently validated against data from a series of iron disorders, such as hemochromatosis, {beta}-thalassemia, atransferrinemia and anemia of inflammation. To adequately fit the ferrokinetic data required including the following mechanisms: a) the role of transferrin in deliving iron to tissues, b) the induction of hepcidin by high levels of transferrin-bound iron, c) the ferroportin-dependent hepcidin-regulated iron export from tissues, d) the erythropoietin regulation of erythropoiesis, and e) direct NTBI uptake by the liver. The utility of such a model to simulate disease interventions was demonstrated by using it to investigate the outcome of different schedules of transferrin treatment in {beta}-thalassemia.

For example, clustering is often used in the field of single-cell RNA- sequencing in order to identify different cell types present in a tissue sample. There are many algorithms for performing clustering and the results can vary substantially. In particular, the number of groups present in a data set is often unknown and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution we present clustering trees. This visualisation shows the relationships between clusters at multiple resolutions allowing researchers to see how samples move as the number of clusters increases.

For example, clustering is often used in the field of single-cell RNA- sequencing in order to identify different cell types present in a tissue sample. There are many algorithms for performing clustering and the results can vary substantially. In particular, the number of groups present in a data set is often unknown and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution we present clustering trees. This visualisation shows the relationships between clusters at multiple resolutions allowing researchers to see how samples move as the number of clusters increases. In addition, meta-information can be overlaid on the tree to inform the choice of resolution and guide in identification of clusters. We illustrate the features of clustering trees using a series of simulations as well as two real examples, the classical iris dataset and a complex single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011–2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim. Bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to yield odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were a total of 612 IFH claims made in the ED from 2011–2013. The demographic characteristics, acuity of presentation and discharge diagnoses were similar during both the before and after periods. Overall, 28.6% fewer claims were made under the IFH program after the cuts. Of the claims made, significantly more were rejected after the cuts than before (13.7% after vs. 3.9% before, adjusted OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.18–8.40; p&amp;lt;0.05). The majority (75.0%) of rejected claims have not been paid by patients. Fewer patients after the cuts indicated that they had a family physician (20.4% after vs. 30% before, unadjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14–2.44; p&amp;lt;0.05) yet a higher proportion of patients without a family physician were still advised to follow up with their family doctor during the after period (67.2% after vs. 41.8% before, unadjusted OR 2.85, 95% CI: 1.45–5.62; p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of both rejected and subsequently unpaid claims after the IFH cuts in June 2012, as demonstrated in the logistic regression analysis in this health records review, represents a potential barrier to emergency medical care, as well as a new financial burden to be shouldered by patients and hospitals. A reduction in IFH claims in the ED and a reduction in the number of patients with access to a family physician also suggests inadequate primary care for this population, yet this was not reflected in the follow-up advice offered by ED physicians to patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197282</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Use of the emergency department by refugees under the Interim Federal Health Program: A health records review</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francis Bakewell, Sarah Addleman, Garth Dickinson, Venkatesh Thiruganasambandamoorthy&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an attractive approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. AMPK activation reduces glucose levels in animal models of type 2 diabetes by increasing glucose uptake in skeletal muscles and reducing hepatic glucose production. Furthermore, AMPK activation ameliorates hepatic steatosis in animal models. For the clinical development of AMPK activators it is essential to have a reliable target engagement marker for appropriate dose finding and to support proof of clinical principle. While the activation of AMPK by quantification of the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; in target tissues can be assessed pre-clinically, this is not feasible in clinical studies. Therefore, we attempted to identify and translate a peripheral target engagement biomarker downstream of AMPK activation for clinical use in blood samples.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;For pharmacological activation of AMPK, two AMPK activators were synthesized (compound 1 and 2). A compound with structural similarities but no pharmacological effect on AMPK phosphorylation was synthesized as negative control (compound 3). Whole blood from healthy volunteers was incubated with an AMPK activator for up to 6 hours and mRNA sequencing was performed. Additionally, human PBMCs were isolated to evaluate Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in Western blots. In order to enable identification of translatable biomarker candidates, blood samples from HanWistar rats treated for two weeks with an AMPK activator were also subjected to mRNA sequencing. Furthermore, concentration-response curves for four biomarker candidates were recorded in human blood samples using Nanostring nCounter technology. Finally, ZDF rats were treated with increasing doses of compound 2 for five weeks to investigate the glucose-lowering efficacy. To investigate changes of mRNA expression of two selected biomarker candidates in this ZDF rat study, qRT-PCR was performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Pharmacological activation of AMPK in human PBMCs revealed an increase in Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK, confirming target engagement in these blood cells. RNA sequencing of human blood samples identified 608 deregulated genes after AMPK activation. Additionally, AMPK activation led to deregulation of 367 genes in whole blood from HanWistar rats which mapped to the respective human genes. 22 genes out of the intersection of genes deregulated in both species are proposed as potential translatable target engagement biomarker candidates. The most prominent genes were transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB, osteoactivin), calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGLYRP1) and Ras homolog gene family, member B (RHOB). Specificity for AMPK was shown by testing inactive compound 3 in HanWistar rats. The exposure-effect relationship for GPNMB was investigated in a subchronic study in diabetic ZDF rats. GPNMB showed a dose-dependent up-regulation both acutely and after subchronic dosing. GPNMB up-regulation correlated with an increased Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in liver and quadriceps muscle in rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;GPNMB has been identified as a translatable target engagement biomarker for use in clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197849</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Discovery and translation of a target engagement marker for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rolf Grempler, Michael Wolff, Eric Simon, Ramona Schmid, Claudia Eisele, Kathrin Rieber, Elke Fischer, Sonja Mettel, Ogsen Gabrielyan, Denis Delic, Gerd Luippold, Norbert Redeman&lt;/p&gt;

GPNMB up-regulation correlated with an increased Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in liver and quadriceps muscle in rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;GPNMB has been identified as a translatable target engagement biomarker for use in clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527282000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Rolf Grempler</name></author><fingerprint>7d9b7cd3</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197849</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197849</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85444:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197792</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Lavedán, Maria Viladrosa, Pilar Jürschik, Teresa Botigué, Carmen Nuín, Olga Masot, Raquel Lavedán&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197792</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: Fear of falling in community-dwelling older adults: A cause of falls, a consequence, or both?</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Lavedán, Maria Viladrosa, Pilar Jürschik, Teresa Botigué, Carmen Nuín, Olga Masot, Raquel Lavedán&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Ana Lavedán</name></author><fingerprint>ffd30d13</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197792</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197792</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1527523678609</crawled><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163a7819991:185fc93:3dd877af</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319160v1?rss=1</originId><description>Aromatic interactions make an important contribution to protein structure, function, folding and have attracted intense study. Earlier studies on a recombinant xylanase from Bacillus sp.

We provide here a network perspective of aromatic-aromatic interactions in terms of aromatic clique community and long-range association. Our study reveals that disruption of long-range k-clique aromatic interaction cluster holding the N- and C-terminal regions are associated with the decreased stability of the enzyme. The present work reiterates as well as expands on those findings concerning the role of interactions between the N- and C-terminus in protein stability. Furthermore, comparative analyses of crystal structures of homologous pairs of proteins from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms emphasize the prevalence of long-range k-clique communities of aromatic interaction that may be playing an important role and highlights an additional source of stability in thermophilic proteins.

Background &lt;p&gt;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke unless treated with an anticoagulant. Detecting AF can be difficult because AF is often paroxysmal and asymptomatic. The aims of this study were to develop a screening model to detect AF in a primary healthcare setting and to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy in high-risk patients to prevent stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study. All 70- to 74-year-old individuals registered at a single primary healthcare center in Stockholm were invited to participate in AF screening upon visiting the center during a ten-month period. Those who did not have contact with the center during this period were invited to participate by letter. Thirty-second intermittent ECG recordings were made twice a day using a handheld Zenicor device over a 2-week period in participants without AF. Oral anticoagulant therapy was offered to patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Of the 415 eligible individuals, a total of 324 (78.1%) patients participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 72 years, 52.2% were female, and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score of the participants was 3. In the target population, 34 (8.2%) individuals had previously diagnosed AF. Among participants without previously known AF, 16 (5.5%) cases of AF were detected. The final AF prevalence in the target population was 12%. Oral anticoagulant therapy was successfully initiated in 88% of these patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The AF screening project exhibited a high participation rate and resulted in a high rate of newly discovered AF; of these newly diagnosed patients, 88% could be treated with an oral anticoagulant.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198069</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Feasibility and outcomes of atrial fibrillation screening using intermittent electrocardiography in a primary healthcare setting: A cross-sectional study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Faris Ghazal, Holger Theobald, Mårten Rosenqvist, Faris Al-Khalili&lt;/p&gt;

Cryptopain1, a cysteine protease characterized in the genome of Cryptosporidium parvum, had been earlier shown to be inhibited by a vinyl sulfone compound called K11777 (or K777). Cysteine proteases have long been established as valid drug targets, which can be covalently and selectively inhibited by vinyl sulfones. This computational study was initiated to identify purchasable vinyl sulfone compounds, which could possibly inhibit cryptopain1 with higher efficacy than K11777.

By demonstrating the intrinsic diversity of skeletal muscles, these data provide a resource for studying the mechanisms of tissue specialization.</description><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item></keywords><title>Transcriptional profiling reveals extraordinary diversity among skeletal muscle tissues</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>michael.hughes@wustl.edu (Christy Hoffmann)</name></author><fingerprint>26b9285b</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34613</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34613</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>197</engagement><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce96c:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/835?rss=1</originId><published>1527183688000</published><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/835.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Editorials</item></keywords><title>Canada&apos;s call</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Nemer, M.</name></author><fingerprint>e8f4d15c</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/835?rss=1</href></item></alternate><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/835?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526052472894</crawled><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_1634fd0c83e:1d2c07b:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0112-6</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Single-cell analysis of experience-dependent transcriptomic states in the mouse visual cortex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Single-cell analysis of experience-dependent transcriptomic states in the mouse visual cortex, Published online: 11 May 2018;

However, one challenge in accurately characterizing microbial communities is exogenous bacterial DNA contamination. This is particularly problematic for sites of low microbial biomass such as the urinary tract, placenta, and lower airway. Computational approaches have been proposed as a post-processing step to identify and remove potential contaminants, but their performance has not been independently evaluated. To identify the impact of decreasing microbial biomass on polymicrobial 16S rRNA gene sequencing experiments, we used a serial dilution of a mock microbial community. We evaluated two computational approaches to identify and remove contaminants: 1) identifying sequences that have an inverse correlation with DNA concentration implemented in Decontam and 2) predicting the proportion of experimental sample arising from defined contaminant sources implemented in SourceTracker. Results: As expected, the proportion of contaminant bacterial DNA increased with decreasing starting microbial biomass, with 79.12% of the most dilute sample arising from contaminant sequences. Inclusion of contaminant sequences in analyses leads to overinflated diversity estimates (up to 12 times greater than the expected values) and distorts microbiome composition. SourceTracker successfully removed over 98% of contaminants when the experimental environments are well defined. However, SourceTracker performed poorly when the experimental environment is unknown, failing to remove the majority of contaminants. Decontam successfully removed 74 - 91% of contaminants regardless of prior knowledge of the experimental environment. Conclusions: Our study indicates that computational methods can reduce the amount of contaminants in 16S rRNA gene sequencing experiments. The appropriate computational approach for removing contaminant sequences from an experiment depends on the prior knowledge about the microbial environment under investigation and can be evaluated with a dilution series of a mock microbial community.</description><published>1527231600000</published><fingerprint>7de5d1bc</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329854v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Microbial communities are commonly studied using culture-independent methods such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

We also identified domain-specific exceptions: goal-dependent encoding of prosocial attributes localized to precuneus and temporo-parietal junction (not DLPFC). Our results suggest that cognitive regulation operated by changing specific attribute representations (not integrated values). Evidence of domain-general and domain-specific neural loci reveals important divisions of labor, explaining when and why regulatory success generalizes (or doesn’t) across contexts and domains.</description><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><title>Cognitive regulation alters social and dietary choice by changing attribute representations in domain-general and domain-specific brain circuits</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>anita.tusche@gmail.com (Anita Tusche)</name></author><fingerprint>6c2c7dca</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31185</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31185</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1525793219829</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163405ce4f5:39c5c3:93d646dc</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022701?af=R</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525667424000</published><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022701?af=R</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/17&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Valence and charge-transfer optical properties for some SinCm (m, n [math] 12) clusters: Comparing TD-DFT, complete-basis-limit EOMCC, and benchmarks from spectroscopy</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Jesse J.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to reveal the factors associated with virologic failure in sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV)-treated patients, and identify baseline NS5A or NS5B resistance-associated substitutions (RASs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Four hundred ninety-three patients with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection were treated with SOF/LDV; 31 had a history of interferon (IFN)-free treatment with daclatasvir and asunaprevir. The effect of baseline RASs on the response to SOF/LDV therapy was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12) was achieved in 476 patients (96.6%). The SVR12 rates in the patients with IFN-free treatment-naïve and retreatment were 97.6% and 80.6%, respectively. HCV elimination was not achieved in 17 patients, 11 (including 5 with IFN-free retreatment) of whom had virologic failure. Eight patients had coexisting NS5A RASs of Q24, L28 and/or R30, L31, or Y93 and one patient had coexisting NS5A RASs of P32L and A92K. Interestingly, 10 and 8 patients had NS5B A218S and C316N RAS respectively. According to a multivariate analysis, coexisting NS5A RASs, NS5A P32 RAS, NS5B A218 and/or C316 RASs, and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase were associated with virologic failure. In the naïve patients, all patients without NS5B A218 and/or C316 RAS achieved an SVR12. Notably, the SVR12 rates of patients with coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were significantly lower (83.3%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although SOF/LDV therapy resulted in a high SVR12 rate, coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were associated with virologic failure. These results might indicate that the coexisting baseline RASs influence the therapeutic effects of SOF/LDV.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198642</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The co-existence of NS5A and NS5B resistance-associated substitutions is associated with virologic failure in Hepatitis C Virus genotype 1 patients treated with sofosbuvir and ledipasvir</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seiichi Mawatari, Kohei Oda, Kazuaki Tabu, Sho Ijuin, Kotaro Kumagai, Kunio Fujisaki, Masafumi Hashiguchi, Yukiko Inada, Hirofumi Uto, Yasunari Hiramine, Takeshi Kure, Takeshi Hori, Oki Taniyama, Ai Kasai, Tsutomu Tamai, Akihiro Moriuchi, Akio Ido&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;We sought to develop a novel risk assessment tool to predict the clinical outcomes after heat-related illness.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Prospective, multicenter observational study. Patients who transferred to emergency hospitals in Japan with heat-related illness were registered. The sample was divided into two parts: 60% to construct the score and 40% to validate it. A binary logistic regression model was used to predict hospital admission as a primary outcome. The resulting model was transformed into a scoring system.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 3,001 eligible patients were analyzed. There was no difference in variables between development and validation cohorts. Based on the result of a logistic regression model in the development phase (n = 1,805), the J-ERATO score was defined as the sum of the six binary components in the prehospital setting (respiratory rate≥22 /min, Glasgow coma scale&amp;lt;15, systolic blood pressure≤100 mmHg, heart rate≥100 bpm, body temperature≥38°C, and age≥65 y), for a total score ranging from 0 to 6. In the validation phase (n = 1,196), the score had excellent discrimination (C-statistic 0.84; 95% CI 0.79–0.89, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and calibration (P&gt;0.2 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The observed proportion of hospital admission increased with increasing J-ERATO score (score = 0, 5.0%; score = 1, 15.0%; score = 2, 24.6%; score = 3, 38.6%; score = 4, 68.0%; score = 5, 85.2%; score = 6, 96.4%). Multivariate analyses showed that the J-ERATO score was an independent positive predictor of hospital admission (adjusted OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.06–2.87; P&amp;lt;0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (3.73; 2.95–4.72; P&amp;lt;0.001) and in-hospital mortality (1.65; 1.18–2.32; P = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The J-ERATO score is simply assessed and can facilitate the identification of patients with higher risk of heat-related hospitalization.

Background &lt;p&gt;We sought to develop a novel risk assessment tool to predict the clinical outcomes after heat-related illness.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Prospective, multicenter observational study. Patients who transferred to emergency hospitals in Japan with heat-related illness were registered. The sample was divided into two parts: 60% to construct the score and 40% to validate it. A binary logistic regression model was used to predict hospital admission as a primary outcome. The resulting model was transformed into a scoring system.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 3,001 eligible patients were analyzed. There was no difference in variables between development and validation cohorts. Based on the result of a logistic regression model in the development phase (n = 1,805), the J-ERATO score was defined as the sum of the six binary components in the prehospital setting (respiratory rate≥22 /min, Glasgow coma scale&amp;lt;15, systolic blood pressure≤100 mmHg, heart rate≥100 bpm, body temperature≥38°C, and age≥65 y), for a total score ranging from 0 to 6.

A common goal in data-analysis is to sift through a large data-matrix and detect any significant submatrices (i.e., biclusters) that have a low numerical rank. We present a simple algorithm for tackling this biclustering problem. Our algorithm accumulates information about 2-by-2 submatrices (i.e., ‘loops’) within the data-matrix, and focuses on rows and columns of the data-matrix that participate in an abundance of low-rank loops. We demonstrate, through analysis and numerical-experiments, that this loop-counting method performs well in a variety of scenarios, outperforming simple spectral methods in many situations of interest. Another important feature of our method is that it can easily be modified to account for aspects of experimental design which commonly arise in practice. For example, our algorithm can be modified to correct for controls, categorical- and continuous-covariates, as well as sparsity within the data. We demonstrate these practical features with two examples; the first drawn from gene-expression analysis and the second drawn from a much larger genome-wide-association-study (GWAS).&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbY469xyEU0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526331600000</published><fingerprint>fafdb084</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006105</link><title>A loop-counting method for covariate-corrected low-rank biclustering of gene-expression and genome-wide association study data</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aaditya V.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Mucositis is a side effect of chemotherapy seen in the digestive tract, with symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, inflammation and ulcerations. Our aim was to investigate whether endogenous glucagon-like peptide -1 and -2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2) are implicated in intestinal healing after chemotherapy-induced mucositis.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We used a transgenic mouse model Tg(GCG.DTR)(Tg) expressing the human diphtheria toxin receptor in the proglucagon-producing cells. Injections with diphtheria toxin ablated the GLP-1 and GLP-2 producing L-cells in Tg mice with no effect in wild-type (WT) mice. Mice were injected with 5-fluorouracil or saline and received vehicle, exendin-4, teduglutide (gly2-GLP-2), or exendin-4/teduglutide in combination. The endpoints were body weight change, small intestinal weight, morphology, histological scoring of mucositis and myeloperoxidase levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ablation of L-cells led to impaired GLP-2 secretion; increased loss of body weight; lower small intestinal weight; lower crypt depth, villus height and mucosal area; and increased the mucositis severity score in mice given 5-fluorouracil. WT mice showed compensatory hyperproliferation as a sign of regeneration in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide rescued the body weight of the Tg mice and led to a hyperproliferation in the small intestine, whereas single treatment was less effective.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The ablation of L-cells leads to severe mucositis and insufficient intestinal healing, shown by severe body weight loss and lack of compensatory hyperproliferation in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide could prevent this.

part. Here we present RAFE calculations of hydration free energies for a set of small
organic molecules and demonstrate that free energies can be reproduced to within about
0.2 kcal/mol with aforementioned codes. Achieving this level of reproducibility requires
considerable attention to detail and package–specific simulation protocols, and no uni-
versally applicable protocol emerges. The benchmarks and protocols reported here
should be useful for the community to validate new and future versions of software for
free energy calculations.</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Reproducibility_of_Free_Energy_Calculations_Across_Different_Molecular_Simulation_Software/6402425</link><title>Reproducibility of Free Energy Calculations Across Different Molecular Simulation Software</title><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Reproducibility_of_Free_Energy_Calculations_Across_Different_Molecular_Simulation_Software/6402425</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>139</engagement><crawled>1527240227150</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163969c794e:29b962:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04393-4</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stark control of electrons along nanojunctions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stark control of electrons along nanojunctions, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04393-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04393-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Strong non-resonant few-cycle laser pulses can be used to induce ultrafast phase-controllable currents along nanojunctions but the microscopic origin is unclear.

Background &lt;p&gt;When attempting to statistically distinguish between a null and an alternative hypothesis, many researchers in the life and social sciences turn to binned statistical analysis methods, or methods that are simply based on the moments of a distribution (such as the mean, and variance). These methods have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and simplicity of explanation.However, when null and alternative hypotheses manifest themselves in subtle differences in patterns in the data, binned analysis methods may be insensitive to these differences, and researchers may erroneously fail to reject the null hypothesis when in fact more sensitive statistical analysis methods might produce a different result when the null hypothesis is actually false.Here, with a focus on two recent conflicting studies of contagion in mass killings as instructive examples, we discuss how the use of unbinned likelihood methods makes optimal use of the information in the data; a fact that has been long known in statistical theory, but perhaps is not as widely appreciated amongst general researchers in the life and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; published a paper that quantified the long-suspected contagion effect in mass killings. However, in 2017, Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek subsequently published a paper, based upon the same data, that claimed to contradict the results of the earlier study. The former used unbinned likelihood methods, and the latter used binned methods, and comparison of distribution moments.Using these analyses, we also discuss how visualization of the data can aid in determination of the most appropriate statistical analysis methods to distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis. We also discuss the importance of assessment of the robustness of analysis results to methodological assumptions made (for example, arbitrary choices of number of bins and bin widths when using binned methods); an issue that is widely overlooked in the literature, but is critical to analysis reproducibility and robustness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;When an analysis cannot distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis, care must be taken to ensure that the analysis methodology itself maximizes the use of information in the data that can distinguish between the two hypotheses.The use of binned methods by Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek (2017), that examined how many mass killings fell within a 14 day window from a previous mass killing, substantially reduced the sensitivity of their analysis to contagion effects. The unbinned likelihood methods used by Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; (2015) did not suffer from this problem.While a binned analysis might be favorable for simplicity and clarity of presentation, unbinned likelihood methods are preferable when effects might be somewhat subtle.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196863</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Detecting the contagion effect in mass killings; a constructive example of the statistical advantages of unbinned likelihood methods</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sherry Towers, Anuj Mubayi, Carlos Castillo-Chavez&lt;/p&gt;

Biodiversity loss in riparian forests has the potential to alter rates of leaf litter decomposition in stream ecosystems. However, studies have reported the full range of positive, negative and no effects of plant diversity loss on decomposition, and there is currently no explanation for such inconsistent results. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether plant diversity loss affects other ecological processes related to decomposition, such as fine particulate organic matter production or detritivore growth, which precludes a thorough understanding of how detrital stream food webs are impacted by plant diversity loss. We used a microcosm experiment to examine the effects of plant diversity loss on litter decomposition, fine particulate organic matter production, and growth of a dominant leaf-shredding detritivore, using litter mixtures varying in species composition. We hypothesized that plant diversity loss would decrease the rates of all studied processes, but such effects would depend on the leaf traits present in litter mixtures (both their average values and their variability). Our findings partly supported our hypotheses, showing that plant diversity loss had a consistently negative effect on litter decomposition and fine particulate organic matter production (but not on detritivore growth) across litter mixtures, which was mediated by detritivores. Importantly, the magnitude of the diversity effect and the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying this effect (i.e., complementarity vs. selection) varied depending on the species composition of litter mixtures, mainly because of differences in litter nutritional quality and trait variability. Complementarity was prevalent but varied in size, with positive selection effects also occurring in some mixtures. Our results support the notion that loss of riparian plant species is detrimental to key stream ecosystem processes that drive detrital food webs, but that the magnitude of such effects largely depends on the the order of species loss.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198243</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Leaf traits drive plant diversity effects on litter decomposition and FPOM production in streams</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naiara López-Rojo, Aingeru Martínez, Javier Pérez, Ana Basaguren, Jesús Pozo, Luz Boyero&lt;/p&gt;

DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are important DNA lesions induced by endogenous crosslinking agents such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde, as well as ionizing radiation, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, and abortive action of some enzymes. Due to their very bulky nature, they are expected to interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis and DNA repair. DPCs are highly genotoxic and the ability of cells to deal with them is relevant for many chemotherapeutic interventions. However, interactions of DNA polymerases with DPCs have been poorly studied due to the lack of a convenient experimental model. We have used NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-induced trapping of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase with DNA to construct model DNA polymerase substrates containing a DPC in single-stranded template, or in the template strand of double-stranded DNA, or in the non-template (displaced) strand of double-stranded DNA. Nine DNA polymerases belonging to families A, B, X, and Y were studied with respect to their behavior upon encountering a DPC: Klenow fragment of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase I, &lt;i&gt;Thermus aquaticus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase I, &lt;i&gt;Pyrococcus furiosus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase, &lt;i&gt;Sulfolobus solfataricus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase IV, human DNA polymerases β, κ and λ, and DNA polymerases from bacteriophages T4 and RB69. Although none were able to fully bypass DPCs in any context, Family B DNA polymerases (T4, RB69) and Family Y DNA polymerase IV were able to elongate the primer up to the site of the cross-link if a DPC was located in single-stranded template or in the displaced strand. In other cases, DNA synthesis stopped 4–5 nucleotides before the site of the cross-link in single-stranded template or in double-stranded DNA if the polymerases could displace the downstream strand. We suggest that termination of DNA polymerases on a DPC is mostly due to the unrelieved conformational strain experienced by the enzyme when pressing against the cross-linked protein molecule.</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198480</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Variable termination sites of DNA polymerases encountering a DNA–protein cross-link</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anna V.

However, the actual state of the body of bioinformatics software remains largely unknown. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the state of source code in the bioinformatics community, specifically looking at relationships between code properties, development activity, developer communities, and software impact. To investigate these issues, we curated a list of 1,720 bioinformatics repositories on GitHub through their mention in peer-reviewed bioinformatics articles. Additionally, we included 23 high-profile repositories identified by their popularity in an online bioinformatics forum. We analyzed repository metadata, source code, development activity, and team dynamics using data made available publicly through the GitHub API, as well as article metadata. We found key relationships within our dataset, including: certain scientific topics are associated with more active code development and higher community interest in the repository; most of the code in the main dataset is written in dynamically typed languages, while most of the code in the high-profile set is statically typed; developer team size is associated with community engagement and high-profile repositories have larger teams; the proportion of female contributors decreases for high-profile repositories and with seniority level in author lists; and, multiple measures of project impact are associated with the simple variable of whether the code was modified at all after paper publication.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) infections in the hemodialysis (HD) population are epidemiologically classified as healthcare-associated infections.

Coral reefs protect islands from tropical storm waves and provide goods and services for millions of islanders worldwide. Yet it is unknown how coral reefs in general, and carbonate production in particular, will respond to sea-level rise and thermal stress associated with climate change. This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether that value varied across habitats. Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs. The value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production became negative varied across habitats, with highest values on inner reefs. These results suggest that some inner reefs tend to produce less carbonate, and therefore need higher coral cover to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise than outer and patch reefs. These results also suggest that inner reefs are more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other habitats, which stresses the need for effective land-use practices as the climate continues to change. Averaging across all reef habitats, the rate of carbonate production was 9.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 7.9 mm y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of potential vertical accretion. Such rates of vertical accretion are higher than projected averages of sea-level rise for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate-change scenarios 2.6, 4.5, and 6, but lower than for the RCP scenario 8.5.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Keeping up with sea-level rise: Carbonate production rates in Palau and Yap, western Pacific Ocean</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert van Woesik, Christopher William Cacciapaglia&lt;/p&gt;

Here, we describe the Virtual Metabolic Human (VMH, http://vmh.life) database encapsulating current knowledge of human metabolism within five interlinked resources &amp;quot;Human metabolism&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Gut microbiome&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Disease&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Nutrition&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;ReconMaps&amp;quot;. The VMH captures 5,180 unique metabolites, 17,730 unique reactions, 3,288 human genes, 255 Mendelian diseases, 818 microbes, 632,685 microbial genes, and 8,790 food items. The VMH&apos;s unique features are i) the hosting the metabolic reconstructions of human and gut microbes amenable for metabolic modeling; ii) seven human metabolic maps for data visualization; iii) a nutrition designer; iv) a user-friendly webpage and application-programming interface to access its content; and v) user feedback option for community engagement. We demonstrate with four examples the VMH&apos;s utility. The VMH represents a novel, interdisciplinary database for data interpretation and hypothesis generation to the biomedical community.</content></content><title>The Virtual Metabolic Human database: integrating human and gut microbiome metabolism with nutrition and disease [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Noronha, A.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/15/321331</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321331v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526545207533</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1636d2f50ed:47c65fa:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24853-7</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24853-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24853-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/7A__SGOLens&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526540400000</published><fingerprint>6d83b20d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24853-7</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24853-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24853-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/7A__SGOLens&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>M.

The development of new dosimeters with good dosimetric properties is important for quality control in radiation applications. A new practical electron spin resonance (ESR) dosimeter based on carbonated hydroxyapatite that simulated the composition and structure of tooth enamel was specially synthesized. The synthesized material was investigated by transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy to confirm to the main composition of carbonated hydroxyapatite with CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; successfully doped into the crystal lattice through optimizing the synthesis process of C/P molar ratio, pH value dynamical adjustment, annealing temperature and time. The dosimetric properties were systematically investigated by ESR spectroscopy. The results indicated that the radiation induced signal had a good dose response within a relatively wide dose range. The dose response was linear in the dose range of 0–400 Gy with a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 and had dose accumulative effect in the experimental dose range of 0–100 Gy. In a wider dose range up to 30 kGy, the dose response also presented linear feature in double-logarithmic coordinate system with a correlation coefficient of 0.9970. The dose detection limit was about 0.34Gy with a given probability of 95% confidence level depending upon a rigid calculation algorithm. The signal was extremely stable in the observation time of 360 days with a variation coefficient of 3.8%. The radiation sensitivity of the material showed no remarkable variation against photon energy from 662 KeV to 1.25 MeV and dose rate from 0.86 Gy/min to 12.17 Gy/min. The material showed more sensitive in lower photon energy range below 662 keV, which hint additional calibration may need when using in special photon energy condition. The preliminary results suggested that this newly developed dosimeter was potential to become a practical dosimeter that would expand the application fields of ESR dosimetry.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197953</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Study of new practical ESR dosimeter based on carbonated hydroxyapatite and its dosimetric properties</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ye Liu, Lei Ma, Junwang Guo, Guofu Dong, Jianbo Cong, Yunlong Ji, Jing Ning, Guoshan Yang, Ke Wu&lt;/p&gt;

In cases of impending natural disasters, most events are uncertain and emotionally relevant, both critical factors for decision-making. Moreover, for exposed individuals, the sensitivity to the framing of the consequences (gain or loss) and the moral judgments they have to perform (e.g., evacuate or help an injured person) constitute two central effects that have never been examined in the same context of decision-making. In a framed decision-making task with moral dilemma, we investigated whether uncertainty (i.e., unpredictably of events) and a threatening context would influence the framing effect (actions framed in loss are avoided in comparison to the ones framed in gain) and the personal intention effect (unintentional actions are more morally acceptable in comparison to intentional actions) on the perceived moral acceptability of taking action. Considering the impact of uncertainty and fear on the processes underlying these effects, we assumed that these emotions would lead to the negation of the two effects. Our results indicate that the exposure to uncertain events leads to the negation of the framing effect, but does not influence the moral acceptability and the effect of personal intention. We discuss our results in the light of dual-process models (i.e. systematic &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. heuristic), appraisal theories, and neurocognitive aspects. These elements highlight the importance of providing solutions to cope with uncertainty, both for scientists and local populations exposed to natural hazards.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197923</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Influence of uncertainty on framed decision-making with moral dilemma</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gaëtan Merlhiot, Martial Mermillod, Jean-Luc Le Pennec, Frédéric Dutheil, Laurie Mondillon&lt;/p&gt;
In cases of impending natural disasters, most events are uncertain and emotionally relevant, both critical factors for decision-making. Moreover, for exposed individuals, the sensitivity to the framing of the consequences (gain or loss) and the moral judgments they have to perform (e.g., evacuate or help an injured person) constitute two central effects that have never been examined in the same context of decision-making. In a framed decision-making task with moral dilemma, we investigated whether uncertainty (i.e., unpredictably of events) and a threatening context would influence the framing effect (actions framed in loss are avoided in comparison to the ones framed in gain) and the personal intention effect (unintentional actions are more morally acceptable in comparison to intentional actions) on the perceived moral acceptability of taking action. Considering the impact of uncertainty and fear on the processes underlying these effects, we assumed that these emotions would lead to the negation of the two effects. Our results indicate that the exposure to uncertain events leads to the negation of the framing effect, but does not influence the moral acceptability and the effect of personal intention. We discuss our results in the light of dual-process models (i.e. systematic &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. heuristic), appraisal theories, and neurocognitive aspects.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of exercise training with modest or greater weight loss (≥3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) on insulin sensitivity, lipoprotein concentrations, and lipoprotein particle size in overweight and obese participants.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Adults (N = 163, body mass index: 25–37 [kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]) participated in 8 months of exercise training. Insulin sensitivity, lipid concentrations, lipid particle size and other cardiometabolic variables were measured at baseline and follow-up. Participants were categorized by whether they achieved at least modest weight loss (≥ 3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) following the intervention.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A greater improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in adults performing exercise training with at least modest weight loss (2.2 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 1.5 to 2.8) compared to those who did not (0.8 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 0.5 to 1.2). Similar results were observed for acute insulin response, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol concentration, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size (p&amp;lt;0.05), when all exercise groups were combined. No significant results across weight loss categories were observed for LDL, HDL, glucose, or insulin levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The present study suggests that aerobic exercise combined with at least modest weight loss leads to greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, triglycerides as well as other non-traditional lipid risk factors (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL/LDL particle size). Clinicians should advocate patients who are overweight/obese to exercise and obtain modest weight loss for improved cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196637</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Effects of aerobic training with and without weight loss on insulin sensitivity and lipids</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Damon L.

Hair growth disorders often carry a major psychological burden. Therefore, more effective human hair growth–modulatory agents urgently need to be developed. Here, we used the hypertrichosis-inducing immunosuppressant, Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a lead compound to identify new hair growth–promoting molecular targets. Through microarray analysis we identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-regulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/β-catenin activity through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collectively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non–immune-inhibitory CsA target; (b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical β-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new promoter of human hair growth. Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through ligands that are already present, this ‘ligand-limited’ therapeutic strategy for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt over-activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0-d2BFNTwPU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1525813200000</published><fingerprint>eed50c14</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Identifying novel strategies for treating human hair loss disorders: Cyclosporine A suppresses the Wnt inhibitor, SFRP1, in the dermal papilla of human scalp hair follicles</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan J.

SequencEnG is part of the project KnowEnG (Knowledge Engine for Genomics) and is freely available at http://education.knoweng.org/sequenceng/.</content></content><title>SequencEnG: an Interactive Knowledge Base of Sequencing Techniques [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Zhang, Y.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/10/319079</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319079v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b91:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197470</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Weiwei Xia, Chenjun Liu, Shuo Duan, Shuai Xu, Kaifeng Wang, Zhenqi Zhu, Haiying Liu&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;The typical degeneration of the vertebral endplate shown in MRI imaging is Modic change. The aim of this study was to observe the distribution of the Modic changes of vertebral endplate in degenerative thoracolumbar/lumbar kyphosis (DTK/LK) patients and analyse the correlation between spinal-pelvic parameters and Modic changes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The imaging data of 58 patients diagnosed with DTK/LK (coronal Cobb angle&amp;lt;10°with sagittal imbalance) in our hospital from March 2016 to May 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Observe the prevalence, type and distribution characteristics of Modic changes occurred at the vertebral endplate from T10 to S1;analyse the correlation between Modic changes and disc degeneration, the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), lumbar lordosis (LL), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT) and pelvic incidence (PI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 928 intervertebral endplates from 58 patients, Modic changes occurred at 90 endplates (9.7%) of 30 patients (51.7%). 5 endplates (0.5%) of 3 patients (5.2%) were classified as type I, 68 endplates (7.3%) of 25 patients (43.1%) as type II, 17 endplates (1.8%) of 9 patients (15.5%) as type III. The location of the degenerative endplates: 2 (2.2%) superior and inferior endplates of L1, 3 (3.3%) inferior endplates of T11and T12, 4 (4.4%) superior endplates of L2, 6 (6.7%) inferior endplates of L2 and L4, 8 (8.9%) superior endplates of S1, 9 (10%) superior endplates of L3, 11 (12.2%) inferior endplates of L3 and L5 and superior endplates of L4, 12 (13.3%) superior endplates of L5. Modic changes were significantly correlated with intervertebral disc degeneration (r = 0.414, p&amp;lt;0.01); the amount of Modic changes were significantly correlated with LL (r = -0.562, p = 0.012), SS (r = -0.46, p = 0.048), PT (r = 0.516, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Most of the Modic changes of vertebral endplates in DTK/LK patients are type II which are prevalently located at L3/4, L4/5 and L5/S1.

Bloodstream infection (BSI) and associated sepsis represent a major source of mortality in industrialized countries. Prompt treatment with targeted antibiotics affects both the financial impact and the clinical outcome of BSI: every hour gained in initiating the correct antimicrobial therapy significantly increases the probability of patient survival. However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%. The clinical significance of discrepant results was evaluated reviewing the patients’ clinical records and the results of additional relevant microbiological tests. The data here obtained support the ability of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay to identify a broad range of bacteria directly from primary whole blood samples, within eight hours. This might allow a timely administration of a suitable treatment.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197436</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Rapid diagnosis of bloodstream infections in the critically ill: Evaluation of the broad-range PCR/ESI-MS technology</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Tassinari, Silvia Zannoli, Patrizia Farabegoli, Maria Federica Pedna, Anna Pierro, Antonio Mastroianni, Riccardo Fontan, Luciano Luongo, Giuseppe Sarnataro, Elisa Menegatti, Assunta Caruso, Vittorio Sambri&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Increased hepatic insulin clearance (HIC) is important in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study is to analyze an effective insulin resistance (IR) index that is minimally affected by HIC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Our study involved 20 participants with T2DM and 21 healthy participants without diabetes (Non-DM). Participants underwent a meal tolerance test from which plasma glucose, insulin and serum C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) were measured, and HOMA-IR and HIC were calculated. Participants then underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp from which the glucose disposal rate (GDR) was measured.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The index CPR-IR = 20/(fasting CPR × fasting plasma glucose) was correlated more strongly with GDR, than was HOMA-IR, and CPR-IR could be used to estimate GDR. In T2DM participants with HIC below the median, HOMA-IR and CPR-IR were equally well correlated with GDR. In T2DM with high HIC, CPR-IR correlated with GDR while HOMA-IR did not. In Non-DM, CPR-IR and HOMA-IR were equally well correlated with GDR regardless of HIC. The mean HIC value in T2DM was significantly higher than that of Non-DM.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CPR-IR could be a simple and effective index of insulin resistance for patients with type 2 diabetes that is minimally affected by HIC.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197663</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>CPR-IR is an insulin resistance index that is minimally affected by hepatic insulin clearance—A preliminary research</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tsuyoshi Okura, Risa Nakamura, Yohei Fujioka, Sonoko Kawamoto-Kitao, Yuichi Ito, Kazuhisa Matsumoto, Kyoko Shoji, Keisuke Sumi, Kazuhiko Matsuzawa, Shoichiro Izawa, Etsuko Ueta, Masahiko Kato, Takeshi Imamura, Shin-ichi Taniguchi, Kazuhiro Yamamoto&lt;/p&gt;

It has been observed that the number of phonemes in languages in use today tends to decrease with increasing distance from Africa. A previous formal model has recently reproduced the observed cline, but under two strong assumptions. Here we tackle the question of whether an alternative explanation for the worldwide phonemic cline is possible, by using alternative assumptions. The answer is affirmative. We show this by formalizing a proposal, following Atkinson, that this pattern may be due to a repeated bottleneck effect and phonemic loss. In our simulations, low-density populations lose phonemes during the Out-of-Africa dispersal of modern humans. Our results reproduce the observed global cline for the number of phonemes. In addition, we also detect a cline of phonemic diversity and reproduce it using our simulation model. We suggest how future work could determine whether the previous model or the new one (or even a combination of them) is valid. Simulations also show that the clines can still be present even 300 kyr after the Out-of-Africa dispersal, which is contrary to some previous claims which were not supported by numerical simulations.</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198346</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>A serial founder effect model of phonemic diversity based on phonemic loss in low-density populations</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joaquim Pérez-Losada, Joaquim Fort&lt;/p&gt;

Social networks are getting closer to our real physical world. People share the exact location and time of their check-ins and are influenced by their friends. Modeling the spatio-temporal behavior of users in social networks is of great importance for predicting the future behavior of users, controlling the users’ movements, and finding the latent influence network. It is observed that users have periodic patterns in their movements. Also, they are influenced by the locations that their close friends recently visited. Leveraging these two observations, we propose a probabilistic model based on a doubly stochastic point process with a periodic-decaying kernel for the time of check-ins and a time-varying multinomial distribution for the location of check-ins of users in the location-based social networks. We learn the model parameters by using an efficient EM algorithm, which distributes over the users, and has a linear time complexity. Experiments on synthetic and real data gathered from Foursquare show that the proposed inference algorithm learns the parameters efficiently and our method models the real data better than other alternatives.</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197683</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Recurrent spatio-temporal modeling of check-ins in location-based social networks</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ali Zarezade, Sina Jafarzadeh, Hamid R.

Leveraging these two observations, we propose a probabilistic model based on a doubly stochastic point process with a periodic-decaying kernel for the time of check-ins and a time-varying multinomial distribution for the location of check-ins of users in the location-based social networks. We learn the model parameters by using an efficient EM algorithm, which distributes over the users, and has a linear time complexity. Experiments on synthetic and real data gathered from Foursquare show that the proposed inference algorithm learns the parameters efficiently and our method models the real data better than other alternatives.</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Ali Zarezade</name></author><fingerprint>fd0496ea</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197683</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197683</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>3</engagement><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b795:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198637</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by George Stratigopoulos, Maria Caterina De Rosa, Charles A.

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9) has become the tool of choice for genome editing. Despite the fact that it has evolved as a highly efficient means to edit/replace coding sequence, CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency for “clean” editing of non-coding DNA remains low. We set out to introduce a single base-pair substitution in two intronic SNPs at the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; locus without altering nearby non-coding sequence. Substitution efficiency increased up to 10-fold by treatment of human embryonic stem cells (ESC) with non-toxic levels of DMSO (1%) before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery. Treatment with DMSO did not result in CRISPR/Cas9 off-target effects or compromise the chromosomal stability of the ESC. Twenty-four hour treatment of human ESC with DMSO before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery may prove a simple means to increase editing efficiency of non-coding DNA without incorporation of undesirable mutations.</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198637</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>DMSO increases efficiency of genome editing at two non-coding loci</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by George Stratigopoulos, Maria Caterina De Rosa, Charles A.

In 2015, several provinces in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) experienced a vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak. This survey was conducted (i) to evaluate the vaccination coverage in different settings and cohorts using the seroprevalence of anti-poliovirus (PV) antibodies as a surrogate measure, and (ii) to explore the usefulness of an ELISA in a country with limited resources and a specific epidemiological setting. IgG antibodies were assessed by ELISA in Lao children (n = 1216) and adults (n = 1228), including blood donors and health care workers. Protective antibody titers against the 3 vaccine serotypes were determined by microneutralization (VNT) in a subset of participants. More than 92% of the children had anti-poliovirus antibodies, regardless of nutritional status or access to health care, highlighting the success of the vaccination outreach activities in the country. In contrast, anti-poliovirus seroprevalence reached only 81.7% in blood donors and 71.9% in health care workers. Participants born before the introduction of poliovirus vaccination in Lao PDR were considerably less likely to be seropositive. These findings align with the epidemiology of the outbreak. Neutralizing antibodies against at least one of the 3 poliovirus serotypes were detected in all children (99/99) and 93/99 had antibodies against all serotypes. Similarly, all health care workers had neutralizing antibodies against at least one and 92/99 against all serotypes. The comparison of both assays shows an acceptable underestimation of vaccine coverage in children by ELISA, but a low sensitivity of the ELISA in the adults. We show that the ELISA is a reasonable alternative to the VNT in particular in vaccinated children, that an improved version should be serotype specific, and that negativity thresholds should be revisited for optimal sensitivity and specificity. Thus, polio-free countries with an uncertain vaccination coverage and limited laboratory capacity, that are at risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks or of re-importation of wild poliovirus may benefit from an improved ELISA for cohort studies to evaluate their immunization program in children.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197370</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Immunity levels to poliovirus in Lao children and adults before the vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak: A retrospective study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maude Pauly, Antony P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). The exact influence of ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFL thickness (RNFLT) is unknown and was analysed in a subgroup of the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Global peripapillary RNFLT was measured in 3224 eyes of 1973 subjects (49% female) using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The association of age, sex, ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFLT was analysed using Pearson correlation coefficient and fitting a linear mixed model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the univariable analysis highest correlations were found for axial length (r = -0.27), spherical equivalent (r = 0.24), and glaucoma (r = -0.15) (p&amp;lt;0.0001, respectively). Other significant correlations with RNFLT were found for age, sex, intraocular pressure, systemic hypertension and systolic blood pressure, previous eye surgery, cholesterol, homocysteine, history of coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, apnoea, diabetes and alcohol intake, p&amp;lt;0.05, respectively. Body length, body weight, BMI, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1c, history of apoplexy, cognitive function, peripheral artery disease, tinnitus, migraine, nicotine intake, central corneal thickness, and pseudophakia were not significantly correlated with RNFLT. The regression model revealed a significant relationship between RNFLT and age in decades (p&amp;lt;0.02), spherical equivalent (p&amp;lt;0.0001), axial length (p&amp;lt;0.0001), glaucoma (p&amp;lt;0.0001), tinnitus (p = 0.04), apnoea (p = 0.047), homocysteine (p = 0.05) and alcohol intake &gt;10g/d for women and &gt;20g/d for men (p = 0.02). Glaucoma, apnoea, higher homocysteine, higher alcohol intake and higher axial length as well as age were related to decreased RNFLT while higher spherical equivalent or history for tinnitus were related to thicker RNFL.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;RNFLT is related to age, ocular parameters and lifestyle factors. Considering these parameters in normative databases could improve the evaluation of peripapillary RNFLT. It is necessary to evaluate if a reduction of alcohol intake as well as the therapy of apnea or high homocysteine levels could positively influence RNFLT.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197682</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Association of ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric and lifestyle parameters with retinal nerve fibre layer thickness</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Julia Lamparter, Irene Schmidtmann, Alexander K.

Calcium is an important second messenger in plants that is released into the cytosol early after recognition of various environmental stimuli. Decoding of such calcium signals by calcium sensors is the key for the plant to react appropriately to each stimulus. Several members of Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) act as calcium sensors and some are known to mediate both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we study the role of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; CML9 in different stress responses. CML9 was reported earlier as defense regulator against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast to salicylic acid-mediated defense against biotrophic pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;syringae&lt;/i&gt;, defenses against herbivores and necrotrophic fungi are mediated by jasmonates. We demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; is induced upon wounding and feeding of the insect herbivore &lt;i&gt;Spodoptera littoralis&lt;/i&gt;. However, neither different &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function mutant lines nor overexpression lines were impaired upon insect feeding. No difference in herbivore-induced phytohormone elevation was detected in &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; lines. The defense against the spider mite &lt;i&gt;Tetranychus urticae&lt;/i&gt; was also unaffected. In addition, &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; mutant lines showed a wild type-like reaction to the necrotrophic fungus &lt;i&gt;Alternaria brassicicola&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our data suggest that CML9 might be a regulator involved only in the defense against biotrophic pathogens, independent of jasmonates. In addition, our data challenge the involvement of CML9 in plant drought stress response. Taken together, we suggest that CML9 is a specialized rather than a general regulator of stress responses in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197633</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Herbivory-responsive calmodulin-like protein CML9 does not guide jasmonate-mediated defenses in &amp;lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Monika Heyer, Sandra S.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the thickness of retinal layers and association with final visual acuity using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in macular area of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients after a successful macular re-attachment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In retrospective study, a total 24 eyes with macula-off RRD were enrolled. All patients underwent vitrectomy to repair RRD. Outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptor layer (PR), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thicknesses were measured by the Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) SD-OCT with automated segmentation software. The relationship between the thicknesses of each retinal layer and postoperative logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution scale (LogMAR) visual acuity was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;OPL and RPE thicknesses were not significantly different between the retinal detachment eyes and fellow eyes (P = 0.839, 0.999, respectively). The ONL and photoreceptor thickness were significantly thinner in the retinal detachment eyes (P &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.001, respectively). In the univariate regression analysis, preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ONL thickness and photoreceptor thickness showed association with the postoperative BCVA (P = 0.003, &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.024, respectively). In final multiple linear regression model, ONL thickness was the only variable significantly associated with postoperative BCVA (P = 0.044).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Segmented ONL and photoreceptor thickness of retinal detachment eyes were significantly thinner than fellow eyes.

Several studies have reported regulatory effects of estrogens on fear conditioning in female rodents. However, these studies used different doses, durations, and/or administration methods, and reported inconsistent results. To clarify the effect of estrogen on fear conditioning, we investigated the effects of different doses and durations of estradiol administration on freezing behavior during contextual fear conditioning in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In Experiment 1, OVX ICR mice received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of either oil vehicle (control, 0.1 ml sesame oil) or varied doses (0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, or 50 μg/0.1 ml) of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB). Fear conditioning was conducted two days post-EB treatment, and the mice were tested for the learned fear response the following day. In Experiment 2, OVX female mice received an s.c. implantation of a Silastic capsule (I.D. 1.98 × 20.0 mm) containing either vehicle or varied doses (0.05 μg/0.1 ml, 0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, 50 μg/0.1 ml) of EB. Two weeks after implantation, fear conditioning was conducted. During the tests conducted 24 h after conditioning, the high dose EB group showed longer freezing times in both experiments, and lower locomotor activity compared to the control or lower dose groups. In Experiment 3, serum estradiol concentrations of the mice that were treated like those in Experiment 2, were measured; the serum levels of estradiol increased linearly according to the dose of EB administered. The results suggest that mice treated with a high dose of EB exhibit enhanced fear learning, regardless of treatment duration. As a woman’s vulnerability to emotional disorders increases in the peripregnancy period, during which estrogen levels are high, the results from the high-dose EB groups may be important for understanding the hormonal mechanisms involved in these disorders.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197441</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The enhancement effect of estradiol on contextual fear conditioning in female mice</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yui K.

Surface waters are important sources of water for drinking, industrial, agricultural, and recreational uses; hence, contamination of water by fecal, pathogenic, or antimicrobial resistant (AR) bacteria is a major environmental and public health concern. However, very little data is available on prevalence of these bacteria in surface water throughout a watershed. This study aimed to characterize &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; present in the Upper Oconee Watershed, a mixed-use watershed in Athens, GA, USA for potential pathogenicity and AR. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; were enumerated by colony counts, cultured by enrichment and direct plating, and characterized by phylo-groups, diarrheagenic pathotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibility. From the analysis, 99.3% (455/458) of the total samples were positive for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; resulting in 496 isolates. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; counts were as high as 1.2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU/100 ml, which is above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) threshold for recreational water (235 CFU/100 ml based on a one-time measurement). Phylo-groups B2 (31.7%; 157/496) and B1 (30.8%; 153/496) were the most prevalent among the isolates. Enteropathogenic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (EPEC) (19/496) and Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) (1/496) were the only diarrheagenic pathotypes detected. AR was observed in 6.9% (34/496) of the isolates, 15 of which were multidrug resistant (MDR; resistance to two or more classes of antimicrobials). Tetracycline resistance was most often detected (76.5%; 26/34), followed by ampicillin (32.4%; 11/34), streptomycin (23.5%; 8/34), sulfisoxazole (23.5%; 8/34), and nalidixic acid (14.7%; 5/34). Results from this study showed that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; is prevalent in high levels in the Upper Oconee Watershed, suggesting possible widespread fecal contamination. The presence of pathogenic, AR &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; in the watershed indicates that environmental water can serve as a reservoir of resistant bacteria that may be transferred to humans through drinking and recreational activities.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197005</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Prevalence and characterization of &amp;lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; isolated from the Upper Oconee Watershed in Northeast Georgia</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sohyun Cho, Lari M.

From the analysis, 99.3% (455/458) of the total samples were positive for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; resulting in 496 isolates. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; counts were as high as 1.2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU/100 ml, which is above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) threshold for recreational water (235 CFU/100 ml based on a one-time measurement). Phylo-groups B2 (31.7%; 157/496) and B1 (30.8%; 153/496) were the most prevalent among the isolates. Enteropathogenic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (EPEC) (19/496) and Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) (1/496) were the only diarrheagenic pathotypes detected. AR was observed in 6.9% (34/496) of the isolates, 15 of which were multidrug resistant (MDR; resistance to two or more classes of antimicrobials). Tetracycline resistance was most often detected (76.5%; 26/34), followed by ampicillin (32.4%; 11/34), streptomycin (23.5%; 8/34), sulfisoxazole (23.5%; 8/34), and nalidixic acid (14.7%; 5/34). Results from this study showed that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; is prevalent in high levels in the Upper Oconee Watershed, suggesting possible widespread fecal contamination. The presence of pathogenic, AR &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; in the watershed indicates that environmental water can serve as a reservoir of resistant bacteria that may be transferred to humans through drinking and recreational activities.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Sohyun Cho</name></author><fingerprint>b2da7045</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197005</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197005</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4ee:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198174</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Claudia Mascia, Irene Pozzetto, Blerta Kertusha, Raffaella Marocco, Cosmo Del Borgo, Tiziana Tieghi, Serena Vita, Stefano Savinelli, Marco Iannetta, Vincenzo Vullo, Miriam Lichtner, Claudio Maria Mastroianni&lt;/p&gt;
Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Measles is an infectious disease that represents a serious public health problem worldwide, being associated with increased susceptibility to secondary infections, especially in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The aim of this study was to evaluate sCD163 and sCD14 levels in measles virus (MV) infected patients, as markers of immune activation, in order to better understand their role in the pathogenesis of the disease. TNF-α plasma levels were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;sCD163, sCD14 and TNF-α were measured by ELISA in plasma samples of 27 MV infected patients and 27 healthy donors (HD) included as controls.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At the time of hospital admission, sCD163 and sCD14 levels were significantly higher in MV infected patients than in HD, while a decrease in TNF-α levels were found even if without statistical significance. sCD163 and sCD14 levels were significantly decreased after two months from acute infection compared to hospital admission although they remained significantly higher compared to HD. TNF-α levels increased significantly during the follow-up period. Considering clinical parameters, sCD163 levels positively correlated with aspartate aminotransferase, white blood cell count and neutrophils rate, while negatively correlated with the lymphocyte percentage. sCD14 levels positively correlated with the neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results indicate that, despite the resolution of symptoms, an important macrophage/monocyte activation persists in measles patients, even after two months from infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198174</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Persistent high plasma levels of sCD163 and sCD14 in adult patients with measles virus infection</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Claudia Mascia, Irene Pozzetto, Blerta Kertusha, Raffaella Marocco, Cosmo Del Borgo, Tiziana Tieghi, Serena Vita, Stefano Savinelli, Marco Iannetta, Vincenzo Vullo, Miriam Lichtner, Claudio Maria Mastroianni&lt;/p&gt;

Two-pore domain K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt;) are responsible for background K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents and regulate the resting membrane potential and cellular excitability.

Overall, this analysis reveals important information about the birth order of specific cells, key building blocks of global connectivity, and how these structures corresponds to various embryogenetic stages during the emergence of a connectome.</content></content><title>The Emergent Connectome in Caenorhabditis elegans Embryogenesis [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>DevoWorm Group,</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/30/146035</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/146035v3?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce928:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/eaar3824?rss=1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;Hülsmann and Hartig suggest that ecological mechanisms other than specialized natural enemies or intraspecific competition contribute to our estimates of conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD).

Wild bees are essential pollinators whose survival partly depends on the capacity of their environment to offer a sufficient amount of nectar and pollen. Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a generalist mining bee, &lt;i&gt;Andrena cineraria&lt;/i&gt;, that forages and reproduces during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; was explained by the interaction between flower density in the grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators. Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed rape resources.</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197684</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Current and previous spatial distributions of oilseed rape fields influence the abundance and the body size of a solitary wild bee, &amp;lt;i&gt;Andrena cineraria&amp;lt;/i&gt;, in permanent grasslands</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Colin Van Reeth, Gaël Caro, Christian Bockstaller, Nadia Michel&lt;/p&gt;

Due to the rarity of the mutant events, rare variants are routinely analyzed on an aggregate level. While aggregation analyses improve the detection of global-level signal, they are not able to pinpoint causal variants within a variant set. To perform inference on a localized level, additional information, e.g., biological annotation, is often needed to boost the information content of a rare variant. Following the observation that important variants are likely to cluster together on functional domains, we propose a protein structure guided local test (POINT) to provide variant-specific association information using structure-guided aggregation of signal.

Due to the rarity of the mutant events, rare variants are routinely analyzed on an aggregate level. While aggregation analyses improve the detection of global-level signal, they are not able to pinpoint causal variants within a variant set. To perform inference on a localized level, additional information, e.g., biological annotation, is often needed to boost the information content of a rare variant. Following the observation that important variants are likely to cluster together on functional domains, we propose a protein structure guided local test (POINT) to provide variant-specific association information using structure-guided aggregation of signal. Constructed under a kernel machine framework, POINT performs local association testing by borrowing information from neighboring variants in the 3-dimensional protein space in a data-adaptive fashion. Besides merely providing a list of promising variants, POINT assigns each variant a p-value to permit variant ranking and prioritization. We assess the selection performance of POINT using simulations and illustrate how it can be used to prioritize individual rare variants in PCSK9 associated with low-density lipoprotein in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial data.</content></content><title>Identifying individual risk rare variants using protein structure-guided local tests (POINT) [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Marceau West, R.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/29/333245</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333245v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122b:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197496</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alba Estrada, Raimundo Real&lt;/p&gt;
The evaluation of protected area networks on their capacity to preserve species distributions is a key topic in conservation biology. There are different types of protected areas, with National Parks those with highest level of protection. National Parks can be declared attending to many ecological features that include the presence of certain animal species. Here, we selected 37 vertebrate species that were highlighted as having relevant natural value for at least one of the 10 National Parks of mainland Spain. We modelled species distributions with the favourability function, and applied the Insecurity Index to detect the degree of protection of favourable areas for each species. Two metrics of Insecurity Index were defined for each species: the Insecurity Index in each of the cells, and the Overall Insecurity Index of a species. The former allows the identification of insecure areas for each species that can be used to establish spatial conservation priorities. The latter gives a value of Insecurity for each species, which we used to calculate the Representativeness of favourable areas for the species in the network. As expected, due to the limited extension of the National Park network, all species have high values of Insecurity; i.e., just a narrow proportion of their favourable areas are covered by a National Park. However, the majority of species favourable areas are well represented in the network, i.e., the percentage of favourable areas covered by the National Park network is higher than the percentage of mainland Spain covered by the network (result also supported by a randomization approach). Even if a reserve network only covers a low percentage of a country, the Overall Insecurity Index allows an objective assessment of its capacity to represent species. Beyond the results presented here, the Insecurity Index has the potential to be extrapolated to other areas and to cover a wide range of species.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197496</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Assessment of the National Park network of mainland Spain by the Insecurity Index of vertebrate species</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alba Estrada, Raimundo Real&lt;/p&gt;

The mammalian secretoglobin (SCGB) superfamily contains functionally diverse members, among which the major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse salivary androgen-binding protein (ABP) display similar subunits. We searched for molecular similarities between Fel d 1 and ABP to examine the possibility that they play similar roles. We aimed to i) cluster the evolutionary relationships of the SCGB superfamily; ii) identify divergence patterns, structural overlap, and protein-protein docking between Fel d 1 and ABP dimers; and iii) explore the residual interaction between ABP dimers and steroid binding in chemical communication using computational approaches. We also report that the evolutionary tree of the SCGB superfamily comprises seven unique palm-like clusters, showing the evolutionary pattern and divergence time tree of Fel d 1 with 28 ABP paralogs. Three ABP subunits (A27, BG27, and BG26) share phylogenetic relationships with Fel d 1 chains. The Fel d 1 and ABP subunits show similarities in terms of sequence conservation, identical motifs and binding site clefts. Topologically equivalent positions were visualized through superimposition of ABP A27:BG27 (AB) and ABP A27:BG26 (AG) dimers on a heterodimeric Fel d 1 model. In docking, Fel d 1-ABP dimers exhibit the maximum surface binding ability of AG compared with that of AB dimers and the several polar interactions between ABP dimers with steroids. Hence, cat Fel d 1 is an ABP-like molecule in which monomeric chains 1 and 2 are the equivalent of the ABPA and ABPBG monomers, respectively. These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding.</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Another cat and mouse game: Deciphering the evolution of the SCGB superfamily and exploring the molecular similarity of major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse ABP using computational approaches</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rajesh Durairaj, Patrick Pageat, Cécile Bienboire-Frosini&lt;/p&gt;

These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding.</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Rajesh Durairaj</name></author><fingerprint>a534a1f8</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84555:7cfe07d6</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198442</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jesper Edvardsson Rasmussen, Göran Laurell, Helge Rask-Andersen, Jonas Bergquist, Per Olof Eriksson&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Due to the surrounding bone, the human inner ear is relatively inaccessible and difficult to reach for cellular and molecular analyses. However, these types of investigations are needed to better understand the etiology, pathophysiology and progression of several inner ear disorders. Moreover, the fluid from the inner ear cannot be sampled for micro-chemical analyses from healthy individuals &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, in the present paper, we studied patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) undergoing trans-labyrinthine surgery (TLS). Our primary aim was to identify perilymph proteins in patients with VS on an individual level. Our second aim was to investigate the proteins identified at a functional level and our final aim was to search for biological markers for tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Sixteen patients underwent TLS for sporadic VS. Perilymph was aspirated through the round window before opening the labyrinth. One sample was contaminated and excluded resulting in 15 usable samples. Perilymph samples were analyzed with an online tandem LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Data were analyzed with MaxQuant software to identify the total number of proteins and to quantify proteins in individual samples. Protein function was analyzed using the PANTHER Overrepresentation tool. Associations between perilymph protein content, clinical parameters, tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter were assessed using Random Forest and Boruta. In total, 314 proteins were identified; 60 in all 15 patients and 130 proteins only once in 15 patients. Ninety-one proteins were detected in at least 12 out of 15 patients. Random Forest followed by Boruta analysis confirmed that alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (P02765) was an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss. In addition, functional analysis showed that numerous processes were significantly increased in the perilymph. The top three enriched biological processes were: 1) secondary metabolic processes; 2) complement activation and 3) cell recognition.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The proteome of perilymph in patients with vestibular schwannoma has an inter-individual stable section. However, even in a cohort with homogenous disease, the variation between individuals represented the majority of the detected proteins. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, P02765, was shown to be an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss, a finding that needs to be verified in other studies. In pathway analysis perilymph had highly enriched functions, particularly in terms of increased immune and metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198442</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The proteome of perilymph in patients with vestibular schwannoma.

Interventions to enhance mental health and well-being within high risk industries such as the emergency services have typically focused on individual-level factors, though there is increasing interest in the role of organisational-level interventions. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of different aspects of manager support in determining the mental health of ambulance personnel. A cross-sectional survey was completed by ambulance personnel across two Australian states (N = 1,622). Demographics, manager support and mental health measures were assessed. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to determine the explanatory influence of the employee’s perception of the priority management places upon mental health issues (manager psychosocial safety climate) and managers’ observed behaviours (manager behaviour) on employee common mental disorder and well-being within ambulance personnel. Of the 1,622 participants, 123 (7.6%) were found to be suffering from a likely mental disorder. Manager psychosocial safety climate accounted for a significant amount of the variance in levels of employee common mental health disorder symptoms (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01). Manager behaviour had a lesser, but still statistically significant influence upon symptoms of common mental disorder (7% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (10% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.05). The perceived importance management places on mental health and managers’ actual behaviour are related but distinct concepts, and each appears to impact employee mental health. While the overall variance explained by each factor was limited, the fact that each is potentially modifiable makes this finding important and highlights the significance of organisational and team-level interventions to promote employee well-being within emergency services and other high-risk occupations.</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197802</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The importance of manager support for the mental health and well-being of ambulance personnel</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine Petrie, Aimée Gayed, Bridget T.

Arbuscular Mycorrhiza and Root Nodule Symbiosis are symbiotic interactions with a high benefit for plant growth and crop production. Thus, it is of great interest to understand the developmental process of these symbioses in detail. We analysed very early symbiotic responses of &lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula&lt;/i&gt; root hair cells, by stimulation with lipochitinoligosaccharides specific for the induction of nodules (Nod-LCOs), or the interaction with mycorrhiza (Myc-LCOs). Intracellular micro electrodes were used, in combination with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensitive reporter dyes, to study the relations between cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and membrane potential changes. We found that sulfated Myc- as well as Nod-LCOs initiate a membrane depolarization, which depends on the chemical composition of these signaling molecules, as well as the genotype of the plants that were studied. A successive application of sulfated Myc-LCOs and Nod-LCOs resulted only in a single transient depolarization, indicating that Myc-LCOs can repress plasma membrane responses to Nod-LCOs. In contrast to current models, the Nod-LCO-induced depolarization precedes changes in the cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; level of root hair cells. The Nod-LCO induced membrane depolarization thus is most likely independent of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and nuclear Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spiking.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198126</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Mycorrhizal lipochitinoligosaccharides (LCOs) depolarize root hairs of &amp;lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anna-Lena Hürter, Sébastien Fort, Sylvain Cottaz, Rainer Hedrich, Dietmar Geiger, M.

This fluorination method is synthetically valuable considering the scarcity of alternative protocols and points the way to wider application of the catalytic approach with diverse anionic nucleophiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Asymmetric nucleophilic fluorination under hydrogen bonding phase-transfer catalysis</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Pupo, G., Ibba, F., Ascough, D.

Background &lt;p&gt;The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to considerable concerns about the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR). Sexual contact, particularly men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most prevalent form of HIV transmission in Shijiazhuang. Hence, we conducted an epidemiological surveillance study on TDR among newly diagnosed individuals who infected-HIV through sexual contact in from 2014–2015.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Genotypic resistance mutations were defined using the WHO-2009 surveillance list. Potential impact on antiretroviral drug was predicted according to the Stanford HIV db program version 7.0. The role of transmission clusters in drug resistant strains was evaluated by phylogenetic and network analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In this study, 589 individuals were recruited and 542 samples were amplified and sequenced successfully. The over prevalence of TDR was 6.1%: 1.8% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 2.0% to non- NRTIs (NNRTIs) and 2.4% to protease inhibitors (PIs), respectively. We did not find significant differences in the TDR prevalence by demographic and clinical characteristics (p &gt; 0.05). Using network and phylogenetic analysis, almost 60.0% sequences were clustered together. Of these clusters, 2 included at least two individuals carrying the same resistance mutation, accounting for 21.2% (7/33) individuals with TDR. No significant difference was observed in the clustering rate between the individuals with and without TDR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We obtained a moderate level TDR rate in studied region. These findings enhance our understanding of HIV-1 drug resistance prevalence in Shijiazhuang, and may be helpful for the comprehensive prevention and control of HIV-1.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Epidemiological surveillance of HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance among newly diagnosed individuals in Shijiazhuang, northern China, 2014–2015</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xianfeng Wang, Xiaosong Liu, Feng Li, Hong Zhou, Jiefang Li, Yingying Wang, Lihua Liu, Shujun Liu, Yi Feng, Ning Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Ongoing acidification of the ocean through uptake of anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is known to affect marine biota and ecosystems with largely unknown consequences for marine food webs. Changes in food web structure have the potential to alter trophic transfer, partitioning, and biogeochemical cycling of elements in the ocean. Here we investigated the impact of realistic end-of-the-century CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations on the development and partitioning of the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica pools in a coastal pelagic ecosystem (Gullmar Fjord, Sweden). We covered the entire winter-to-summer plankton succession (100 days) in two sets of five pelagic mesocosms, with one set being CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enriched (~760 μatm &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the other one left at ambient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. Elemental mass balances were calculated and we highlight important challenges and uncertainties we have faced in the closed mesocosm system. Our key observations under high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were: (1) A significantly amplified transfer of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from primary producers to higher trophic levels, during times of regenerated primary production. (2) A prolonged retention of all three elements in the pelagic food web that significantly reduced nitrogen and phosphorus sedimentation by about 11 and 9%, respectively. (3) A positive trend in carbon fixation (relative to nitrogen) that appeared in the particulate matter pool as well as the downward particle flux. This excess carbon counteracted a potential reduction in carbon sedimentation that could have been expected from patterns of nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes. Our findings highlight the potential for ocean acidification to alter partitioning and cycling of carbon and nutrients in the surface ocean but also show that impacts are temporarily variable and likely depending upon the structure of the plankton food web.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197502</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Enhanced transfer of organic matter to higher trophic levels caused by ocean acidification and its implications for export production: A mass balance approach</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tim Boxhammer, Jan Taucher, Lennart T.

With high numbers of refugees arriving in Europe uncertainty exists as to whether multidrug-resistant organisms are imported into the healthcare system. In our study, we identified 383 refugee-inpatients admitted to the University Hospital Münster, Germany between September 2015 and September 2016. For this patient cohort screening for Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) was recommended in our institution. Until May 2016 pre-emptive isolation was applied to all refugee-inpatients until the exclusion of these multidrug-resistant organisms. MRSA were found in 34 refugee-patients (9.8%), MDR-GNB in 25 refugee-patients (12.9%) and VRE in none of the refugee patients. We did not find any strains carrying carbapenemases. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data demonstrated that the respective isolates were genetically heterogeneous and revealed no transmission of refugee-patient isolates to other patients. We therefore omitted pre-emptive isolation as an infection control measure for this group of patients.

With high numbers of refugees arriving in Europe uncertainty exists as to whether multidrug-resistant organisms are imported into the healthcare system. In our study, we identified 383 refugee-inpatients admitted to the University Hospital Münster, Germany between September 2015 and September 2016. For this patient cohort screening for Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) was recommended in our institution. Until May 2016 pre-emptive isolation was applied to all refugee-inpatients until the exclusion of these multidrug-resistant organisms. MRSA were found in 34 refugee-patients (9.8%), MDR-GNB in 25 refugee-patients (12.9%) and VRE in none of the refugee patients. We did not find any strains carrying carbapenemases. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data demonstrated that the respective isolates were genetically heterogeneous and revealed no transmission of refugee-patient isolates to other patients. We therefore omitted pre-emptive isolation as an infection control measure for this group of patients. Furthermore, molecular typing did not show evidence for nosocomial transmission from refugee-patients to other patients. Standard hygiene measures successfully prevented the transmission of refugee-patient isolates to other patients and as a result introduction into the healthcare system. This underlines that any multidrug-resistant organisms present within this cohort are not of any extraordinary concern for health systems.</content></content><updated>1527800400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Annelene Kossow</name></author><fingerprint>64e3193c</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198103</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198103</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1528220492204</crawled><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_163d10a21ac:5714deb:2835af05</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5884.short?rss=1</originId><description>Sterols are essential eukaryotic lipids that are required for a variety of physiological roles.

Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess whether the prevalence estimates for physical and cognitive doping differed significantly between &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3. The order of questions (physical doping and cognitive doping) as well as the probability of receiving the sensitive question (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3) were counterbalanced across participants. Statistical power analyses were performed to determine sample size.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence estimate for physical doping with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 was 22.5% (95% CI: 10.8–34.1), and 12.8% (95% CI: 7.6–18.0) with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Epiretinal traction is not responsible only for epiretinal but also intraretinal changes. This study aims to describe structural and vascular intraretinal changes after macular peeling in idiopathic (iERM) vs diabetic ERM (dERM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective interventional study on forty-two eyes, 23 with iERMs and 19 with dERMs, undergoing ERM-ILM peeling. We performed SD-OCT preoperatively, 1 and 6 months postoperatively to assess central macular thickness (CMT), intraretinal cysts (IC) and/or continuous ectopic inner foveal layers (CEIFL), superficial and deep capillary free zone (CFZ) area on OCT-A. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as a Müller cells marker, was detected immunohistochemically on ILM specimens, to assess Müller cells iatrogenic damage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The CEIFLs were significantly more common in iERMs (12 (52.2%) in iERMs vs 2 (10.5%) in dERMs, p = 0.004), whereas ICs in dERMs (6 (26.1%) in iERMs vs 17 (89.5%) in dERMs, p&amp;lt;0.001). Median preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/50 [20/40-20/66] and 20/33 [20/25-20/40] in iERMs and 20/100 [20/66-20/200] and 20/50 [20/50-20/66] in dERMs, respectively. Median preoperative and postoperative CMT was 423 [370–488] and 364 [329–382] μm in iERM group and 465 [447–503] and 378 [359–433] μm in dERM group, respectively. The BCVA improvement and reduction of CMT thickness were significant in both groups (p&amp;lt;0.001). The presence of CEIFL was associated with lower BCVA in iERMs. Deep CFZ network significantly increased only in dERMs, passing from 0.34 [0.29–0.42] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; preoperatively to 0.56 [0.46–0.6] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 6-month follow-up (p&amp;lt;0.001).

Objective &lt;p&gt;We investigated the characteristics of pediatric emergency department (ED) patients in Korea and determined factors associated with hospital admission after ED treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Korea Health Panel data from 2008 through 2013 were analyzed retrospectively; we included patients under 18 years old who visited the ED at least once. We collected patient and household epidemiologic data such as sex, age group, region of residence, disability, chronic disease, household income quintile, national health insurance type, use of private insurance, and annual frequency of ED visits. We also examined data related to each ED visit, such as reason for visit, medical service provided, and hospital size/ownership. We then investigated which factors were correlated with case disposition (discharge home or hospital admission) after ED treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 3,160 pediatric ED visits occurred during the six-year period. Males (57.5%) and children aged 0–5 years (47.7%) made more visits than females and older children, respectively. The proportion of ED visits for disease (67.7%) was much higher than for injury or poisoning (32.2%), and 452 cases (14.3%) required hospital admission. For hospital admission, the odds ratio (OR) of females was 0.73 compared to males, and the OR of children aged 6–11 was 0.68 compared to children aged 0–5.

Recently, however, an L-glucose catabolic pathway has been discovered in &lt;i&gt;Paracoccus laeviglucosivorans&lt;/i&gt;, and the genes responsible cloned. &lt;i&gt;Scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase is involved in the first step in the pathway that oxidizes L-glucose to produce L-glucono-1,5-lactone with concomitant reduction of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dependent manner. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex of &lt;i&gt;scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and L-glucono-1,5-lactone at 1.8 Å resolution. The enzyme adopts a homo-tetrameric structure, similar to those of the inositol dehydrogenase family, and the electron densities of the bound sugar was clearly observed, allowing identification of the residues responsible for interaction with the substrate in the catalytic site. In addition to the conserved catalytic residues (Lys106, Asp191, and His195), another residue, His318, located in the loop region of the adjacent subunit, is involved in substrate recognition. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of these residues in catalytic activity. We also report the complex structures of the enzyme with &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol and &lt;i&gt;scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inosose. The Arg178 residue located in the flexible loop at the entrance of the catalytic site is also involved in substrate recognition, and plays an important role in accepting both L-glucose and inositols as substrates. On the basis of these structural features, which have not been identified in the known inositol dehydrogenases, and a phylogenetic analysis of IDH family enzymes, we suggest a novel subfamily of the GFO/IDH/MocA family. Since many enzymes in this family have not biochemically characterized, our results could promote to find their activities with various substrates.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198010</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Structural basis of L-glucose oxidation by &amp;lt;i&gt;scyllo&amp;lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase: Implications for a novel enzyme subfamily classification</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kazuhiro Fukano, Kunio Ozawa, Masaya Kokubu, Tetsu Shimizu, Shinsaku Ito, Yasuyuki Sasaki, Akira Nakamura, Shunsuke Yajima&lt;/p&gt;

Choosing valuable objects and rewarding actions is critical for survival. While such choices must be made in a way that suits the animal’s circumstances, the neural mechanisms underlying such context-appropriate behavior are unclear. To address this question, we devised a context-dependent reward-seeking task for macaque monkeys. Each trial started with the appearance of one of many visual scenes containing two or more objects, and the monkey had to choose the good object by saccade to get a reward. These scenes were categorized into two dimensions of emotional context: dangerous versus safe and rich versus poor. We found that many amygdala neurons were more strongly activated by dangerous scenes, by rich scenes, or by both. Furthermore, saccades to target objects occurred more quickly in dangerous than in safe scenes and were also quicker in rich than in poor scenes. Thus, amygdala neuronal activity and saccadic reaction times were negatively correlated in each monkey. These results suggest that amygdala neurons facilitate targeting saccades predictably based on aspects of emotional context, as is necessary for goal-directed and social behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/UixC9bfw7t8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1528232400000</published><fingerprint>74b263e4</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005339</link><title>Amygdala activity for the modulation of goal-directed behavior in emotional contexts</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kazutaka Maeda, Jun Kunimatsu, Okihide Hikosaka&lt;/p&gt;

We use as a case study gene Transcription Start Sites (TSS) and show that a model trained on one organism (e.g. human) can be used to predict TSS in a different species (e.g. mouse).</content></content><title>Genome Functional Annotation using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Khodabandelou, G.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/30/330308</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/330308v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915f:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197309</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Róbert Adrian Rill, Kinga Bettina Faragó, András Lőrincz&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197309</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: Strategic predictors of performance in a divided attention task</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Róbert Adrian Rill, Kinga Bettina Faragó, András Lőrincz&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Róbert Adrian Rill</name></author><fingerprint>3727df65</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197309</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197309</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527239840082</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16396969152:286e4c:7cfe07d6</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26391-8</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rapid &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;

Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in Ontario, Canada. We describe the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of LD in Ontario and examine trends in the incidence of non-disseminated and disseminated LD. LD surveillance data from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) from 2005–2014 were mapped to symptoms according to syndrome groups (erythema migrans (EM), flu-like, cardiac, neurologic or arthritic) and disease stages (early localized, early disseminated or late disseminated). During the study period, 1,230 cases due to &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdoferi&lt;/i&gt; were reported in Ontario with annual incidence rates ranging from 0.32 (2006) to 2.16 (2013) cases per 100,000 population. Seventy percent of cases had EM and the proportion of cases with EM increased over time. Other clinical manifestations included flu-like (75%), arthritic (42%), neurologic (41%) and cardiac (6%) symptoms. Early localized disease (n = 415) manifested with EM (87%) and flu-like (57%) symptoms; early disseminated disease (n = 216) manifested with neurologic (94%), cardiac (10%) and EM (63%) symptoms; and late disseminated disease (n = 475) manifested with EM (62%), neurologic (55%), cardiac (9%), and arthritic symptoms (i.e., arthralgia (93%) and arthritis (7%)). Early localized and early disseminated cases (88% each) occurred primarily from May through September, compared to late disseminated cases (81%). The proportion of cases reported to public health within 30 days of illness onset increased during the study period, while the proportion of cases reported within 1–3 months and &gt;3 months decreased. Geographical variations characterized by higher incidence of early localized disease and earlier public health notification (within 30 days of illness onset) occurred in regions with established or recently established LD risk areas, while later public health notification (&gt;3 months after illness onset) was reported more frequently in regions with recently established or no identified risk areas. This is the first study to describe the clinical manifestations of LD in Ontario, Canada. The observed geographical variations in the epidemiology of LD in Ontario reinforce the need for regionally focused public health strategies aimed at increasing awareness, promoting earlier recognition and reporting, and encouraging greater uptake of preventive measures.</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198509</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Clinical manifestations of reported Lyme disease cases in Ontario, Canada: 2005–2014</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Karen O.

The transcriptional network and protein regulators that govern T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation have been studied extensively using advanced genomic approaches. For a better understanding of these biological processes, we have moved a step forward, from gene- to protein-level characterization of Th17 cells. Mass spectrometry–based label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics analysis were made of in vitro differentiated murine Th17 and induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells. More than 4,000 proteins, covering almost all subcellular compartments, were detected. Quantitative comparison of the protein expression profiles resulted in the identification of proteins specifically expressed in the Th17 and iTreg cells. Importantly, our combined analysis of proteome and gene expression data revealed protein expression changes that were not associated with changes at the transcriptional level. Our dataset provides a valuable resource, with new insights into the proteomic characteristics of Th17 and iTreg cells, which may prove useful in developing treatment of autoimmune diseases and developing tumor immunotherapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3TAHD3yxTS4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527800400000</published><fingerprint>e52d0514</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004194</link><title>Quantitative proteomic characterization and comparison of T helper 17 and induced regulatory T cells</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Imran Mohammad, Kari Nousiainen, Santosh D.

In clinical settings, the key to controlling spread of resistant strains is accurate and rapid detection. As traditional culture-based methods are time consuming, genetic approaches have recently been developed for this task. The diagnosis is typically made by measuring a few known determinants previously identified from whole genome sequencing, and thus is restricted to existing information on biological mechanisms. To overcome this limitation, we employed machine learning models to predict resistance to 11 compounds across four classes of antibiotics from existing and novel whole genome sequences of 1936 E. coli strains. We considered a range of methods, and examined population structure, isolation year, gene content, and polymorphism information as predictors. Gradient boosted decision trees consistently outperformed alternative models with an average F1 score of 0.88 on held-out data (range 0.66-0.96). While the best models most frequently employed all inputs, an average F1 score of 0.73 could be obtained using population structure information alone. Single nucleotide variation data were less useful, and failed to improve prediction for ten out of 11 antibiotics. These results demonstrate that antibiotic resistance in E. coli can be accurately predicted from whole genome sequences without a priori knowledge of mechanisms, and that both genomic and epidemiological data are informative. This paves way to integrating machine learning approaches into diagnostic tools in the clinic.</description><published>1528095600000</published><fingerprint>589aa0e1</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/338194v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The emergence of microbial antibiotic resistance is a global health threat.

These results demonstrate that antibiotic resistance in E. coli can be accurately predicted from whole genome sequences without a priori knowledge of mechanisms, and that both genomic and epidemiological data are informative. This paves way to integrating machine learning approaches into diagnostic tools in the clinic.</content></content><title>Precise prediction of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli from full genome sequences [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Moradigaravand, D.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/04/338194</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/338194v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>4</engagement><crawled>1527240227150</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163969c794e:29b963:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04473-5</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Absence of dynamic strain aging in an additively manufactured nickel-base superalloy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absence of dynamic strain aging in an additively manufactured nickel-base superalloy, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04473-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04473-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Detrimental serrated plastic flow via dynamic strain aging (DSA) in conventionally processed nickel superalloys usually occurs during high temperature deformation.

Ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome (BS) typically occur at rest and especially during sleep, suggesting that changes in the autonomic modulation may play an important role in arrhythmogenesis. The autonomic response to exercise and subsequent recovery was evaluated on 105 patients diagnosed with BS (twenty-four were symptomatic), by means of a time-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, so as to propose a novel predictive model capable of distinguishing symptomatic and asymptomatic BS populations. During incremental exercise, symptomatic patients showed higher &lt;i&gt;HF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;nu&lt;/sub&gt; values, probably related to an increased parasympathetic modulation, with respect to asymptomatic subjects. In addition, those extracted HRV features best distinguishing between populations were selected using a two-step feature selection approach, so as to build a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The final features subset included one third of the total amount of extracted autonomic markers, mostly acquired during incremental exercise and active recovery, thus evidencing the relevance of these test segments in BS patients classification. The derived predictive model showed an improved performance with respect to previous works in the field (&lt;i&gt;AUC&lt;/i&gt; = 0.92 ± 0.01; &lt;i&gt;Se&lt;/i&gt; = 0.91 ± 0.06; &lt;i&gt;Sp&lt;/i&gt; = 0.90 ± 0.05). Therefore, based on these findings, some of the analyzed HRV markers and the proposed model could be useful for risk stratification in Brugada syndrome.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197367</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Multivariate classification of Brugada syndrome patients based on autonomic response to exercise testing</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mireia Calvo, Daniel Romero, Virginie Le Rolle, Nathalie Béhar, Pedro Gomis, Philippe Mabo, Alfredo I.

Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Local dynamic stability during gait for predicting falls in elderly people: A one-year prospective study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lucia Bizovska, Zdenek Svoboda, Miroslav Janura, Maria Cristina Bisi, Nicolas Vuillerme&lt;/p&gt;

Previous studies investigating to what extent students in elementary schools defend their victimized classmates typically treated defending as an individual characteristic. Defending should, however, be seen as a directed dyadic relationship between a victim and a defender, who are embedded multiple positive and negative relationships with each other and their classmates. Accordingly, in the present study defending was investigated using social network analysis. More specifically, it was investigated to what extent defending relationships co-occurred with friendship and dislike relationships involving not only the victim and the defender but also other classmates. Bivariate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) were used to analyze the defending-friendship and defending-dislike relationships in seven grade-three classrooms. As hypothesized, the results indicated that victimized students were likely to be defended by students who they perceive as friends or who perceive them as friends. Moreover, defending was likely to occur when the victim and (potential) defender had the same friends. Victimized students were unlikely to be defended by classmates whom they disliked or who had indicated to dislike them. Finally, defending was likely to occur between students who disliked the same classmates.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194323</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Defending one&apos;s friends, not one&apos;s enemies: A social network analysis of children&apos;s defending, friendship, and dislike relationships using XPNet</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Beau Oldenburg, Marijtje Van Duijn, René Veenstra&lt;/p&gt;

Mouse models of breast cancer with specific molecular subtypes (e.g., ER or HER2 positive) in an immunocompetent or an immunocompromised environment significantly contribute to our understanding of cancer biology, despite some limitations, and they give insight into targeted therapies. However, an ideal triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse model is lacking. What has been missing in the TNBC mouse model is a sequential progression of the disease in an essential native microenvironment. This notion inspired us to develop a TNBC-model in syngeneic mice using a mammary intraductal (MIND) method. To achieve this goal, Mvt-1and 4T1 TNBC mouse cell lines were injected into the mammary ducts via nipples of FVB/N mice and BALB/c wild-type immunocompetent mice, respectively. We established that the TNBC-MIND model in syngeneic mice could epitomize all breast cancer progression stages and metastasis into the lungs via lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination within four weeks. Collectively, the syngeneic mouse-TNBC-MIND model may serve as a unique platform for further investigation of the underlying mechanisms of TNBC growth and therapies.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198143</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>MIND model for triple-negative breast cancer in syngeneic mice for quick and sequential progression analysis of lung metastasis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arnab Ghosh, Sandipto Sarkar, Snigdha Banerjee, Fariba Behbod, Ossama Tawfik, Douglas McGregor, Stephanie Graff, Sushanta K.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether stopping the effective antibiotic treatment following clinical improvement at Day 7 (Truncated treatment) would be non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 (Continued treatment) in patients with acute pyelonephritis (APN) requiring hospitalization treated with non-fluoroquinolone (non-FQ) antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Hospitalized adult men and non-pregnant women with culture-confirmed APN were eligible for participation after they had clinically improved following empirical or culture-guided treatment with intravenous non-FQ antibiotic(s). We excluded patients with severe sepsis, abscesses, prostatitis, recurrent or catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or urinary tract obstruction. We randomized eligible patients on Day 7 of effective treatment and assessed them at Weeks 1 and 6 after treatment completion. The primary outcome was retreatment for recurrent urinary tract infection. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 15%.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 17, 2015 and August 22, 2016, we randomly allocated 54 patients—27 patients in each arm. Twenty-four (44%) patients were male, and 26 (48%) had diabetes mellitus. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was the most common urinary isolate (47 [87%] patients); 36 (78%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In all, 41 (76%) patients received amikacin-based treatment. At the end of 6 weeks, no patient in the truncated treatment arm required retreatment, whereas 1 patient in the continued treatment arm was retreated. Difference (90% CI) in retreatment was −3.7% (−15.01% to 6.15%). Upper bound of the difference (6.15%) was below the prespecified limit, establishing non-inferiority of truncated treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria at Week 6 was similar between the two arms (3/24 vs. 3/26; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.0). Patients in the truncated treatment arm had significantly shorter hospital stay (8 [7–10] vs. 14 [14–15] days; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and less antibiotic consumption per patient (8.4 ± 2.8 vs. 17.4 ± 8.3 DDDs; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Stopping the effective non-FQ antibiotics following clinical improvement at Day 7 is non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 in selected patients with APN requiring hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;Clinical Trials Registry-India; CTRI/2016/04/006810.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197302</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Stopping the effective non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics at day 7 vs continuing until day 14 in adults with acute pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization: A randomized non-inferiority trial</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pavankumar Rudrabhatla, Surendran Deepanjali, Jharna Mandal, Rathinam Palamalai Swaminathan, Tamilarasu Kadhiravan&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Glucagon like-peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists diminish appetite and may contribute to the weight loss in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to determine, for the first time, the expression of GLP-1R by colon nerve fibres in patients with IBD, and functional effects of its agonists in cultured rat and human sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;GLP-1R and other nerve markers were studied by immunohistochemistry in colon biopsies from patients with IBD (n = 16) and controls (n = 8), human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissue, and in GLP-1R transfected HEK293 cells. The morphological effects of incretin hormones oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and glucagon were studied on neurite extension in cultured DRG neurons, and their functional effects on capsaicin and ATP signalling, using calcium imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significantly increased numbers of colonic mucosal nerve fibres were observed in IBD biopsies expressing GLP-1R (p = 0.0013), the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 (p = 0.0008), and sensory neuropeptide CGRP (p = 0.0014). An increase of GLP-1R positive nerve fibres in IBD colon was confirmed with a different antibody to GLP-1R (p = 0.016). GLP-1R immunostaining was intensely positive in small and medium-sized neurons in human DRG, and in human and rat DRG cultured neurons. Co-localization of GLP-1R expression with neuronal markers in colon and DRG confirmed the neural expression of GLP-1R, and antibody specificity was confirmed in HEK293 cells transfected with the GLP-1R. Treatment with oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and GLP-1 increased neurite length in cultured neurons compared with controls, but did not stimulate calcium influx directly, or affect capsaicin responses. However, exendin-4 significantly enhanced ATP responses in human DRG neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results show that increased GLP-1R innervation in IBD bowel could mediate enhanced visceral afferent signalling, and provide a peripheral target for therapeutic intervention. The differential effect of GLP-1R agonists on capsaicin and ATP responses in neurons suggest they may not affect pain mechanisms mediated by the capsaicin receptor TRPV1, but may enhance the effects of purinergic agonists.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198024</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) expression by nerve fibres in inflammatory bowel disease and functional effects in cultured neurons</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Uma Anand, Yiangos Yiangou, Ayesha Akbar, Tom Quick, Anthony MacQuillan, Mike Fox, Marco Sinisi, Yuri E.

The dopamine (DA) hypothesis of cognitive deficits suggests that too low or too high extracellular DA concentration in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) can severely impair the working memory (WM) maintenance during delay period. Thus, there exists only an optimal range of DA where the sustained-firing activity, the neural correlate of WM maintenance, in the cortex possesses optimal firing frequency as well as robustness against noisy distractions. Empirical evidences demonstrate changes even in the D1 receptor (D1R)-sensitivity to extracellular DA, collectively manifested through D1R density and DA-binding affinity, in the PFC under neuropsychiatric conditions such as ageing and schizophrenia. However, the impact of alterations in the cortical D1R-sensitivity on WM maintenance has yet remained poorly addressed. Using a quantitative neural mass model of the prefronto-mesoprefrontal system, the present study reveals that higher D1R-sensitivity may not only effectuate shrunk optimal DA range but also shift of the range to lower concentrations. Moreover, higher sensitivity may significantly reduce the WM-robustness even within the optimal DA range and exacerbates the decline at abnormal DA levels. These findings project important clinical implications, such as dosage precision and variability of DA-correcting drugs across patients, and failure in acquiring healthy WM maintenance even under drug-controlled normal cortical DA levels.</description><published>1527627600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Prefronto-cortical dopamine D1 receptor sensitivity can critically influence working memory maintenance during delayed response tasks</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Melissa Reneaux, Rahul Gupta&lt;/p&gt;

Monocyte-like cell lines (MCLCs), including THP-1, HL-60 and U-937 cells, are used routinely as surrogates for isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To systematically evaluate these immortalised cells and PBMCs as model systems to study inflammation relevant to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes and immuno-metabolism, we compared mRNA expression of inflammation-relevant genes, cell surface expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers, and chemotactic responses to inflammatory stimuli. Messenger RNA expression analysis suggested most genes were present at similar levels across all undifferentiated cells, though notably, &lt;i&gt;IDO1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes for indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and catabolises tryptophan to kynureninase (shown to be elevated in serum from diabetic patients), was not expressed in any PMA-treated MCLC, but present in GM-CSF-treated PBMCs. There was little overall difference in the pattern of expression of CD markers across all cells, though absolute expression levels varied considerably and the correlation between MCLCs and PBMCs was improved upon MCLC differentiation. Functionally, THP-1 and PBMCs migrated in response to chemoattractants in a transwell assay, with varying sensitivity to MCP-1, MIP-1α and LTB-4. However, despite similar gene and CD expression profiles, U-937 cells were functionally impaired as no migration was observed to any chemoattractant. Our analysis reveals that the MCLCs examined only partly replicate the genotypic and phenotypic properties of human PBMCs. To overcome such issues a universal differentiation protocol should be implemented for these cell lines, similar to those already used with isolated monocytes. Although not perfect, in our hands the THP-1 cells represent the closest, simplified surrogate model of PBMCs for study of inflammatory cell migration.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197177</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Comparative genotypic and phenotypic analysis of human peripheral blood monocytes and surrogate monocyte-like cell lines commonly used in metabolic disease research</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Darren M.

Spices and herbs are key dietary ingredients used across cultures worldwide. Beyond their use as flavoring and coloring agents, the popularity of these aromatic plant products in culinary preparations has been attributed to their antimicrobial properties. Last few decades have witnessed an exponential growth of biomedical literature investigating the impact of spices and herbs on health, presenting an opportunity to mine for patterns from empirical evidence. Systematic investigation of empirical evidence to enumerate the health consequences of culinary herbs and spices can provide valuable insights into their therapeutic utility. We implemented a text mining protocol to assess the health impact of spices by assimilating, both, their positive and negative effects. We conclude that spices show broad-spectrum benevolence across a range of disease categories in contrast to negative effects that are comparatively narrow-spectrum. We also implement a strategy for disease-specific culinary recommendations of spices based on their therapeutic tradeoff against adverse effects. Further by integrating spice-phytochemical-disease associations, we identify bioactive spice phytochemicals potentially involved in their therapeutic effects. Our study provides a systems perspective on health effects of culinary spices and herbs with applications for dietary recommendations as well as identification of phytochemicals potentially involved in underlying molecular mechanisms.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198030</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Data-driven analysis of biomedical literature suggests broad-spectrum benefits of culinary herbs and spices</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by N.

Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic disorder characterized by an immune-mediated reaction to gluten and a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Currently, the main treatment of CD is represented by adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which determines the resolution of symptoms, and the normalization of the serology and of the duodenal villous atrophy. In the present study, we aimed to identify changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of celiac patients on GFD for at least 2 years, in order to identify novel disease biomarkers and candidate targets for putative therapeutic approaches. Microarray analysis was performed on PBMCs from 17 celiac patients on long-term GFD and 20 healthy controls. We identified 517 annotated genes that were significantly modulated between celiac patients and controls. Significant biological pathways were functionally clustered using the Core Function of Ingenuity System Pathway Analysis (IPA). Intriguingly, despite being on a GFD, celiac patients exhibited a peculiar PBMC profile characterized by an aberrant expression of genes involved in the regulation of immunity, inflammatory response, metabolism, and cell proliferation. Random forest algorithm was then used to validate the prediction ability of core genes as classifiers of the “celiac status”. In conclusion, our study identified a characteristic PBMCs signature profile in clinically asymptomatic celiac patient.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197915</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Identification of peculiar gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of celiac patients on gluten free diet</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Moris Sangineto, Giusi Graziano, Simona D’Amore, Roberto Salvia, Giuseppe Palasciano, Carlo Sabbà, Michele Vacca, Marica Cariello&lt;/p&gt;

Niche construction theory states that not only does the environment act on populations to generate Darwinian selection, but organisms reciprocally modify the environment and the sources of natural selection. Cancer cells participate in niche construction as they alter their microenvironments and create pre-metastatic niches; in fact, metastasis is a product of niche construction. Here, we present a mathematical model of niche construction and metastasis. Our model contains producers, which pay a cost to contribute to niche construction that benefits all tumor cells, and cheaters, which reap the benefits without paying the cost. We derive expressions for the conditions necessary for metastasis, showing that the establishment of a mutant lineage that promotes metastasis depends on niche construction specificity and strength of interclonal competition. We identify a tension between the arrival and invasion of metastasis-promoting mutants, where tumors composed only of cheaters remain small but are susceptible to invasion whereas larger tumors containing producers may be unable to facilitate metastasis depending on the level of niche construction specificity. Our results indicate that even if metastatic subclones arise through mutation, metastasis may be hindered by interclonal competition, providing a potential explanation for recent surprising findings that most metastases are derived from early mutants in primary tumors.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198163</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Competition and niche construction in a model of cancer metastasis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jimmy J.

We found that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying these changes are functionally connected and jointly control genes involved in cell adhesion, a key process in epidermal maintenance. Using siRNA-based perturbation screens, we identified novel DNA/RNA binding regulators of epidermal differentiation. Computational modeling and experimental validation identified functional interactions between the matrin-type 2 zinc-finger protein ZMAT2 and the epigenetic modifiers ING5, SMARCA5, BRD1, UHRF1, BPTF, SMARCC2. ZMAT2 is required to keep cells in an undifferentiated, proliferative state and quantitative proteomics identified ZMAT2 as an interactor of the pre-spliceosome.

Brain stimulation can modulate the activity of neural circuits impaired by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), having promising clinical benefit. However, all individuals with the same condition currently receive identical brain stimulation, with limited theoretical basis for this generic approach. In this study, we introduce a control theory framework for obtaining exogenous signals that revert pathological electroencephalographic activity in AD at a minimal energetic cost, while reflecting patients’ biological variability. We used anatomical networks obtained from diffusion magnetic resonance images acquired by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) as mediators for the interaction between Duffing oscillators. The nonlinear nature of the brain dynamics is preserved, given that we extend the so-called state-dependent Riccati equation control to reflect the stimulation objective in the high-dimensional neural system. By considering nonlinearities in our model, we identified regions for which control inputs fail to correct abnormal activity. There are changes to the way stimulated regions are ranked in terms of the energetic cost of controlling the entire network, from a linear to a nonlinear approach. We also found that limbic system and basal ganglia structures constitute the top target locations for stimulation in AD. Patients with highly integrated anatomical networks–namely, networks having low average shortest path length, high global efficiency–are the most suitable candidates for the propagation of stimuli and consequent success on the control task. Other diseases associated with alterations in brain dynamics and the self-control mechanisms of the brain can be addressed through our framework.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O4eVK9xR6I0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527195600000</published><fingerprint>c5a09eda</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006136</link><title>Design of optimal nonlinear network controllers for Alzheimer&apos;s disease</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lazaro M.

Public transport (PT) is a key element in most major cities around the world. With the development of smartphones, available journey planning information is becoming an integral part of the PT system. Each traveler has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, and these preferences can also be reflected on the smartphone. This paper considers transit assignment in urban public-transport networks in which the passengers receive smartphone-based information containing elements that might influence the travel decisions in relation to line loads, as well as passenger benefits, and the paper discusses the transition from the current widespread choosing approach to a personalized decision-making approach based on smartphone information. The approach associated with smartphone guidance that considers passengers’ preference on travel time, waiting time and transfer is proposed in the process of obtaining his/her preferred route from the potential travel routes generated by the Deep First Search (DFS) method. Two other approaches, based on the scenarios reflecting reality, include passengers with access to no real time information, and passengers that only have access to the arrival time at the platform are used as comparisons. For illustration, the same network proposed by Spiess and Florian is utilized on the experiments in an agent-based model. Two experiments are conducted respectively according to whether each passenger’s choosing method is consistent. As expected, the results in the first experiment showed that the travel for consistent passengers with smartphone guidance was clearly shorter and that it can reduce travel time exceeding 15% and weighted cost exceeding 20%, and the average saved time approximated 3.88 minutes per passenger. The second experiment presented that travel cost, as well as cost savings, gradually decreased by employing smartphone guidance, and the maximum cost savings accounted for 14.2% of the total weighted cost.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197181</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Potential travel cost saving in urban public-transport networks using smartphone guidance</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cuiying Song, Wei Guan, Jihui Ma&lt;/p&gt;

Attempts to reduce this redundancy have focused on visualizing pathway overlap or merging pathways, but the resulting pathways may be of heterogeneous sizes and cover multiple biological functions. Efforts have also been made to deal with redundancy in pathway data by consolidating enriched pathways into a number of clusters or concepts. We present an alternative approach, which generates pathway subsets capable of covering all of genes presented within either pathway databases or enrichment results, generating substantial reductions in redundancy. Results: We propose a method that uses set cover to reduce pathway redundancy, without merging pathways. The proposed approach considers three objectives: removal of pathway redundancy, controlling pathway size and coverage of the gene set. By applying set cover to the ConsensusPathDB dataset we were able to produce a reduced set of pathways, representing 100% of the genes in the original data set with 74% less redundancy, or 95% of the genes with 88% less redundancy. We also developed an algorithm to simplify enrichment data and applied it to a set of enriched osteoarthritis pathways, revealing that within the top ten pathways, five were redundant subsets of more enriched pathways. Applying set cover to the enrichment results removed these redundant pathways allowing more informative pathways to take their place. Conclusion: Our method provides an alternative approach for handling pathway redundancy, while ensuring that the pathways are of homogeneous size and gene coverage is maximised. Pathways are not altered from their original form, allowing biological knowledge regarding the data set to be directly applicable. We demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to prioritise redundancy reduction, pathway size control or gene set coverage. The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.</description><published>1526022000000</published><fingerprint>4702538</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: The consolidation of pathway databases, such as KEGG[1], Reactome[2]and ConsensusPathDB[3], has generated widespread biological interest, however the issue of pathway redundancy impedes the use of these consolidated datasets.

Seller, Patrick H. O’Farrell&lt;/p&gt;
In preparation for dramatic morphogenetic events of gastrulation, rapid embryonic cell cycles slow at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; embryos, down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity initiates this slowing by delaying replication of heterochromatic satellite sequences and extending S phase.

In preparation for dramatic morphogenetic events of gastrulation, rapid embryonic cell cycles slow at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; embryos, down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity initiates this slowing by delaying replication of heterochromatic satellite sequences and extending S phase. We found that Cdk1 activity inhibited the chromatin association of Rap1 interacting factor 1 (Rif1), a candidate repressor of replication. Furthermore, Rif1 bound selectively to satellite sequences following Cdk1 down-regulation at the MBT. In the next S phase, Rif1 dissociated from different satellites in an orderly schedule that anticipated their replication. Rif1 lacking potential phosphorylation sites failed to dissociate and dominantly prevented completion of replication. Loss of Rif1 in mutant embryos shortened the post-MBT S phase and rescued embryonic cell cycles disrupted by depletion of the S phase–promoting kinase, cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7). Our work shows that Rif1 and S phase kinases compose a replication timer controlling first the developmental onset of late replication and then the precise schedule of replication within S phase. In addition, we describe how onset of late replication fits into the progressive maturation of heterochromatin during development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ajE-XA15ViE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><author><name>Charles A.

&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values represent a widely used, but pervasively misunderstood and fiercely contested method of scientific inference. Display items, such as figures and tables, often containing the main results, are an important source of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. We conducted a survey comparing the overall use of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and the occurrence of significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items of a sample of articles in the three top multidisciplinary journals (Nature, Science, PNAS) in 2017 and, respectively, in 1997. We also examined the reporting of multiplicity corrections and its potential influence on the proportion of statistically significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. Our findings demonstrated substantial and growing reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items, with increases of 2.5 to 14.5 times in 2017 compared to 1997. The overwhelming majority of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values (94%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 92% to 96%) were statistically significant. Methods to adjust for multiplicity were almost non-existent in 1997, but reported in many articles relying on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in 2017 (Nature 68%, Science 48%, PNAS 38%). In their absence, almost all reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant (98%, 95% CI 96% to 99%). Conversely, when any multiplicity corrections were described, 88% (95% CI 82% to 93%) of reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant. Use of Bayesian methods was scant (2.5%) and rarely (0.7%) articles relied exclusively on Bayesian statistics. Overall, wider appreciation of the need for multiplicity corrections is a welcome evolution, but the rapid growth of reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and implausibly high rates of reported statistical significance are worrisome.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197440</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;P&amp;lt;/i&gt; values in display items are ubiquitous and almost invariably significant: A survey of top science journals</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ioana Alina Cristea, John P.

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Factors associated with one-year mortality after recovery from critical illness are not well understood. Clinicians generally lack information regarding post-hospital discharge outcomes of patients from the intensive care unit, which may be important when counseling patients and families.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We sought to determine which factors among patients who survived for at least 30 days post-ICU admission are associated with one-year mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Single-center, longitudinal retrospective cohort study of all ICU patients admitted to a tertiary-care academic medical center from 2001–2012 who survived ≥30 days from ICU admission.

The primary outcome was one-year mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;32,420 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Among patients who survived to ≥30 days, 28,583 (88.2%) survived for greater than one year, whereas 3,837 (11.8%) did not. Variables associated with decreased one-year survival include: increased age, malignancy, number of hospital admissions within the prior year, duration of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive agent use, sepsis, history of congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the need for renal replacement therapy. Numerous effect modifications between these factors were found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Among survivors of critical illness, a significant number survive less than one year.

There is an urgent and unmet need for accurate biomarkers in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. A pharmaco-metabolomics study was conducted using plasma samples from the TRO19622 (olesoxime) trial to assess the link between early metabolomic profiles and clinical outcomes. Patients included in this trial were randomized into either Group O receiving olesoxime (n = 38) or Group P receiving placebo (n = 36). The metabolomic profile was assessed at time-point one (V1) and 12 months (V12) after the initiation of the treatment. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify 188 metabolites (Biocrates® commercial kit). Multivariate analysis based on machine learning approaches (i.e. Biosigner algorithm) was performed. Metabolomic profiles at V1 and V12 and changes in metabolomic profiles between V1 and V12 accurately discriminated between Groups O and P (p&amp;lt;5×10–6), and identified glycine, kynurenine and citrulline/arginine as the best predictors of group membership. Changes in metabolomic profiles were closely linked to clinical progression, and correlated with glutamine levels in Group P and amino acids, lipids and spermidine levels in Group O. Multivariate models accurately predicted disease progression and highlighted the discriminant role of sphingomyelins (SM C22:3, SM C24:1, SM OH C22:2, SM C16:1). To predict SVC from SM C24:1 in group O and SVC from SM OH C22:2 and SM C16:1 in group P+O, we noted a median sensitivity between 67% and 100%, a specificity between 66.7 and 71.4%, a positive predictive value between 66 and 75% and a negative predictive value between 70% and 100% in the test sets. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the metabolomics has a role in evaluating the biological effect of an investigational drug and may be a candidate biomarker as a secondary outcome measure in clinical trials.</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A pharmaco-metabolomics approach in a clinical trial of ALS: Identification of predictive markers of progression</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hélène Blasco, Franck Patin, Amandine Descat, Guillaume Garçon, Philippe Corcia, Patrick Gelé, Timothée Lenglet, Peter Bede, Vincent Meininger, David Devos, Jean François Gossens, Pierre-François Pradat&lt;/p&gt;

Visual impairment is a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where eye care is predominantly provided at the primary healthcare (PHC) level, known as primary eye care. This study aimed to perform an evaluation of primary eye care services in three districts of South Africa and to assess whether an ophthalmic health system strengthening (HSS) package could improve these services. Baseline surveys were conducted in Cape Winelands District, Johannesburg Health District and Mopani District at 14, 25 and 36 PHC facilities, respectively. Thereafter, the HSS package, comprising group training, individual mentoring, stakeholder engagement and resource provision, was implemented in 20 intervention sites in Mopani District, with the remaining 16 Mopani facilities serving as control sites. At baseline, less than half the facilities in Johannesburg and Mopani had dedicated eye care personnel or sufficient space to measure visual acuity. Although visual acuity charts were available in most facilities, &amp;lt;50% assessed patients at the correct distance. Median score for availability of nine essential drugs was &amp;lt;70%. Referral criteria knowledge was highest in Cape Winelands and Johannesburg, with poor clinical knowledge across all districts. Several HSS interventions produced successful outcomes: compared to control sites there was a significant increase in the proportion of intervention sites with eye care personnel and resources such as visual acuity charts (p = 0.02 and &amp;lt;0.01, respectively). However, engaging with district pharmacists did not improve availability of essential drugs (p = 0.47). Referral criteria knowledge improved significantly in intervention sites (p&amp;lt;0.01) but there was no improvement in clinical knowledge (p = 0.76). Primary eye care in South Africa faces multiple challenges with regard to organisation of care, resource availability and clinical competence.

Accurate characterization of morphological variation is crucial for generating reliable results and conclusions concerning changes and differences in form. Despite the prevalence of landmark-based geometric morphometric (GM) data in the scientific literature, a formal treatment of whether sampled landmarks adequately capture shape variation has remained elusive. Here, I introduce LaSEC (Landmark Sampling Evaluation Curve), a computational tool to assess the fidelity of morphological characterization by landmarks. This task is achieved by calculating how subsampled data converge to the pattern of shape variation in the full dataset as landmark sampling is increased incrementally. While the number of landmarks needed for adequate shape variation is dependent on individual datasets, LaSEC helps the user (1) identify under- and oversampling of landmarks; (2) assess robustness of morphological characterization; and (3) determine the number of landmarks that can be removed without compromising shape information. In practice, this knowledge could reduce time and cost associated with data collection, maintain statistical power in certain analyses, and enable the incorporation of incomplete, but important, specimens to the dataset. Results based on simulated shape data also reveal general properties of landmark data, including statistical consistency where sampling additional landmarks has the tendency to asymptotically improve the accuracy of morphological characterization. As landmark-based GM data become more widely adopted, LaSEC provides a systematic approach to evaluate and refine the collection of shape data––a goal paramount for accumulation and analysis of accurate morphological information.</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198341</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>How many landmarks are enough to characterize shape and size variation?</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Akinobu Watanabe&lt;/p&gt;

The pear (genus &lt;i&gt;Pyrus&lt;/i&gt;) is one of the most ancient and widely cultivated tree fruit crops in temperate climates. The Mount Etna area claims a large number of pear varieties differentiated due to a long history of cultivation and environmental variability, making this area particularly suitable for genetic studies. Ninety-five pear individuals were genotyped using the simple sequence repeat (SSR) methodology interrogating both the nuclear (nDNA) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) to combine an investigation of maternal inheritance of chloroplast SSRs (cpSSRs) with the high informativity of nuclear SSRs (nSSRs). The germplasm was selected ad hoc to include wild genotypes, local varieties, and national and international cultivated varieties. The objectives of this study were as follows: (i) estimate the level of differentiation within local varieties; (ii) elucidate the phylogenetic relationships between the cultivated genotypes and wild accessions; and (iii) estimate the potential genetic flow and the relationship among the germplasms in our analysis. Eight nSSRs detected a total of 136 alleles with an average minor allelic frequency and observed heterozygosity of 0.29 and 0.65, respectively, whereas cpSSRs allowed identification of eight haplotypes (S4 Table). These results shed light on the genetic relatedness between Italian varieties and wild genotypes.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Patients who have incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and an estimated intermediate risk (5–60%) of lung cancer frequently are followed via computed tomography (CT) surveillance to detect nodule growth, despite guidelines for a more aggressive diagnostic strategy. We examined the cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (AABT)—Early Cancer Detection Test-Lung (EarlyCDT-Lung&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;)—as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer among such patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate use of the AABT versus CT surveillance alone. In the model, patients with a positive AABT—because they are at substantially enhanced risk of lung cancer—are assumed to go directly to biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of lung cancer in earlier stages than under current guidelines (a beneficial stage shift). Patients with a negative AABT, and those scheduled for CT surveillance alone, are assumed to have periodic CT screenings to detect rapid growth and thus to have their lung cancers diagnosed—on average—at more advanced stages.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 1,000 patients who have incidentally detected nodules 8–30 mm, have an intermediate-risk of lung cancer, and are evaluated by CT surveillance alone, 95 (9.5%) are assumed to have lung cancer (local, 73.6%; regional, 22.0%; distant, 4.4%). With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 41%/93% (stage shift = 10.8%), although expected costs would be higher by $949,442 ($949 per person), life years would be higher by 53 (0.05 per person), resulting in a cost per life-year gained of $18,029 and a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $24,330. With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 28%/98% (stage shift = 7.4%), corresponding cost-effectiveness ratios would be $18,454 and $24,833.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Under our base-case assumptions, and reasonable variations thereof, using AABT as an aid in the early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with incidentally detected pulmonary nodules who are estimated to be at intermediate risk of lung cancer and are scheduled for CT surveillance alone is likely to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197826</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (&amp;lt;i&gt;Early&amp;lt;/i&gt;CDT-Lung) as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with incidentally detected pulmonary nodules</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by John Edelsberg, Derek Weycker, Mark Atwood, Geoffrey Hamilton-Fairley, James R.

Identification of cancer driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity, many driver mutations occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from passenger mutations. Here, we show that a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach, named rDriver can achieve enhanced prediction accuracy by identifying mutations that not only have high functional impact scores but also are associated with systemic variation in gene expression levels. In examining 3,080 tumor samples from 8 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, rDriver predicted 1,389 driver mutations. Compared with existing tools, rDriver identified more low frequency mutations associated with lineage specific functional properties, timing of occurrence and patient survival. Evaluation of rDriver predictions using engineered cell-line models resulted in a positive predictive value of 0.94 in &lt;i&gt;PIK3CA&lt;/i&gt; genes. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multi-omic data in predicting cancer driver mutations and provides a statistically rigorous solution for cancer target discovery and development.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196939</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Cancer driver mutation prediction through Bayesian integration of multi-omic data</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zixing Wang, Kwok-Shing Ng, Tenghui Chen, Tae-Beom Kim, Fang Wang, Kenna Shaw, Kenneth L.

Urban economies are composed of diverse activities, embodied in labor occupations, which depend on one another to produce goods and services. Yet little is known about how the nature and intensity of these interdependences change as cities increase in population size and economic complexity. Understanding the relationship between occupational interdependencies and the number of occupations defining an urban economy is relevant because interdependence within a networked system has implications for system resilience and for how easily can the structure of the network be modified. Here, we represent the interdependencies among occupations in a city as a non-spatial information network, where the strengths of interdependence between pairs of occupations determine the strengths of the links in the network. Using those quantified link strengths we calculate a single metric of interdependence–or connectedness–which is equivalent to the density of a city’s weighted occupational network. We then examine urban systems in six industrialized countries, analyzing how the density of urban occupational networks changes with network size, measured as the number of unique occupations present in an urban workforce. We find that in all six countries, density, or economic interdependence, increases superlinearly with the number of distinct occupations. Because connections among occupations represent flows of information, we provide evidence that connectivity scales superlinearly with network size in information networks.</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196915</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Urban occupational structures as information networks: The effect on network density of increasing number of occupations</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shade T.

Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Maharana, S., Wang, J., Papadopoulos, D.

A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate and improve the “late-night dining” options in a university dining hall. Surveys assessed student desires for late-night offerings, and evaluated students’ habits and motivations during late-night dining. Two interventions were implemented to see if students could be “nudged” into different choice patterns. In the first, a “veggie-heavy” entrée was added at the beginning of the entrée line, so that students would substitute an entrée containing vegetables for the alternatives. In the second, a snack-food bar was set up to cater to students who didn’t want to stand in the long entrée line, and preferred a snack. Data on food choice was collected during the interventions. Survey responses showed significant differences in the reasons females and males utilized late-night dining (p&amp;lt;0.001). We also found that students at late-night dining had a lower emphasis on health than the general student population. Even students at late-night who reported being health-conscious showed no difference in food selections from students who said health was not important (p = 0.883). Veggie-heavy entrées had mild success in increasing vegetable selection. However, veggie-heavy entrées were largely ignored when the other option was chicken nuggets. The snack bar was very popular. Entrée placement and convenience lines may have mild impacts on food selection in a late-night dining environment.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198162</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>You can’t “nudge” nuggets: An investigation of college late-night dining with behavioral economics interventions</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Bevet, Meredith T.
