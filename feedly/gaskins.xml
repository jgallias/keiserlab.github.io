This study examined how people evaluate ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors, especially their predictions of the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors (Study 1). Further, it examined the individual effects of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors of an actor on the evaluation of his/her trait by considering the cases where the actor engages in and does not engage in the other behavior (Study 2). Study 1 revealed that the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors was perceived asymmetrically. Specifically, while the likelihood of ordinary prosocial actors to engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors was perceived as high, the same perception was not observed for extraordinary prosocial behaviors. On the other hand, extraordinary prosocial actors were perceived as highly likely to engage in both ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Study 2 revealed that the evaluation of actors who engaged in extraordinary prosocial behaviors but not ordinary prosocial behaviors did not exceed the evaluation of actors who engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors but not extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Additionally, the effect of extraordinary prosocial behaviors was more when the actor also engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors. These results suggest that extraordinary prosocial actors are evaluated highly when they also engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba5:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Is extraordinary prosocial behavior more valuable than ordinary prosocial behavior?</title><fingerprint>40977dd5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ikumi Futamura&lt;/p&gt;

This study aimed to establish a new methodology for upgrading biomass quality using low-temperature (below 100 °C) oxidation to achieve simultaneous drying and decomposition. Sterilized manure (63% wet basis) was heated at 90 °C for 49 days under an oxidative environment. The obtained solid and moisture reduction curves indicated that drying and decomposition proceeded simultaneously. The biomass was decomposed by oxidation with the release of water, carbon dioxide, and volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid. The oxidation process stopped when the biomass was dehydrated, indicating that the water originally present in the biomass governed the process. Elemental and calorific analyses revealed no remarkable increase in carbon content or increased heating value, and a slight decrease in oxygen content. Although the severity of the process was insufficient to produce an optimum solid fuel due to the low temperature used, the process would enable the stabilization of waste biomass with low energy consumption such as using waste heat.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb9f:7d6c1c1c</id><title>A new approach to stabilize waste biomass for valorization using an oxidative process at 90 °C</title><fingerprint>17c8124c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takanori Itoh, Kazunori Iwabuchi, Kumpei Ota&lt;/p&gt;

Mitigating extreme heat in urban areas is beneficial and sometimes critical to human health. Thriving plant communities in community parks play an important role in mitigating extreme heat through providing cooling effect, while inevitably affecting how people perceive the benefits of using community parks for recreation. Thus, the impacts of plant communities on the thermal environment should be quantified to determine the optimal structure of the plant community. The goal would be to harmonize the functions of improving the thermal environment with the preferences people have related to the recreational benefits of plant communities with various levels of vegetation density. In this paper, the correlations between the structural characteristics of plant communities and their function in mitigating the thermal environment were investigated on calm summer days in Xincheng Central Park, Minhang District, Shanghai, China. In addition to analyzing the plant communities present and their effects on the park microclimate, a questionnaire was employed to determine the plant community preferences of recreational park users. The results showed that plant communities could reduce the air temperature by 1.23–2.42 °C and increase the relative humidity by 2.4–4.2% during the daytime. The microclimate conditions in plant communities with varying vegetation densities were significantly different. The canopy density and leaf area index primarily controlled the temperature reduction, while the canopy density and total canopy cover ratio primarily controlled the increase in humidity; meanwhile, these correlations varied at different times of the day. Moreover, most of the park users preferred a moderately dense plant community which met their environmental perceptions for recreation in parks. Age or education level variables of park users would also predict preferences for different plant community densities. Ultimately, one plant community pattern with appropriate canopy density (60%), leaf area index (≥3) and canopy cover ratio (total 0.80–1.20, with 0.6–0.75 for trees and 0.20–0.45 for shrubs/woodland area) was recommended, which would harmonize the functions of the mitigation of the thermal environment with most people’s perception of a desirable vegetation density.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fdf3a72a:5f7707:9f3b30f2</id><title>The ecological services of plant communities in parks for climate control and recreation—A case study in Shanghai, China</title><fingerprint>abc5b14e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhigang Li, Dan Chen, Shize Cai, Shengquan Che&lt;/p&gt;

There is evidence that altering stress mindset—the belief that stress is enhancing vs. debilitating—can change cognitive, affective and physiological responses to stress. However individual differences in responsiveness to stress mindset manipulations have not been explored. Given the previously established role of catecholamines in both placebo effects and stress, we hypothesized that genetic variation in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines, would moderate responses to an intervention intended to alter participants’ mindsets about stress. Participants (N = 107) were exposed to a stress mindset manipulation (videos highlighting either the enhancing or debilitating effects of stress) prior to engaging in a Trier Social Stress task and subsequent cognitive tasks. The associations of the &lt;i&gt;COMT&lt;/i&gt; rs4680 polymorphism with the effect of stress mindset video manipulations on cognitive and affective responses were examined. Genetic variation at rs4680 modified the effects of stress mindset on affective and cognitive responses to stress. Individuals homozygous for rs4680 low-activity allele (met/met) were responsive to the stress-is-enhancing mindset manipulation as indicated by greater increases in positive affect, improved cognitive functioning, and happiness bias in response to stress. Conversely, individuals homozygous for the high-activity allele (val/val) were not as responsive to the stress mindset manipulation. These results suggest that responses to stress mindset intervention may vary with &lt;i&gt;COMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype. These findings contribute to the understanding of gene by environment interactions for mindset interventions and stress reactivity and therefore warrant further investigations.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fa:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Catechol-O-Methyltransferase moderates effect of stress mindset on affect and cognition</title><fingerprint>c1bbc3e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alia J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Body Mass Index (BMI), like most human phenotypes, is substantially heritable. However, BMI is not normally distributed; the skew appears to be structural, and increases as a function of age. Moreover, twin correlations for BMI commonly violate the assumptions of the most common variety of the classical twin model, with the MZ twin correlation greater than twice the DZ correlation. This study aimed to decompose twin correlations for BMI using more general skew-t distributions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Same sex MZ and DZ twin pairs (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 7,086) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry were included. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to decompose twin correlations for BMI into multiple mixture distributions. LPA was performed using the default normal mixture distribution and the skew-t mixture distribution. Similar analyses were performed for height as a comparison. Our analyses are then replicated in an independent dataset.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A two-class solution under the skew-t mixture distribution fits the BMI distribution for both genders. The first class consists of a relatively normally distributed, highly heritable BMI with a mean in the normal range. The second class is a positively skewed BMI in the overweight and obese range, with lower twin correlations. In contrast, height is normally distributed, highly heritable, and is well-fit by a single latent class. Results in the replication dataset were highly similar.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that two distinct processes underlie the skew of the BMI distribution. The contrast between height and weight is in accord with subjective psychological experience: both are under obvious genetic influence, but BMI is also subject to behavioral control, whereas height is not.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424d:9f3b30f2</id><title>Differential models of twin correlations in skew for body-mass index (BMI)</title><fingerprint>c59c7c25</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siny Tsang, Glen E.

It has been proposed that NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-specificity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) evolved as an adaptation of microorganisms to grow on acetate as the sole source of carbon and energy. In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, changing the cofactor specificity of ICDH from NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (cofactor swapping) decreases the growth rate on acetate. However, the metabolic basis of this phenotype has not been analyzed. In this work, we used constraint-based modeling to investigate the effect of the cofactor swapping of ICDH in terms of energy production, response of alternative sources of NADPH, and partitioning of fluxes between ICDH and isocitrate lyase (ICL) -a crucial bifurcation when the bacterium grows on acetate-. We generated &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains expressing NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-specific ICDH instead of the native enzyme, and bearing the deletion of the NADPH-producing transhydrogenase PntAB. We measured their growth rate and acetate uptake rate, modeled the distribution of metabolic fluxes by Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and quantified the specific activities of NADPH-producing dehydrogenases in central pathways. The cofactor swapping of ICDH led to one-third decrease in biomass yield, irrespective of the presence of PntAB. According to our simulations, the diminution in growth rate observed upon cofactor swapping could be explained by one-half decrease in the total production of NADPH and a lower availability of carbon for biosynthesis because of a change in the partition at the isocitrate bifurcation. Together with an increased total ATP production, this scenario resulted in a 10-fold increment in the flux of ATP not used for growing purposes. PntAB was identified as the primary NADPH balancing response, with the dehydrogenases of the oxidative branch of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and the malic enzyme playing a role in its absence. We propose that in the context of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; growing on acetate, the NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-specificity of ICDH is a trait that impacts not only NADPH production, but also the efficient allocation of carbon and energy.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e804:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Understanding the impact of the cofactor swapping of isocitrate dehydrogenase over the growth phenotype of &amp;lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; on acetate by using constraint-based modeling</title><fingerprint>f3dd3826</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erick Armingol, Eduardo Tobar, Ricardo Cabrera&lt;/p&gt;

Context &lt;p&gt;Obese patients are raising specific questions in emergency care such as equipment issues or urgent procedures. Even though obesity prevalence and subsequent health expenditure are increasing worldwide, there is scarce literature about their specific resource utilization of Emergency Departments (ED). These few studies do not take into account both socio-economic situation and comorbidities which are well-known factors influencing healthcare use. Our objective was to assess the emergency care resource utilization of obese individuals (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30kg.m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to normal-weight individuals taking into account comorbidities and social-economic situations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The French CONSTANCES epidemiologic cohort is a randomly selected sample of French adults. Participants data are linked to the National Health Insurance Database collecting all medical acts. The rate of ED visits of obese (and each obesity class) and normal-weight participants were compared considering confounding factors (comorbidities, various socio-economic data). The primary endpoint was to have visited the ED between 2010 and 2013. Sex-separated analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were performed and adjusted odds-ratios [OR] (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]) were calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 21,035 normal-weight and 5,003 obese participants. Obese participants visited the ED more often than normal-weight participants (men: 30.5% vs. 26.7%; women: 30.3% vs. 24.4%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Obese participants presented more comorbidities and a lower socio-economic situation than normal-weight participants. After adjustment, obese participants had a higher risk of visiting ED (men: OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.04–1.33; and women: OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.22–1.52), with a higher risk for class III participants (BMI ≥ 40 kg.m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) (men: OR = 2.18; CI 95%: 1.32–3.63; and women: OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.38–2.49).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Obese individuals have a higher level of emergency care resource utilization than normal-weight individuals and it increases with severe obesity.

There is a quest for production of soluble protein of high quality for the study of T-cell receptors (TCRs), but expression often results in low yields of functional molecules. In this study, we used an &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; chaperone-assisted periplasmic production system and compared expression of 4 different soluble TCR formats: single-chain TCR (scTCR), two different disulfide-linked TCR (dsTCR) formats, and chimeric Fab (cFab). A stabilized version of scTCR was also included. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of host (XL1-Blue or RosettaBlue&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) and the effect of IPTG induction on expression profiles. A celiac disease patient-derived TCR with specificity for gluten was used, and we achieved detectable expression for all formats and variants. We found that expression in RosettaBlue&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; without IPTG induction resulted in the highest periplasmic yields. Moreover, after large-scale expression and protein purification, only the scTCR format was obtained in high yields. Importantly, stability engineering of the scTCR was a prerequisite for obtaining reliable biophysical characterization of the TCR-pMHC interaction. The scTCR format is readily compatible with high-throughput screening approaches that may enable both development of reagents allowing for defined peptide MHC (pMHC) characterization and discovery of potential novel therapeutic leads.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d4:9f3b30f2</id><title>Soluble T-cell receptor design influences functional yield in an &amp;lt;i&gt;E&amp;lt;/i&gt;. &amp;lt;i&gt;coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; chaperone-assisted expression system</title><fingerprint>12e8fc96</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kristin Støen Gunnarsen, Lene Støkken Høydahl, Ralf Stefan Neumann, Kaare Bjerregaard-Andersen, Nicolay Rustad Nilssen, Ludvig Magne Sollid, Inger Sandlie, Geir Åge Løset&lt;/p&gt;

First off, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/17/approvals-and-otherwise-in-oncology&quot;&gt;this 2015 post&lt;/a&gt; mentions the steep drop in shares of Clovis Biotechnology, brought on by a rather sudden revision in the announced clinical performance of their lead drug (the covalent kinase inhibitor rociletinib). Well, it appears that the SEC found this to be rather abrupt as well, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/more-than-2-years-after-the-ugly-roci-debacle-clovis-says-that-the-sec-is-prepping-civil-charges/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endpts&lt;/em&gt; now reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company has been under investigation. Some of their investors have long claimed that the presentation of the clinical data had been manipulated in order to keep the company’s stock price up, and it looks like that theory is getting a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth remembering the different time scales involved. Think of the different parts of a cell: you get fast service from receptors and second-messenger systems (starting on a time scale of less than a second), but if you’re waiting for proteins to be synthesized, you need to come back in a few hours. Likewise the stock market reacts pretty quickly to bad news (Clovis got sold off on that news as if the shares were giving off radon gas), but the regulatory authorities are much slower. That said, they’re also pretty hard to dislodge once they get a fix on your position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the markets can take a while to react to things, too, because it’s differences of opinion that make them work in the first place. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/07/30/another_alzheimers_ipo&quot;&gt;Here’s another post&lt;/a&gt; from 2015 where I wrote about the IPO of a company (vTv Therapeutics, formerly TransTech) trying to make a go of it with a retread Alzheimer’s therapy. The comparison with Axovant was obvious at the time, and some readers will recall &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/09/27/bad-news-but-not-the-unexpected-kind&quot;&gt;what eventually happened to them&lt;/a&gt; when their own drug failed yet again in an Alzheimer’s trial. As that post mentioned, I was short Axovant stock when that took place (an event that financed the purchase of a new 18-inch Dobsonian telescope around here). Well, vTv &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xconomy.com/raleigh-durham/2018/04/09/with-alzheimers-failure-vtv-fares-no-better-than-old-partner-pfizer/&quot;&gt;announced their own clinical trial results&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, and to no one’s particular surprise, the compound failed for them, just as it had for Pfizer back in the day when TransTech had licensed it to them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s stock had been up over $7 earlier in the year, on what I thought was rather misplaced optimism. I sold them short in January at $7.42, and have been careful not to write about them in any way since doing so (in fact, I haven’t mentioned them at all since that 2015 post). VTVT &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/vtvt?p=vtvt&quot;&gt;had been dropping&lt;/a&gt; since then, and was back down in the $3 range before they announced this news, but that failed trial sent them down steeply. At that point I naturally covered my position, which is one reason I mention it now. The stock is trading this morning at about $0.67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know, if someone else comes along with a drug that’s already failed one or two Alzheimer’s trials, I’m very likely to short them, too. One of these days some odd AD mechanism is (I hope) going to work, but given the odds of clinical success, financing things like Axovant’s or vTv’s drugs that have &lt;em&gt;already failed in the clinic&lt;/em&gt; seems like a bad idea. And that’s the other reason I’m bringing up my short sales of these companies: I (and the other people who were also short these outfits) should actually not be handed such opportunities. Axovant and vTv should not, in a more rational market, have been able to go public as blithely as they did with the assets that they had, and their market caps should not have achieved what heights they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great time to finance small biopharma companies (and here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LifeSciVC/status/983763134090530816&quot;&gt;a series of Twitter posts&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Booth with some good advice on that subject).

Worldwide, 500,000 cases of head and neck cancer (HNC) are reported each year and the primary treatment for HNC is radiotherapy. Although the goal of radiotherapy is to target the tumor, secondary exposure occurs in surrounding normal tissues, such as the salivary glands. As a result, despite successful treatment of the cancer, patients are left with long-term side effects due to direct damage to the salivary glands. The effect is chronic and currently there is no treatment. Stem cells are an attractive therapeutic option for treatment of radiation-induced glandular dysfunction because of the potential to regenerate damaged cell populations and restore salivary gland function. However, limited knowledge about the endogenous stem cell population post irradiation hinders the development for stem cell-based therapies. In this study, an ex vivo sphere formation cell culture system was utilized to assess the self-renewal capacity of cells derived from parotid salivary glands at a chronic time point following radiation. Salivary glands from irradiated mice generate significantly fewer salispheres, but can be stimulated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to generate an equivalent number of salispheres as unirradiated salivary glands. Interestingly, the number and size of salispheres formed is dependent on the concentration of FBS supplemented into the media. Salispheres derived from irradiated glands and cultured in FBS media were found to contain cells that proliferate and express progenitor and acinar cell markers such as Keratin 5, Keratin 14, Aquaporin 5, and NKCC1. Utilization of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) injections following radiation treatment restores salivary gland function and improves salisphere generation. These findings indicate that stimulation of these cellular populations may provide a promising avenue for the development of cell-based therapies for radiation-induced salivary gland damage.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2809:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Administration of growth factors promotes salisphere formation from irradiated parotid salivary glands</title><fingerprint>93bf62c6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vicky T.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Amino-acids positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly used in the diagnostic workup of patients with gliomas, including differential diagnosis, evaluation of tumor extension, treatment planning and follow-up.

Ground truth segmentations were obtained using manual delineation and thresholding (1.3 x background). The volumetric CNN was implemented based on a modified Keras implementation of a U-Net library with 3 layers for the encoding and decoding paths. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used as an accuracy measure of segmentation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-seven patients were included (26 [70%] in the training set and 11 [30%] in the validation set). All 11 lesions were accurately detected with no false positive, resulting in a sensitivity and a specificity for the detection at the tumor level of 100%. After 150 epochs, DSC reached 0.7924 in the training set and 0.7911 in the validation set. After morphological dilatation and fixed thresholding of the predicted U-Net mask a substantial improvement of the DSC to 0.8231 (+ 4.1%) was noted.

The human brain has the impressive capacity to adapt how it processes information to high-level goals. While it is known that these cognitive control skills are malleable and can be improved through training, the underlying plasticity mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we develop and evaluate a model of how people learn when to exert cognitive control, which controlled process to use, and how much effort to exert. We derive this model from a general theory according to which the function of cognitive control is to select and configure neural pathways so as to make optimal use of finite time and limited computational resources. The central idea of our Learned Value of Control model is that people use reinforcement learning to predict the value of candidate control signals of different types and intensities based on stimulus features. This model correctly predicts the learning and transfer effects underlying the adaptive control-demanding behavior observed in an experiment on visual attention and four experiments on interference control in Stroop and Flanker paradigms. Moreover, our model explained these findings significantly better than an associative learning model and a Win-Stay Lose-Shift model. Our findings elucidate how learning and experience might shape people’s ability and propensity to adaptively control their minds and behavior. We conclude by predicting under which circumstances these learning mechanisms might lead to self-control failure.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Aj4DbuvGLfQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162fdf4e8f7:3b1d0b:a96d255</id><title>Rational metareasoning and the plasticity of cognitive control</title><fingerprint>d246a9b3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Falk Lieder, Amitai Shenhav, Sebastian Musslick, Thomas L.

As a Java library, it further provides core data structures to the GINsim and EpiLog interactive tools, which supply graphical interfaces and additional analysis methods for cellular and multi-cellular qualitative models.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004920</link><updated>1524603600000</updated><engagementRate>1.36</engagementRate><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/3S3tn6RO_8s/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Tu Anh Nguyen</name></author><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004920</originId><published>1524603600000</published><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004920</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>19</engagement><crawled>1524591809657</crawled><recrawled>1524594787541</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tu Anh Nguyen, Jamie Greig, Asif Khan, Cara Goh, Gregory Jedd&lt;/p&gt;
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can promote evolutionary adaptation by transforming a species’ relationship to the environment. In most well-understood cases of HGT, acquired and donor functions appear to remain closely related. Thus, the degree to which HGT can lead to evolutionary novelties remains unclear. Mucorales fungi sense gravity through the sedimentation of vacuolar protein crystals. Here, we identify the octahedral crystal matrix protein (OCTIN). Phylogenetic analysis strongly supports acquisition of &lt;i&gt;octin&lt;/i&gt; by HGT from bacteria. A bacterial OCTIN forms high-order periplasmic oligomers, and inter-molecular disulphide bonds are formed by both fungal and bacterial OCTINs, suggesting that they share elements of a conserved assembly mechanism. However, estimated sedimentation velocities preclude a gravity-sensing function for the bacterial structures. Together, our data suggest that HGT from bacteria into the Mucorales allowed a dramatic increase in assembly scale and emergence of the gravity-sensing function. We conclude that HGT can lead to evolutionary novelties that emerge depending on the physiological and cellular context of protein assembly.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3S3tn6RO_8s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f8c0d479:29c06b:ae8b474d</id><title>Evolutionary novelty in gravity sensing through horizontal gene transfer and high-order protein assembly</title><fingerprint>305bb730</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tu Anh Nguyen, Jamie Greig, Asif Khan, Cara Goh, Gregory Jedd&lt;/p&gt;

In cases of natural disasters, epidemics or even in dangerous situations like an act of terrorism, battle fields, a shooting or a mountain accident, finding survivors is a challenge. In these kind of situations it is sometimes critical to know if a person has vital signs or not, without the need to be in contact with the victim, thus avoiding jeopardizing the lives of the rescue workers. In this work, we propose the use of video magnification techniques to detect small movements in human bodies due to breathing that are invisible to the naked eye. Two different video magnification techniques, intensity-based and phase-based, were tested. The utility of these techniques to detect people who are alive but injured in risk situations was verified by simulating a scene with three people involved in an accident. Several factors such as camera stability, distance to the object, light conditions, magnification factor or computing time were analyzed. The results obtained were quite positive for both techniques, intensity-based method proving more adequate if the interest is in almost instant results whereas the phase-based method is more appropriate if processing time is not so relevant but the degree of magnification without excessive image noise.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd88:9f3b30f2</id><title>Detection of human vital signs in hazardous environments by means of video magnification</title><fingerprint>76a1cb83</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Celestino Ordóñez, Carlos Cabo, Agustín Menéndez, Antonio Bello&lt;/p&gt;

Osteoblast differentiation is a highly regulated process that requires coordinated information from both soluble factors and the extracellular matrix. Among these extracellular stimuli, chemical and physical properties of the matrix are sensed through cell surface receptors such as integrins and transmitted into the nucleus to drive specific gene expression. Here, we showed that the conditional deletion of β1 integrins in the osteo-precursor population severely impacts bone formation and homeostasis both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Mutant mice displayed a severe bone deficit characterized by bone fragility and reduced bone mass. We showed that β1 integrins are required for proper BMP2 dependent signaling at the pre-osteoblastic stage, by positively modulating Smad1/5-dependent transcriptional activity at the nuclear level. The lack of β1 integrins results in a transcription modulation that relies on a cooperative defect with other transcription factors rather than a plain blunted BMP2 response. Our results point to a nuclear modulation of Smad1/5 transcriptional activity by β1 integrins, allowing a tight control of osteoblast differentiation.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fe:7d6c1c1c</id><title>β1 integrins mediate the BMP2 dependent transcriptional control of osteoblast differentiation and osteogenesis</title><fingerprint>f42ce162</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Molly Brunner, Noémie Mandier, Thierry Gautier, Genevieve Chevalier, Anne-Sophie Ribba, Philippe Guardiola, Marc R.

Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined.

Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196573</link><updated>1524776400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196573</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Gabrielle Brankston</name></author><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196573</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1524776400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gabrielle Brankston, Cyndi Boughen, Victoria Ng, David N.

&lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; is a waterborne parasite that causes diarrheal disease in humans and in cattle. Risk factors for human illness include contact with surface water such as lakes and rivers, exposure to contaminated municipal drinking water, as well as zoonotic transmission from livestock and agriculture. The objectives of this study are twofold: 1) to describe the temporal distribution of cryptosporidiosis in Southwestern Ontario; and 2) to determine the distribution of human cryptosporidiosis, in relation to exposures such as cryptosporidium positive cattle farms, weather events, and hydrological factors. Seasonal trends in 214 bovine and 87 human cases were assessed using regression models that predicted monthly case counts in relation to observed monthly case counts. A case-crossover approach was used to evaluate acute associations between daily environmental exposures, such as weather, hydrology, the presence of &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; positive cattle farms within the region, and the risk of human &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; infection. Annual seasonality was found for both human cases and bovine cases with human cases peaking in mid-summer and bovine cases peaking in late winter to early spring. Bovine cases that occurred 21 days prior to human cases were associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of human case occurrence. At both 9 and 14 days prior to human case onset, the odds of a human case increased twofold per 10-degree Celsius increase in air temperature. These results provide a preliminary hypothesis for the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis from cattle to humans via the environment and suggest that the timing of environmental conditions in relation to case occurrence is biologically plausible.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7d:fc1f8953</id><title>Assessing the impact of environmental exposures and &amp;lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&amp;lt;/i&gt; infection in cattle on human incidence of cryptosporidiosis in Southwestern Ontario, Canada</title><fingerprint>33b9efb3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabrielle Brankston, Cyndi Boughen, Victoria Ng, David N.

Bittersweet (&lt;i&gt;Solanum dulcamara&lt;/i&gt;) is a native Old World member of the nightshade family. This European diploid species can be found from marshlands to high mountainous regions and it is a common weed that serves as an alternative host and source of resistance genes against plant pathogens such as late blight (&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora infestans&lt;/i&gt;). We sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of bittersweet, which is 155,580 bp in length and it is characterized by a typical quadripartite structure composed of a large (85,901 bp) and small (18,449 bp) single-copy region interspersed by two identical inverted repeats (25,615 bp). It consists of 112 unique genes from which 81 are protein-coding, 27 tRNA and four rRNA genes. All bittersweet plastid genes including non-functional ones and even intergenic spacer regions are transcribed in primary plastid transcripts covering 95.22% of the genome. These are later substantially edited in a post-transcriptional phase to activate gene functions. By comparing the bittersweet plastid genome with all available Solanaceae sequences we found that gene content and synteny are highly conserved across the family. During genome comparison we have identified several annotation errors, which we have corrected in a manual curation process then we have identified the major plastid genome structural changes in Solanaceae. Interpreted in a phylogenetic context they seem to provide additional support for larger clades. The plastid genome sequence of bittersweet could help to benchmark Solanaceae plastid genome annotations and could be used as a reference for further studies. Such reliable annotations are important for gene diversity calculations, synteny map constructions and assigning partitions for phylogenetic analysis with de novo sequenced plastomes of Solanaceae.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67ac:91749e5b</id><title>The chloroplast genome sequence of bittersweet (&amp;lt;i&gt;Solanum dulcamara&amp;lt;/i&gt;): Plastid genome structure evolution in Solanaceae</title><fingerprint>aa621f38</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ali Amiryousefi, Jaakko Hyvönen, Péter Poczai&lt;/p&gt;

Such reliable annotations are important for gene diversity calculations, synteny map constructions and assigning partitions for phylogenetic analysis with de novo sequenced plastomes of Solanaceae.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03657-3</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/4ezEzwWBcrg/s41467-018-03657-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03657-3</originId><unread>False</unread><author><name>Romy Lorenz</name></author><published>1522047600000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03657-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522056367181</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dissociating frontoparietal brain networks with neuroadaptive Bayesian optimization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissociating frontoparietal brain networks with neuroadaptive Bayesian optimization, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03657-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03657-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The unique contributions of different frontoparietal networks (FPNs) in cognition remains unclear.

The powerful HiSeq X sequencers with their patterned flowcell technology and fast turnaround times are instrumental for many large-scale genomic and epigenomic studies. However, assessment of DNA methylation by sodium bisulfite treatment results in sequencing libraries of low diversity, which may impact data quality and yield. In this report we assess the quality of WGBS data generated on the HiSeq X system in comparison with data generated on the HiSeq 2500 system and the newly released NovaSeq system. We report a systematic issue with low basecall quality scores assigned to guanines in the second read of WGBS when using certain Real Time Analysis (RTA) software versions on the HiSeq X sequencer, reminiscent of an issue that was previously reported with certain HiSeq 2500 software versions. However, with the HD.3.4.0 /RTA 2.7.7 software upgrade for the HiSeq X system, we observed an overall improved quality and yield of the WGBS data generated, which in turn empowers cost-effective and high quality DNA methylation studies.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccbe:34f43e70</id><title>Data quality of whole genome bisulfite sequencing on Illumina platforms</title><fingerprint>361f8d41</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amanda Raine, Ulrika Liljedahl, Jessica Nordlund&lt;/p&gt;

Local and spontaneous calcium signals play important roles in neurons and neuronal networks. Spontaneous or cell-autonomous calcium signals may be difficult to assess because they appear in an unpredictable spatiotemporal pattern and in very small neuronal loci of axons or dendrites. We developed an open source bioinformatics tool for an unbiased assessment of calcium signals in x,y-t imaging series. The tool bases its algorithm on a continuous wavelet transform-guided peak detection to identify calcium signal candidates. The highly sensitive calcium event definition is based on identification of peaks in 1D data through analysis of a 2D wavelet transform surface. For spatial analysis, the tool uses a grid to separate the x,y-image field in independently analyzed grid windows. A document containing a graphical summary of the data is automatically created and displays the loci of activity for a wide range of signal intensities. Furthermore, the number of activity events is summed up to create an estimated total activity value, which can be used to compare different experimental situations, such as calcium activity before or after an experimental treatment. All traces and data of active loci become documented. The tool can also compute the signal variance in a sliding window to visualize activity-dependent signal fluctuations. We applied the calcium signal detector to monitor activity states of cultured mouse neurons. Our data show that both the total activity value and the variance area created by a sliding window can distinguish experimental manipulations of neuronal activity states. Notably, the tool is powerful enough to compute local calcium events and ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in small loci of distal neurites of neurons, which remain during pharmacological blockade of neuronal activity with inhibitors such as tetrodotoxin, to block action potential firing, or inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The tool can also offer information about local homeostatic calcium activity events in neurites.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fH_ykpqpmQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16278056b21:115fb02:bdf8aaf1</id><title>An open source tool for automatic spatiotemporal assessment of calcium transients and local ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in calcium imaging data</title><fingerprint>a4e34836</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Prada, Manju Sasi, Corinna Martin, Sibylle Jablonka, Thomas Dandekar, Robert Blum&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to analyze the position of the lumbopelvic region and the muscle activation of erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles in a group of pregnant women in the third trimester. The hypothesis was that pregnancy-related biomechanical and morphological changes modify the position of the lumbopelvic region and the activation of extensor muscles. The position of the lumbar spine and pelvis in the sagittal plane, and the EMG activity of the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles, were recorded during standing in 34 nulliparous and 34 pregnant women in the third trimester, and also two months after birth in the group of pregnant women. No significant differences in the position of the lumbar spine or pelvis between the group of pregnant women and nulliparous or postpartum were observed. A significant increase was observed in the EMG activity of the erector spinae (4.6% vs 2.4% and 2.1% in the nulliparous group and postpartum respectively) and the biceps femoris (3.4% vs 1.2% and 1.4%) in pregnant women compared to the other two groups (p &amp;lt;0.01). We conclude that pregnant women in the third trimester show no alterations in lumbopelvic position compared to nulliparous and postpartum women. However, there is an increase of the EMG activity of the trunk extensors. These results indicate that the extensor muscles of the trunk show, in static positions, adaptive responses to the increase of anterior loads during pregnancy.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f14:9f3b30f2</id><title>Changes in trunk posture and muscle responses in standing during pregnancy and postpartum</title><fingerprint>3af0ee32</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gemma Biviá-Roig, Juan Francisco Lisón, Daniel Sánchez-Zuriaga&lt;/p&gt;

So far I have yet to come across a drug discovery organization that really thinks that its compound libraries are what they should be – there are too many of those similar compounds from those similar projects that we used to be into back when, there are too many of those compounds that we purchased from vendors X and Y and Z, there are too many insoluble ones or decomposing ones or just plain boring ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s natural to think that the way to better screening results is to have a better compound collection – I mean, what could be more obvious? And it’s also obvious that every compound collection could always improve – it could be larger, or less greasy, or less streaked with legacy compounds that have too much baggage, etc. I don’t think it ever does harm to address these issues. The question is, how much good does it do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask that question just because of the numbers involved. You have the numbers in your own collection, and you have the numbers in chemical space in general. The first is probably pretty large, and the second is larger than any human mind can deal with. Any one company’s compound collection – any one &lt;em&gt;planet’s&lt;/em&gt; compound collection – is a tiny mote in the sky of chemical space, even broadly druglike chemical space. So you’re not going to make much headway on the absolute scale, no matter how many diversity compounds you can get into vials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching to the relative scale, then, you’re still going to have to make a pretty big effort to change your own collection’s character. This is why organizations have, over the years, tended to divide their collections into subfractions. Here are X thousand compounds to represent the deck as a whole – that’s something to use to try an assay out to troubleshoot it and get an idea of what the hit rate will be if you go on. Here’s the fraction of the deck that meets these particular biophysical criteria (and over here is the fraction of the deck that doesn’t). Here’s the fragment collection, here’s the more natural-product-like end of things, here’s the deliberately more three-dimensional set, and so on. In some (many?) companies, a classic screen-the-whole-deck situation has gotten more rare over the years, although there are always targets that need that and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up another consideration: sometimes you want more compounds because you’re not really getting any actionable hits in a screen (particularly against those tough targets). And sometimes you want more compounds because while you’re getting real hits, they’re not hits that you like. Maybe they’re from those legacy projects and the IP/selectivity considerations are too much of a hairball, or they’re coming out too nonpolar or with too few vectors for further optimization, what have you. You’d rather start somewhere else, and the deck doesn’t give you as many somewhere-elses as you’d want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the second category has a better chance of being fixed by adding swaths of new compounds – at least you know that the target is capable of binding small molecules. Now, it can always be the problem that the target just wants ugly chemical matter (CETP is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2012/06/29/the_cetp_rogues_gallery&quot;&gt;classic example&lt;/a&gt;), in which case there may not be much to do about it, but there will surely be other projects where something more workable presents itself. But the first category – just not getting hits – is a tougher situation. You can get stuck in an unprovable-hypothesis loop: if you didn’t get hits, you need more compounds. So you add more, and you didn’t get hits – well, you didn’t add enough, or the right ones. Who’s to say that the winner isn’t just over the horizon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a question that combichem was supposed to help answer back about twenty years ago or so, and it’s the question that its sequel, DNA-encoded library screening, is supposed to help answer now. From the beginning, the tricky part of the latter compounds sets has been the number of reactions compatible with the attached DNA barcodes. Combichem had that problem, too, in its early days: what price another ten thousand aryl amides? But (partly because of that grim experience) the DEL folks have been, right from the start, trying to expand their synthetic universe, and these efforts continue. My read so far on DEL screening is that it’s a very useful technique, but (as is always the case) not a magic bullet. People outside of drug discovery always seem to be amazed that we can screen a million compounds and not find something that binds to Target X, and they’d be even more amazed to know that you can run a whole series of DELs, containing (well, most likely) as many compounds as there are people on earth, and still not get a hit, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are also questions that DOS, diversity-oriented synthesis, was designed to help answer. I’ve always had &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/11/11/and_one_was_just_right&quot;&gt;reservations about that concept&lt;/a&gt;, but there have been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio.2420&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30249-0&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; papers that have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066158/&quot;&gt;continued&lt;/a&gt; to come out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392761/&quot;&gt;screening&lt;/a&gt; such collections. You can also see that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5171204/&quot;&gt;synthetic&lt;/a&gt; work &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.7b01776&quot;&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b06994&quot;&gt;reactions&lt;/a&gt; to make more diverse compounds sets feasible. Those papers, and more like them, are uncovered through a PubMed search on “Schreiber SL”, although there are others. One problem, though, is that a search for “diversity oriented synthesis” itself turns up both these papers and a mound of other stuff besides. There are an awful lot of papers that appropriate the term to mean “We made a bunch of stuff because we could and here it is”. The uncharitable view is that’s what the early DOS papers from the Broad added up to as well, but believe me, this other stuff is really the pits. When you see someone banging out a bunch of (say) chalcones and slapping a “diversity-oriented synthesis” label on the resulting work, well, it really makes you roll your eyes. Schreiber must love it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But has the DOS concept caught on outside the Broad Institute? It’s pretty labor-intensive, from a synthetic chemistry standpoint, although it’s designed to minimize that as much as possible once its time to actually make the libraries. But that’s a real “measure twice, cut once” situation; the last thing you want to do is rip into a big library synthesis that generates a bunch of half-made and truncated stuff instead of your desired Land of Diversity. I would like to have a better feel for how this is all working out. It may be that only organizations with significant manpower and funding can make a go of it, and significant bravery/nerve may be a requirement as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now DOS is, in the grand scheme of things, a series of shots into that gigantic chemical space mentioned above, and you could spend a lifetime at it and never make a dent in the number of untested areas – but (as above) is that the relevant question? The current version of it appears to be providing some interesting hits against interesting targets, and what more can you ask? It would be very worthwhile to study the hit rates (and hit quality) of DOS screening as practiced at the Broad versus what comes out of more conventional large compound collections, but if a large-scale comparison of this sort is publicly available, I’ve missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thoughts? How much effort is appropriate to beef up the screening collection, and what kind of return can one expect? Are you better letting the vendors clean out their closets and sell the stuff to you, or trying to make compounds yourself/pay someone to make them? What’s the comparative return on those? And the return versus and investment in DNA-encoded library technology (versus paying someone who does it already?) And does anyone do DOS-like stuff for themselves? Comments welcomed. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_1629b4f6aaf:2b8afa:7c9981b6</id><title>Thoughts on Compound Collections</title><fingerprint>9a337f6e</fingerprint><description>I’ve recently had similar questions from two different people (on two different coasts) about screening collections and compound libraries, so it seems like it could be a topic of interest.

The understanding on the roles of obesity and lifestyle behaviors in predicting executive function of adolescents has been limited. Low executive function proficiency may have adverse effects on adolescents’ school academic performance. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationship between BMI-for-age and multiple lifestyle behaviors (operationalized as meal consumption, physical activity, and sleep quality) with executive function (operationalized as inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) on a sample of Malaysian adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 513). Participants were recruited from two randomly selected schools in the state of Selangor in Malaysia. Using a self-administered questionnaire, parent participants provided information concerning their sociodemographic data, whereas adolescent participants provided information regarding their meal consumptions, physical activity, and sleep quality. The modified Harvard step test was used to assess adolescents’ aerobic fitness, while Stroop color-word, digit span, and trail-making tests were used to assess adolescents’ inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, respectively. Three separate hierarchical regression analyses were conducted for each outcome namely, inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. After adjusted for sociodemographic factors and BMI-for-age, differential predictors of inhibition and working memory were found. Habitual sleep efficiency significantly and positively predicted inhibition. Regular dinner intakes, physical activity levels, and sleep quality significantly and positively predicted working memory. Household income emerged as a consistent predictor for all executive function domains. In conclusion, an increased trend of obesity and unhealthy lifestyles among adolescents were found to be associated with poorer executive function. Regular dinner intakes, higher physical activity levels and better sleep quality predicted better executive function despite the inverse relationship between obesity and executive function. Future studies may explore how lifestyle modifications can optimize the development of executive function in adolescents as well as relieve the burden of obesity.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:334415a:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Obesity and unhealthy lifestyle associated with poor executive function among Malaysian adolescents</title><fingerprint>dac795ec</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joyce Ying Hui Tee, Wan Ying Gan, Kit-Aun Tan, Yit Siew Chin&lt;/p&gt;

Bifidobacteria colonize the human gastrointestinal tract, vagina, oral cavity and breast milk. They influence human physiology and nutrition through health-promoting effects, play an important role as primary colonizers of the newborn gut, and contribute to vaginal microbiome homeostasis by producing lactic acid. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which bifidobacteria are transmitted from mother to infant remains in discussion. Moreover, studies have suggested that &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt; spp. have specializations for gut colonization, but comparisons of strains of the same bifidobacteria species from different body sites are lacking. Here, our objective was to compare the genomes of &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium breve&lt;/i&gt; (n = 17) and &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium longum&lt;/i&gt; (n = 26) to assess whether gut and vaginal isolates of either species were distinguishable based on genome content. Comparison of the general genome features showed that vaginal and gut isolates did not differ in size, GC content, number of genes and CRISPR, either for &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;breve&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longum&lt;/i&gt;. Average nucleotide identity and whole genome phylogeny analysis revealed that vaginal and gut isolates did not cluster separately. Vaginal and gut isolates also had a similar COG (Cluster of Orthologous Group) category distribution. Differences in the accessory genomes between vaginal and gut strains were observed, but were not sufficient to distinguish isolates based on their origin. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the vaginal and gut microbiomes are colonized by a shared community of &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, and further emphasize the potential importance of the maternal vaginal microbiome as a source of infant gut microbiota.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba1:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Bifidobacteria isolated from vaginal and gut microbiomes are indistinguishable by comparative genomics</title><fingerprint>97c0a9ca</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aline C.

Background &lt;p&gt;While links between disability and poverty are well established, there have been few longitudinal studies to clarify direction of causality, particularly among older adults in low and middle income countries. We aimed to study the effect of care dependence among older adult residents on the economic functioning of their households, in catchment area survey sites in Peru, Mexico and China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Households were classified from the evolution of the needs for care of older residents, over two previous community surveys, as ‘incident care’, ‘chronic care’ or ‘no care’, and followed up three years later to ascertain economic outcomes (household income, consumption, economic strain, satisfaction with economic circumstances, healthcare expenditure and residents giving up work or education to care).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Household income did not differ between household groups. However, income from paid work (Pooled Count Ratio pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–1.00) and government transfers (pCR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69–0.93) were lower in care households. Consumption was 12% lower in chronic care households (pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99). Household healthcare expenditure was higher (pCR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26–1.90), and catastrophic healthcare spending more common (pRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.64–2.22) in care households.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While endogeneity cannot be confidently excluded as an explanation for the findings, this study indicates that older people’s needs for care have a discernable impact on household economics, controlling for baseline indicators of long-term economic status. Although living, typically, in multigenerational family units, older people have not featured prominently in global health and development agendas. Population ageing will rapidly increase the number of households where older people live, and their societal significance. Building sustainable long-term care systems for the future will require some combination of improved income security in old age; incentivisation of informal care through compensation for direct and opportunity costs; and development of community care services to support, and, where necessary, supplement or substitute the central role of informal caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793626:7d6c1c1c</id><title>A cohort study of the effects of older adult care dependence upon household economic functioning, in Peru, Mexico and China</title><fingerprint>9d62ddb3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maëlenn M.

These data suggest a model that nsaRNAs locate in sufficient proximity to nuclear genome and leave identifiable genomic footprints, thus revealing the parts of genome proximal to nuclear speckles.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195417</link><updated>1522357200000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195417</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195417</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195417</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1522357200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde39:9f3b30f2</id><title>Correction: SubID, a non-median dichotomization tool for heterogeneous populations, reveals the pan-cancer significance of &amp;lt;i&gt;INPP4B&amp;lt;/i&gt; and its regulation by EVI1 in AML</title><fingerprint>1338c6f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/524/eaal1253?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/524/eaal1253?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science Signaling current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/524/eaal1253?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/524/eaal1253.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Gonnord, P., Angermann, B.

But change in this area is a hard thing to bring about. &lt;em&gt;Biocentury&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biocentury.com/biocentury/regulation/2018-04-12/why-john-ioannidis-says-norm-p-values-should-shift-0005&quot;&gt;a good interview&lt;/a&gt; with someone who can tell you about that, John Ioannidis, of scientific reproducibility fame. He’s recently set off a lot of comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2676503?redirect=true&quot;&gt;with a proposal&lt;/a&gt; to lower the threshold for “significance” to p &amp;lt; 0.005, and as you’d imagine, there are some strong opinions on that. His estimate is that this would shift about a third of the published biomedical results to “suggestive” rather than significant, and his take on this is, basically “good riddance”. According to Ioannidis, a lot of those are false positives anyway, and a lot of the ones that are real are not really useful. Here’s the root of the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: What is the correct way to think about a p-value?&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: A p-value is the probability or the chance that you’ll see a result that is so extreme as the one that you see if the null hypothesis is true and if there is no bias. Many people say a p-value is the chance of the null hypothesis being wrong, of some effect being there. This completely ignores the fact that you have these two ‘ifs’ that are required to interpret the p-value. So it is the chance of seeing such an extreme result, or something even more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true and if we have no bias.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he’s upfront about the fact that his suggested new threshold is not the final answer, but just an interim step towards larger reforms. He wants to see better experimental and trial designs (Bayesian and traditional), larger sample sizes, and more attention paid to potential sources of bias and to effect size. In fact, if people just go wild for the new, stricter p-values, it’ll be a loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: Don’t you have a concern that by moving to a smaller p-value you are reinforcing the fetish about p-values and driving people to create enormous data sets? With data sets that are big enough, you can get very small p-values, but that doesn’t mean the results mean anything.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: Absolutely. And this is why 80% of the literature should not be using p-values, maybe 90% of the literature. With huge amounts of data, with big data, using a p-value means nothing, because everything can be statistically significant at 0.05 or even at 0.005. &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the question is, how do you change the mentality of people who are kind of automatically hooked to using a single magic number? It’s not that the alternative approaches that are better, like using effect size and confidence intervals or using Bayesian statistics, are recent. They have been out there for a long time, but their adoption, even though it is accelerating, has not been what we want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, he thinks that p-value is the right tool for the job about 20% of the time, whereas Bayesian measures could be useful half the time, maybe even more. One instant objection to the idea of lowering p-value cutoffs is that it will make everything much more expensive and time-consuming (clinical trials, first and foremost), but his contention is that it doesn’t have to be that way.

In the field of the social psychology of prejudice, John Duckitt&apos;s Dual-Process Cognitive-Motivational Model of Ideology and Prejudice has gained a firm grounding over the past decade and a half, while empathy has become one of the most powerful predictors of prejudice, alongside right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. This study integrates empathy into the dual-process model, exploring the effects of this variable, along with the impact of personality and ideological attitudes, on prejudice in both its blatant and subtle forms. A cross-sectional research design was used to collect data from 260 university students by self-report measures. Despite its cross-sectional nature, a pattern of causal relationships was hypothesized according to experimental and longitudinal findings from previous studies. The path analysis results show that in the model fitted to the data, empathy does not have any direct impact on prejudice, although it plays a significant role in the prediction of prejudice towards a particular immigrant group. On the other hand, the dual-process model is confirmed in the explanation of blatant prejudice and, in a weaker and indirect way, of subtle prejudice; sustaining the distinctive nature of these constructs on some differential predictors and paths. In the discussion, this study proposes that when ideological and personality-based variables are both included in the model, general empathy is not so robust in the explanation of prejudice, since some of the empathetic components might become diluted among other covariates. But even so, its indirect effectiveness through personality and ideological attitudes remains relevant.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d735:9f3b30f2</id><title>Is empathy one of the Big Three?

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterised by pancreatic beta cell destruction and absolute insulin deficiency. The strongest predictor of diabetes complications is glycaemic control and achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0% is the primary management target. However, standard treatment appears to be lacking and adjunctive strategies require consideration. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effect of low-carbohydrate diets on type 1 diabetes management. Four databases were searched from inception until 28 March 2017: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; and EMBASE. All primary studies containing a methods section (excluding cross-sectional) were included. Reports had to quantitatively measure the effect(s) of a dietary intervention or observed intake over at least two weeks where carbohydrate is below 45% total energy in adults and/or children with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was HbA1c and secondary outcomes were severe hypoglycaemia, total daily insulin, BMI, quality of life and mean daily glucose. Seventy-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and nine were included (two randomised controlled trials, four pre-post interventions, two case-series, one case-report). Eight studies reported a mean change in HbA1c with a low-carbohydrate diet. Of these, four reported a non-significant change (P ≥ 0.05) and three reported statistically significant reductions (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia, five reported total insulin, three reported BMI, and one reported blood glucose. Due to the significant heterogeneity of included studies, an overall effect could not be determined. This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef14:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review</title><fingerprint>30b1893b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica L.

This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0020-7</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0020-7</originId><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0020-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-018-0020-7/MediaObjects/41586_2018_20_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>589</width></visual><unread>True</unread><author><name>Maria João Fernandes Martins</name></author><published>1523430000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>121</engagement><crawled>1523466919412</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;High male sexual investment as a driver of extinction in fossil ostracods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High male sexual investment as a driver of extinction in fossil ostracods, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0020-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0020-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ostracod species (small, bivalved crustaceans) with high sexual dimorphism, and therefore high male investment, had markedly higher extinction rates than low-investment species, indicating that sexual selection can be a substantial risk factor for extinction.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162b5b45df4:731929:7d6c1c1c</id><title>High male sexual investment as a driver of extinction in fossil ostracods</title><fingerprint>1a740687</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;High male sexual investment as a driver of extinction in fossil ostracods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High male sexual investment as a driver of extinction in fossil ostracods, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0020-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0020-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ostracod species (small, bivalved crustaceans) with high sexual dimorphism, and therefore high male investment, had markedly higher extinction rates than low-investment species, indicating that sexual selection can be a substantial risk factor for extinction.</description></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288274v1?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288274v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288274v1?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/288274</canonicalUrl><author><name>Hoyt, C.

Background &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to conduct an indirect treatment comparison between cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel relative to comparators in the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who progress on docetaxel-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the network meta-analysis of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Due to a lack of head-to-head trials, studies with a comparator arm of best supportive care were included in the analysis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events were compared within both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks. The ratios for survival outcomes were estimated using hazard ratios (HR), and the ratios for adverse events between groups were estimated using odds ratios (ORs); uncertainty was reported as 95% confidence (Frequentist) and credible (Baysesian) Intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three of thirteen trials identified for abstraction were relevant for analyses. Median overall survival was not statistically significantly different for abiraterone (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.83–1.28) or enzalutamide (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.69–1.11) when compared to cabazitaxel in the Bayesian analysis. Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01–10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI = 1.41–75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03–10.09) were more likely to occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14–206.40). Frequentist analyses produced similar results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The scarcity of clinical studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles. As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the beneficial effects of these therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d6:34f43e70</id><title>Indirect treatment comparison of cabazitaxel for patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have been previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen</title><fingerprint>1d131747</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jon P.

Background and objective &lt;p&gt;Potential hepatoxicity is an important clinical concern when administering immunosuppressive therapies to patients infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV). Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF) increase the likelihood of hepatitis consequent to HBV reactivation, but reported risks and outcomes vary. We determined the risks of liver enzyme elevation in anti-rheumatic drug users from an HBV-endemic region with differing HBV serostatus.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We established retrospective cohorts with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis who: 1) received anti-TNF agents from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2013; 2) received care from 1 June 2011 to 30 June 2013 but only ever used conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Background and objective &lt;p&gt;Potential hepatoxicity is an important clinical concern when administering immunosuppressive therapies to patients infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV). Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF) increase the likelihood of hepatitis consequent to HBV reactivation, but reported risks and outcomes vary. We determined the risks of liver enzyme elevation in anti-rheumatic drug users from an HBV-endemic region with differing HBV serostatus.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We established retrospective cohorts with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis who: 1) received anti-TNF agents from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2013; 2) received care from 1 June 2011 to 30 June 2013 but only ever used conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Serology results defined three subgroups: HBV surface antigen positive (HBsAg+), HBsAg negative/HBV core antibody positive (HBsAg−/HBcAb+), or uninfected. We compared incidences of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) exceeding twice the upper reference limit between HBV serostatus subgroups in each treatment cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 783 patients treated with anti-TNF (n = 472) or DMARDs only (n = 311), HBsAg−/HBcAb+ anti-TNF users had incidence of ALT elevation commensurate with uninfected counterparts (6.1 vs. 6.0/100 person-years), compared to 19.6/100 person-years in HBsAg+ patients (standardized rate ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.3–8.2); none effected had severe or fatal hepatitis and ALT levels in all HBsAg−/HBcAb+ patients remained stable, mostly normalizing spontaneously, or after moderating treatment.

To unveil novel global changes associated with corpus luteum (CL) maturation, we analyzed transcriptome data for the bovine CL on days 4 and 11, representing the developing vs. mature gland. Our analyses revealed 681 differentially expressed genes (363 and 318 on day 4 and 11, respectively), with ≥2 fold change and FDR of &amp;lt;5%. Different gene ontology (GO) categories were represented prominently in transcriptome data at these stages (e.g. days 4: cell cycle, chromosome, DNA metabolic process and replication and on day 11: immune response; lipid metabolic process and complement activation). Based on bioinformatic analyses, select genes expression in day 4 and 11 CL was validated with quantitative real-time PCR. Cell specific expression was also determined in enriched luteal endothelial and steroidogenic cells. Genes related to the angiogenic process such as &lt;i&gt;NOS3&lt;/i&gt;, which maintains dilated vessels and &lt;i&gt;MMP9&lt;/i&gt;, matrix degrading enzyme, were higher on day 4. Importantly, our data suggests day 11 CL acquire mechanisms to prevent blood vessel sprouting and promote their maturation by expressing &lt;i&gt;NOTCH4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JAG1&lt;/i&gt;, greatly enriched in luteal endothelial cells. Another endothelial specific gene, &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt;, was identified here in the CL for the first time. &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt; is an adhesion molecule enabling lymphocyte migration, its higher levels at mid cycle are expected to support the transmigration of immune cells into the CL at this stage. Together with steroidogenic genes, most of the genes regulating de-novo cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (e.g &lt;i&gt;HMGCS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HMGCR&lt;/i&gt;) and cholesterol uptake from plasma (&lt;i&gt;LDLR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOD&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) were upregulated in the mature CL. These findings provide new insight of the processes involved in CL maturation including blood vessel growth and stabilization, leucocyte transmigration as well as progesterone synthesis as the CL matures.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad281c:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Genomic profiling of bovine corpus luteum maturation</title><fingerprint>98bfe610</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sigal Kfir, Raghavendra Basavaraja, Noa Wigoda, Shifra Ben-Dor, Irit Orr, Rina Meidan&lt;/p&gt;

These findings provide new insight of the processes involved in CL maturation including blood vessel growth and stabilization, leucocyte transmigration as well as progesterone synthesis as the CL matures.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.35</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/R61iNt5U77s/nrd.2018.35</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.35</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Paul Wilcock</name></author><published>1522738800000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.35</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522734245299</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nrd.2018.35-f1.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>514</width></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The gastroesophageal cancer drug market&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gastroesophageal cancer drug market, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.35&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Immune checkpoint inhibitors are forecast to expand the market for gastroesophageal cancer drugs, which is particularly large in Asia.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/R61iNt5U77s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>YLwIhSxZAzQIEnJq1FGGcXUQMCbQUlr9cyNMExMVeyY=_1628a08a5b3:8ff14ff:7d6c1c1c</id><title>The gastroesophageal cancer drug market</title><fingerprint>286c236e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The gastroesophageal cancer drug market&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gastroesophageal cancer drug market, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.35&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Immune checkpoint inhibitors are forecast to expand the market for gastroesophageal cancer drugs, which is particularly large in Asia.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/R61iNt5U77s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5013259?af=R</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5013259?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5013259?af=R</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Fidan Sumbul</name></author><published>1521438157000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88e1:7d6c1c1c</id><title>History, rare, and multiple events of mechanical unfolding of repeat           proteins</title><fingerprint>a1e8abe7</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1464?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1464?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1464?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1464.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Herman-Bausier, P., Dufrene, Y.

Humans are remarkably adept at generalizing knowledge between experiences in a way that can be difficult for computers. Often, this entails generalizing constituent pieces of experiences that do not fully overlap, but nonetheless share useful similarities with, previously acquired knowledge. However, it is often unclear how knowledge gained in one context should generalize to another. Previous computational models and data suggest that rather than learning about each individual context, humans build latent abstract structures and learn to link these structures to arbitrary contexts, facilitating generalization. In these models, task structures that are more popular across contexts are more likely to be revisited in new contexts. However, these models can only re-use policies as a whole and are unable to transfer knowledge about the transition structure of the environment even if only the goal has changed (or vice-versa). This contrasts with ecological settings, where some aspects of task structure, such as the transition function, will be shared between context separately from other aspects, such as the reward function. Here, we develop a novel non-parametric Bayesian agent that forms independent latent clusters for transition and reward functions, affording separable transfer of their constituent parts across contexts. We show that the relative performance of this agent compared to an agent that jointly clusters reward and transition functions depends environmental task statistics: the mutual information between transition and reward functions and the stochasticity of the observations. We formalize our analysis through an information theoretic account of the priors, and propose a meta learning agent that dynamically arbitrates between strategies across task domains to optimize a statistical tradeoff.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X_ZyVI2ySQ4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162df187f34:50ab6:a077e55f</id><title>Compositional clustering in task structure learning</title><fingerprint>124e705e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas T.

After carotid artery stenting, the procurement of information about blood flow redistribution among brain-feeding arteries and its time trend is essential to understanding a patient’s physiological background and to determine their care regimen. Cerebral blood flow has been measured twice following carotid artery stenting in few previous studies, with some discrepancies in the results. The purpose of this study was to measure cerebral blood flow at multiple time points after carotid artery stenting, and to elucidate the time trend of cerebral blood flow and redistribution among arteries. Blood flow rates in 11 subjects were measured preoperatively, at one day, one week, and about three months, respectively after carotid artery stenting by using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. The target vessels were the bilateral internal carotid arteries, the basilar artery, and the bilateral middle cerebral arteries. Lumen was semi-automatically defined using an algorithm utilizing pulsatility. The results showed that blood flow rates in the stented internal carotid artery and the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery increased following carotid artery stenting. Blood flow rates in the contralateral internal carotid artery and the basilar artery gradually declined, and they were lower than the preoperative values at three months after stenting. The sum of blood flow rates of the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery increased after carotid artery stenting, and then decreased over the next three months. There was no significant change in the blood flow rate in the contralateral middle cerebral artery. From these results, it was concluded that redistribution among the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery occurs after carotid artery stenting, and that it takes months thereafter to reach another equilibrium.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd84:9f3b30f2</id><title>Multiple blood flow measurements before and after carotid artery stenting via phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging: An observational study</title><fingerprint>ba541727</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hisashi Tanaka, Yoshiyuki Watanabe, Hajime Nakamura, Hiroto Takahashi, Atsuko Arisawa, Takuya Fujiwara, Chisato Matsuo, Noriyuki Tomiyama&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;With the greatest burden of infant undernutrition and morbidity in low and middle income countries (LMICs), there is a need for suitable approaches to monitor infants in a simple, low-cost and effective manner. Anthropometry continues to play a major role in characterising growth and nutritional status.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a range of models to aid in identifying neonates at risk of malnutrition. We first adopted a logistic regression approach to screen for a composite neonatal morbidity, low and high body fat (BF%) infants. We then developed linear regression models for the estimation of neonatal fat mass as an assessment of body composition and nutritional status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We fitted logistic regression models combining up to four anthropometric variables to predict composite morbidity and low and high BF% neonates. The greatest area under receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUC with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) for identifying composite morbidity was 0.740 (0.63, 0.85), resulting from the combination of birthweight, length, chest and mid-thigh circumferences. The AUCs (95% CI) for identifying low and high BF% were 0.827 (0.78, 0.88) and 0.834 (0.79, 0.88), respectively.For identifying composite morbidity, BF% as measured via air displacement plethysmography showed strong predictive ability (AUC 0.786 (0.70, 0.88)), while birthweight percentiles had a lower AUC (0.695 (0.57, 0.82)). Birthweight percentiles could also identify low and high BF% neonates with AUCs of 0.792 (0.74, 0.85) and 0.834 (0.79, 0.88). We applied a sex-specific approach to anthropometric estimation of neonatal fat mass, demonstrating the influence of the testing sample size on the final model performance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These models display potential for further development and evaluation in LMICs to detect infants in need of further nutritional management, especially where traditional methods of risk management such as birthweight for gestational age percentiles may be variable or non-existent, or unable to detect appropriately grown, low fat newborns.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c56:7d6c1c1c</id><title>An anthropometric approach to characterising neonatal morbidity and body composition, using air displacement plethysmography as a criterion method</title><fingerprint>a54b841f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jacqueline Huvanandana, Angela E.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of acupuncture, sham acupuncture and drugs in the treatment of chronic constipation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of acupuncture and drugs for chronic constipation were comprehensively retrieved from electronic databases (such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP Database and CBM) up to December 2017. Additional references were obtained from review articles. With quality evaluations and data extraction, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using a random-effects model under a frequentist framework. A total of 40 studies (n = 11032) were included: 39 were high-quality studies and 1 was a low-quality study. NMA showed that (1) acupuncture improved the symptoms of chronic constipation more effectively than drugs; (2) the ranking of treatments in terms of efficacy in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome was acupuncture, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, prucalopride, sham acupuncture, tegaserod, and placebo; (3) the ranking of side effects were as follows: lactulose, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol, prucalopride, linaclotide, placebo and tegaserod; and (4) the most commonly used acupuncture point for chronic constipation was ST25. Acupuncture is more effective than drugs in improving chronic constipation and has the least side effects. In the future, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to prove this. Sham acupuncture may have curative effects that are greater than the placebo effect. In the future, it is necessary to perform high-quality studies to support this finding. Polyethylene glycol also has acceptable curative effects with fewer side effects than other drugs.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b1:91749e5b</id><title>Comparison of acupuncture and other drugs for chronic constipation: A network meta-analysis</title><fingerprint>97ca617e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lingping Zhu, Yunhui Ma, Xiaoyan Deng&lt;/p&gt;

A live-bearing reproductive strategy can induce large morphological changes in the mother during pregnancy. The evolution of the placenta in swimming animals involves a shift in the timing of maternal provisioning from pre-fertilization (females supply their eggs with sufficient yolk reserves prior to fertilization) to post-fertilization (females provide all nutrients via a placenta during the pregnancy). It has been hypothesised that this shift, associated with the evolution of the placenta, should confer a morphological advantage to the females leading to a more slender body shape during the early stages of pregnancy. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying three-dimensional shape and volume changes during pregnancy and in full-grown virgin controls of two species within the live-bearing fish family Poeciliidae: &lt;i&gt;Poeciliopsis gracilis&lt;/i&gt; (non-placental) and &lt;i&gt;Poeciliopsis turneri&lt;/i&gt; (placental). We show that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;turneri&lt;/i&gt; is more slender than &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gracilis&lt;/i&gt; at the beginning of the interbrood interval and in virgins, and that these differences diminish towards the end of pregnancy. This study provides the first evidence for an adaptive morphological advantage of the placenta in live-bearing fish. A similar morphological benefit could drive the evolution of placentas in other live-bearing (swimming) animal lineages.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aee:9f3b30f2</id><title>Why do placentas evolve?

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is considered a major worldwide health burden, with high mortality and associated costs. Health indicators are essential to define strategies to improve the treatment of diseases, and the epidemiology information of sepsis in developing countries is scarce. Thus, the aim of this work is to assess trends in the incidence, lethality, costs, and other indicators of sepsis for Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS—&lt;i&gt;Sistema Único de Saúde&lt;/i&gt;) hospitalizations for the period from January 2006 to December 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted this study using data from the SUS hospital information system. We selected registries of SUS hospitalizations of patients diagnosed with sepsis (total of 724,458 cases from 4,271 public and private Brazilian hospitals).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2015, the annual sepsis incidence increased 50.5% from 31.5/100,000 to 47.4/100,000 persons. The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 9.0 days. A total of 29.1% of the hospitalizations had admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a mean ICU LOS of 8.0 days. The mean cost per hospitalization was US$624.0 and for hospitalizations requiring intensive care was U$1,708.1. The overall sepsis lethality rate was 46.3%, and for hospitalizations with admission to the ICU, it was 64.5%. During the study period, the lethality rate for children/teenagers decreased 40.1%, but for all other age groups it increased 11.4%. The sepsis lethality rate in public hospitals (55.5%) was higher than private hospitals (37.0%) (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The mean hospitalization LOS for public hospitals (10.3 days) was higher than private hospitals (7.6 days) (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The incidence and lethality rate of sepsis increased in SUS hospitalizations during the study period.

Background &lt;p&gt;The survival rate of childhood cancer patients increased over the past decades. However, even after successful treatment the transition back to normalcy is often a major challenge for the whole family. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families in the first years after the end of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA Checklist (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017059782). In November 2016 and September 2017, we searched the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, and Web of Science. We included studies investigating psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors diagnosed under the age of 21, their family members or the family as a whole. Further, we summarized the study characteristics and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results. Finally, we assessed the study quality with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 8215 records based on our database searches and 17 additional records through hand searches. We included 33 articles in the qualitative synthesis. Most of the studies described interventions for the cancer survivor (n = 15). Nine studies investigated interventions for the whole family, and two studies interventions for siblings. The interventions mainly take place in an outpatient group setting (n = 15). Overall, most of the studies reported a significant psychosocial benefit of the interventions. However, the quality of the included studies was limited.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In summary, we identified a broad range of different interventions and thus could give a comprehensive overview of existing interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families. However, there is a necessity for high quality studies. The results may help to optimize health care services that support families with the re-entry into daily life.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f78fe:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Psychosocial interventions for rehabilitation and reintegration into daily life of pediatric cancer survivors and their families: A systematic review</title><fingerprint>44fd683a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mona Leandra Peikert, Laura Inhestern, Corinna Bergelt&lt;/p&gt;

Global introductions of aquatic species and their associated pathogens are threatening worldwide biodiversity. The introduction of two North American crayfish species, &lt;i&gt;Procambarus clarkii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pacifastacus leniusculus&lt;/i&gt;, into Japan in 1927 seems to have negatively affected native Japanese crayfish populations of &lt;i&gt;Cambaroides japonicus&lt;/i&gt;. Several studies have shown the decline of these native populations due to competition, predation and habitat colonization by the two invasive North American crayfish species. Here, we identify an additional factor contributing to this decline. We report the first crayfish plague outbreaks in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonicus&lt;/i&gt; populations in Japan, which were diagnosed using both histological and molecular approaches (analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region). Subsequent analyses of the mitochondrial ribosomal rnnS and rnnL regions of diseased specimens indicate that these outbreaks originated from a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt; population and identify a novel haplotype of &lt;i&gt;Aphanomyces astaci&lt;/i&gt;, d3-haplotype, hosted by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt;.

The circuit organization within the mammalian brainstem respiratory network, specifically within and between the pre-Bötzinger (pre-BötC) and Bötzinger (BötC) complexes, and the roles of these circuits in respiratory pattern generation are continuously debated. We address these issues with a combination of optogenetic experiments and modeling studies. We used transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 under the VGAT-promoter to investigate perturbations of respiratory circuit activity by site-specific photostimulation of inhibitory neurons within the pre-BötC or BötC. The stimulation effects were dependent on the intensity and phase of the photostimulation. Specifically: (1) Low intensity (≤ 1.0 mW) pulses delivered to the pre-BötC during inspiration did not terminate activity, whereas stronger stimulations (≥ 2.0 mW) terminated inspiration. (2) When the pre-BötC stimulation ended in or was applied during expiration, rebound activation of inspiration occurred after a fixed latency. (3) Relatively weak sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–2.0 mW) of pre-BötC inhibitory neurons increased respiratory frequency, while a further increase of stimulus intensity (&gt; 3.0 mW) reduced frequency and finally (≥ 5.0 mW) terminated respiratory oscillations. (4) Single pulses (0.2–5.0 s) applied to the BötC inhibited rhythmic activity for the duration of the stimulation. (5) Sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–3.0 mW) of the BötC reduced respiratory frequency and finally led to apnea. We have revised our computational model of pre-BötC and BötC microcircuits by incorporating an additional population of post-inspiratory inhibitory neurons in the pre-BötC that interacts with other neurons in the network. This model was able to reproduce the above experimental findings as well as previously published results of optogenetic activation of pre-BötC or BötC neurons obtained by other laboratories. The proposed organization of pre-BötC and BötC circuits leads to testable predictions about their specific roles in respiratory pattern generation and provides important insights into key circuit interactions operating within brainstem respiratory networks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2-EXg_xghbA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163032286b6:a8a5f:ed160cc3</id><title>Organization of the core respiratory network: Insights from optogenetic and modeling studies</title><fingerprint>3c9cd4af</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica Ausborn, Hidehiko Koizumi, William H.

Background &lt;p&gt;Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are regarded as the cornerstone of conventional treatment for AS. However little is known about concomitant NSAID use during treatment (with TNF-α inhibitors) in daily clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Consecutive patients from the GLAS cohort were included. NSAID use and ASAS-NSAID index were evaluated at group level and at individual patient level during 52 weeks of follow-up. Analyses were stratified for treatment regimen. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to evaluate NSAID use in relation to assessments of disease activity over time. In patients starting TNF-α inhibitors (n = 254), 79% used NSAIDs at baseline and this proportion decreased significantly to 38% at 52 weeks. ASAS-NSAID index also decreased significantly from median 65 to 0. In patients on conventional treatment (n = 139), 74% used NSAIDs at baseline with median ASAS-NSAID index of 50 and this remained stable during follow-up. At each follow-up visit, approximately half of the patients changed their type or dose of NSAIDs. GEE analysis over time showed that NSAID use was associated with AS disease activity score (p&amp;lt;0.05).

Background &lt;p&gt;Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are regarded as the cornerstone of conventional treatment for AS. However little is known about concomitant NSAID use during treatment (with TNF-α inhibitors) in daily clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Consecutive patients from the GLAS cohort were included. NSAID use and ASAS-NSAID index were evaluated at group level and at individual patient level during 52 weeks of follow-up. Analyses were stratified for treatment regimen. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to evaluate NSAID use in relation to assessments of disease activity over time. In patients starting TNF-α inhibitors (n = 254), 79% used NSAIDs at baseline and this proportion decreased significantly to 38% at 52 weeks. ASAS-NSAID index also decreased significantly from median 65 to 0. In patients on conventional treatment (n = 139), 74% used NSAIDs at baseline with median ASAS-NSAID index of 50 and this remained stable during follow-up. At each follow-up visit, approximately half of the patients changed their type or dose of NSAIDs. GEE analysis over time showed that NSAID use was associated with AS disease activity score (p&amp;lt;0.05). This relation was more pronounced in patients treated with TNF-α inhibitors compared to conventional treatment (B = 0.825 vs. B = 0.250).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this observational cohort of established AS patients, there was no difference in baseline NSAID use between patients with and without indication for TNF-α inhibitors. NSAID use decreased significantly after starting TNF-α inhibitors. During conventional treatment, NSAID use remained stable at group level. However, NSAID use changed frequently at individual patient level and was significantly associated with disease activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195359</link><updated>1522789200000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195359</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Fabiana Araújo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195359</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195359</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1522789200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fabiana Araújo, Frank van Oosterhout, Vanessa Becker, José Luiz Attayde, Miquel Lürling&lt;/p&gt;
In tropical and subtropical lakes, eutrophication often leads to nuisance blooms of &lt;i&gt;Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii&lt;/i&gt;. In laboratory experiments, we tested the combined effects of flocculant polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB) on the sinking and growth rates of three &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of PAC and LMB would (1) effectively sink &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; in a test tube experiment and (2) impair &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; growth, irrespective of the biomass of the inoculum (bloom) and the strain in the growth experiment. We tested the recommended (LMB1) and a three-times higher dose of LMB (LMB3). The combined addition of PAC and LMB enhanced the sedimentation of all &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. Moreover, both the PAC and LMB doses decreased the phosphate concentration. PAC and LMB1 decreased the growth rate of all strains, but the efficacy depended on the biomass and strain. The combined addition of PAC and LMB3 inhibited the growth of all strains independently of the biomass and strain. We conclude that a low dose of PAC in combination with the recommended dose of LMB decreases &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; blooms and that the efficiency of the technique depends on the biomass of the bloom.

The presence of Triclosan Methacrylate monomer causes harmful effects at molecular and cellular levels in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mutans&lt;/i&gt;, implying a reduction in the virulence of those microorganisms.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24093-9</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/uL_TXh3w62k/s41598-018-24093-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24093-9</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Mengling Zhang</name></author><published>1523516400000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24093-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523485220395</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: A novel quantitative PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: A novel quantitative PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24093-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24093-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: A novel quantitative PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/uL_TXh3w62k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b6cb9e2b:918ca7:9f3b30f2</id><title>Author Correction: A novel quantitative PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase</title><fingerprint>ca9de9f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: A novel quantitative PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: A novel quantitative PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24093-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24093-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: A novel quantitative PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/uL_TXh3w62k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301036v1?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301036v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301036v1?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/15/301036</canonicalUrl><author><name>Lekschas, F.</name></author><published>1523775600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523826887336</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>We present Scalable Insets, a technique for interactively exploring and navigating large numbers of annotated patterns in multiscale visual spaces such as gigapixel images, matrices, or maps.

Background &lt;p&gt;The molecular characterization of endometrial cancer (EC) can facilitate identification of various tumor subtypes. Although EC patients with &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations reproducibly demonstrate better prognosis, the outcome of patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) remains controversial. This study attempted to interrogate whether genetic stratification of EC can identify distinct subsets with prognostic significance.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A cohort of 138 EC patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent was enrolled. Sanger sequencing was used to evaluate mutations in the &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; genes. MSI analysis was performed using four mononucleotide repeat markers and methylation status of the &lt;i&gt;MLH1&lt;/i&gt; promoter was measured by a fluorescent bisulfite polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Protein expression for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Extensive hypermethylation of the &lt;i&gt;MLH1&lt;/i&gt; promoter was observed in 69.6% ECs with MLH1 deficiency and 3.5% with MMR proficiency, but in none of the ECs with loss of other MMR genes (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .0001). MSI-positive and &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations were found in 29.0% and 8.7% EC patients, respectively. Our MSI analysis showed a sensitivity of 92.7% for EC patients with MMR deficiency, and a specificity of 97.9% for EC patients with MMR proficiency. In univariate and multivariate analyses, &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations and &lt;i&gt;MSI&lt;/i&gt; status was significantly associated with progression-free survival (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0129 and 0.0064, respectively) but not with endometrial cancer-specific survival.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study provides significant evidence that analyses of proofreading &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations and MSI status based on mononucleotide repeat markers are potentially useful biomarkers to identify EC patients with better prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ada:9f3b30f2</id><title>Clinical impact of endometrial cancer stratified by genetic mutational profiles, &amp;lt;i&gt;POLE&amp;lt;/i&gt; mutation, and microsatellite instability</title><fingerprint>59e4e37f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoko Haruma, Takeshi Nagasaka, Keiichiro Nakamura, Junko Haraga, Akihiro Nyuya, Takeshi Nishida, Ajay Goel, Hisashi Masuyama, Yuji Hiramatsu&lt;/p&gt;

Since the shooting of Black teenager Michael Brown by White police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, the protest hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has amplified critiques of extrajudicial killings of Black Americans. In response to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted #AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis of over 860,000 tweets, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse. We find that #AllLivesMatter facilitates opposition between #BlackLivesMatter and hashtags such as #PoliceLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter in such a way that historically echoes the tension between Black protesters and law enforcement. In addition, we show that a significant portion of #AllLivesMatter use stems from hijacking by #BlackLivesMatter advocates. Beyond simply injecting #AllLivesMatter with #BlackLivesMatter content, these hijackers use the hashtag to directly confront the counter-protest notion of “All lives matter.” Our findings suggest that Black Lives Matter movement was able to grow, exhibit diverse conversations, and avoid derailment on social media by making discussion of counter-protest opinions a central topic of #AllLivesMatter, rather than the movement itself.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccaf:34f43e70</id><title>Divergent discourse between protests and counter-protests: #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter</title><fingerprint>9795cd16</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryan J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of learning and memory impairments remains a challenge. Recent investigations have shown that the activation of group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) in cultured hippocampal neurons by application of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) causes the regulated internalization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which subsequently activates protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Through phosphorylating the C-terminals of the NMDAR GluN2 subunits, PKD1 down-regulates the activity of remaining (non-internalized) surface NMDARs. The knockdown of PKD1 does not affect the DHPG-induced inhibition of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) but prevents the DHPG-induced inhibition of NMDAR-mediated mEPSCs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, we investigated the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; effects of bilateral infusions of DHPG into the hippocampal CA1 area of rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object discrimination (NOD) tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 300 adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250–280 g) were used for behavioral tests. One hundred ninety four were used in MWM test and the other 106 rats in the NOD test. Following one week of habituation to the vivarium, rats were bilaterally implanted under deep anesthesia with cannulas aimed at the CA1 area of the hippocampus (CA1 coordinates in mm from Bregma: AP -3.14; lateral +/-2; DV -3.0). Through implanted cannulas artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), the group1 mGluR antagonist 6-Methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), the dynamin-dependent internalization inhibitor Dynasore, or the PKD1 inhibitor CID755673 were infused into the bilateral hippocampal CA1 areas (2 μL per side, over 5 min).

Background &lt;p&gt;The clinical features of postoperative delirium are similar to the core features of alpha synuclein-related cognitive disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Therefore, we hypothesized that the non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), which precede the cardinal motor features of PD, are likely to be risk factors for developing postoperative delirium. We investigated the association between PD-related NMSs and postoperative delirium in old people undergoing elective spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective study. Participants were aged 65 years and older and scheduled to undergo elective spinal surgery. During the enrollment period, 338 individuals were screened, 104 participants were included in the analysis. We assessed eight easily-assessed and representative PD-related NMSs 1 day before the scheduled surgery using tests or questionnaires for each symptom. The presence of delirium was determined by using the short version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Fifteen (14.4%) of the 104 participants (age, 71.7 ± 4.7 years; men, 34.6%) met the CAM criteria for post-operative delirium. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that decreased olfactory function (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.44–0.91) and exhibiting rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD, OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09–1.93) were significantly independent predictors of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study shows that hyposmia and RBD are significantly independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in general elderly population. Considering that NMSs may represent burden of alpha synuclein deposit, we postulate that an underlying alpha synucleinopathy may correlates with postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Significance &lt;p&gt;This study gives a novel insight for the risk factor of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a3:9aea0a7d</id><title>Parkinson&apos;s disease-related non-motor features as risk factors for post-operative delirium in spinal surgery</title><fingerprint>217a9dd7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ki Hoon Kim, Suk Yun Kang, Dong Ah Shin, Seong Yi, Yoon Ha, Keung Nyun Kim, Young Ho Sohn, Phil Hyu Lee&lt;/p&gt;

This study explores the association between specific insomnia symptoms (sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early morning awakenings symptoms) and self-efficacy (perceived self-confidence in the ability to use CPAP) with CPAP compliance in French patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of CPAP compliance in a cohort of 404 patients diagnosed with OSAS. Patients completed mailed questionnaires on sleepiness (ESS), insomnia (ISI) and self-efficacy in sleep apnea (SEMSA). Linear regression modeling analyses were performed to explore the impact of measured variables on the number of hours of CPAP use. Of the initial pool of 404 patients, 288 returned the questionnaires (71% response rate). Their mean age was 63.16±12.73 yrs, 31% were females, mean BMI was 30.39±6.31 kg/m2, mean daily CPAP use was 6.19±2.03 h, mean number of years of use was 6.58±6.03 yrs, and mean initial AHI before CPAP use was 34.61±20.71 /h. Age (p&amp;lt;0.01), BMI (p&amp;lt;0.01), sleep onset insomnia symptoms (p&amp;lt;0.01), sleep maintenance insomnia symptoms (p&amp;lt;0.01) and self-efficacy (p&amp;lt;0.01) were significantly associated with mean daily CPAP use.

This affects many analyses that need such index as an essential step for approximate matching of the NGS reads to reference databases. For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis, the size of the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single full- text index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing such index takes about one day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices are rarely performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing while preserving fast search times. Results: To solve the index construction and update problem we propose the DREAM (Dynamic seaRchablE pArallel coMpressed index) framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the introduction of an approximate search distributor directories via a novel use of Bloom filters. We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and use this new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases where they cannot match.

This affects many analyses that need such index as an essential step for approximate matching of the NGS reads to reference databases. For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis, the size of the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single full- text index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing such index takes about one day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices are rarely performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing while preserving fast search times. Results: To solve the index construction and update problem we propose the DREAM (Dynamic seaRchablE pArallel coMpressed index) framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the introduction of an approximate search distributor directories via a novel use of Bloom filters. We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and use this new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases where they cannot match. This allows us to keep the databases in several indices which can be easily rebuilt if parts are updated while maintaining a fast search time. The second main contribution is an implementation of DREAM-Yara a distributed version of a fully sensitive read mapper under the DREAM framework.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</link><updated>1522875600000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Hanna Gertz</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1522875600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Gertz, Katja Fiehler, Dimitris Voudouris&lt;/p&gt;
It has been suggested that tactile signals are suppressed on a moving limb to free capacities for processing other relevant sensory signals. In line with this notion, we recently showed that tactile suppression is indeed stronger in the presence of reach-relevant somatosensory signals. Here we examined whether this effect also generalizes to the processing of additional visual signals during reaching. Brief vibrotactile stimuli were presented on the participants’ right index finger either during right-hand reaching to a previously illuminated target LED, or during rest. Participants had to indicate whether they detected the vibrotactile stimulus or not. The target LED remained off (&lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt;), or was briefly illuminated (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt;) during reaching, providing additional reach-relevant visual information about the target position. If tactile suppression frees capacities for &lt;i&gt;reach-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual information, suppression should be stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt; condition. In an additional visual-discrimination condition (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt;), the target LED flashed once or twice during reaching and participants had to also report the number of flashes. If tactile suppression occurs to free additional capacities for &lt;i&gt;perception-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual signals, tactile suppression should be even stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; condition. We found that additional visual signals improved reach endpoint accuracy and precision. In all conditions, reaching led to tactile suppression as indicated by higher detection thresholds compared to rest, confirming previous findings. However, tactile suppression was comparable between conditions arguing against the hypothesis that it frees capacities for processing other relevant visual signals.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57601:34f43e70</id><title>The role of visual processing on tactile suppression</title><fingerprint>ba854dbd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Gertz, Katja Fiehler, Dimitris Voudouris&lt;/p&gt;

Land managers increasingly rely upon landscape assessments to understand the status of natural resources and identify conservation priorities. Many of these landscape planning efforts rely on geospatial models that characterize the ecological integrity of the landscape. These general models utilize measures of habitat disturbance and human activity to map indices of ecological integrity. We built upon these modeling frameworks by developing a Landscape Integrity Index (&lt;i&gt;LII&lt;/i&gt;) model using geospatial datasets of the human footprint, as well as incorporation of other indicators of ecological integrity such as biodiversity and vegetation departure. Our &lt;i&gt;LII&lt;/i&gt; model serves as a general indicator of ecological integrity in a regional context of human activity, biodiversity, and change in habitat composition. We also discuss the application of the &lt;i&gt;LII&lt;/i&gt; framework in two related coarse-filter landscape conservation approaches to expand the size and connectedness of protected areas as regional mitigation for anticipated land-use changes.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f58:34f43e70</id><title>Development of a landscape integrity model framework to support regional conservation planning</title><fingerprint>4ee655d6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leroy J.

The origin of the machinery that realizes protein biosynthesis in all organisms is still unclear. One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states. The one unifying aspect of both classes is their function of binding ATP. We identified Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers as most compact ATP binding motifs characteristic for each Class. Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures. Regarding the origin of aaRS, the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis states that the peculiar nature of the two aaRS classes is the result of their primordial forms, called Protozymes, being encoded on opposite strands of the same gene. Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes. Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZqNwxiUByA0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d3:bdf8aaf1</id><title>Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers delineate Class I and Class II aminoacyl tRNA synthetases</title><fingerprint>545f066f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Kaiser, Sebastian Bittrich, Sebastian Salentin, Christoph Leberecht, V.

There is a suspected but unproven association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mental health. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and subjective stress, depressive disorders, health-related quality of life (QoL) and suicide. We selected 124,205 adults from the Korean Community Health Survey in 2013 who were at least 19 years old and who had lived in their current domiciles for &gt; five years. Based on the computer-assisted personal interviews to measure subjective stress in daily life, EuroQoL-5 dimensions, depression diagnosis by a doctor, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts, we evaluated the risk of mental disorders using multiple logistic regression analysis according to the quartiles of air pollutants, such as particulate matter &amp;lt;10μm (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide, using yearly average concentration between August 2012 and July 2013. The prevalence of high stress, poor QoL, depressiveness, diagnosis of depression, and suicide ideation was positively associated with high concentrations of PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO after adjusting for confounding factors. Men were at increased risk of stress, poor QoL, and depressiveness from air pollution exposure than were women. The risk of higher stress or poor QoL in subjects &amp;lt; age 65 increased with air pollution more than did that in subjects ≥ age 65. Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution may be an independent risk factor for mental health disorders ranging from subjective stress to suicide ideation.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529c:9aea0a7d</id><title>Long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and mental health status: A nationwide population-based cross-sectional study</title><fingerprint>ee5a65b4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinyoung Shin, Jin Young Park, Jaekyung Choi&lt;/p&gt;

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing dietary fish oil (FO) with palm oil (PO) in juvenile Nile tilapia, &lt;i&gt;Oreochromis niloticus&lt;/i&gt; (9.34± 0.02g initial weight) with emphasis on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities as well as serum biochemical parameters. Also, lysozyme activity (LYZ), respiratory burst (RB), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and resistance to &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus iniae&lt;/i&gt; were investigated. Fish were stocked in 15 rectangular fiber glass tanks (150× 60× 40 cm) at 40 fish per tank with water maintained at 210 litres. Fish were fed five isonitrogenous (33% crude protein) and isolipidic (10% lipid) diets with PO included at 0% (0% PO), 25% (25% PO), 50% (50%PO), 75% (75% PO) and 100% (100% PO) for 8 weeks. The findings demonstrated that growth, and feed utilization was not compromised when PO was used in place of FO either partially or totally. Except for protease activity which was not significantly altered, lipase and amylase activities were significantly altered when FO was replaced with PO. There were no significant differences among treatments for CAT, SOD and LYZ. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) in fish fed 100% PO was significantly lower than all other groups whiles total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of fish fed 0% PO was significantly higher than all other groups. Fish fed 0% PO, 25% PO and 50% PO had glutathione reductase (GR) significantly higher than fish fed 75% PO and 100% PO. RB in fish fed 0% PO were significantly lower than fish fed 75% PO and 100% PO. Also, fish fed 0% PO had significantly lower total protein (TP) compared with groups fed 50% PO and 75% PO. Fish fed diets with PO had similar resistance ability to &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus iniae&lt;/i&gt; as those fed diets with FO. However, the liver function was likely to be compromised due to the increase in aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatas (ALP) along increasing PO inclusion levels. AST, total protein, triacylglycerol (TAG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly higher (p&amp;lt;0.05) in groups fed higher levels of PO. This study therefore concludes that feeding tilapia fingerlings with diets containing PO affects antioxidant and innate immune parameters negatively due to the reduction in LYS, TAC, GR, MDA, CAT, SOD and GSHpx.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67af:91749e5b</id><title>Replacement of fish oil with palm oil: Effects on growth performance, innate immune response, antioxidant capacity and disease resistance in Nile tilapia (&amp;lt;i&gt;Oreochromis niloticus&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><fingerprint>24e02b8f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Larbi Ayisi, Jinliang Zhao, Jun-Wei Wu&lt;/p&gt;
This study was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing dietary fish oil (FO) with palm oil (PO) in juvenile Nile tilapia, &lt;i&gt;Oreochromis niloticus&lt;/i&gt; (9.34± 0.02g initial weight) with emphasis on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities as well as serum biochemical parameters. Also, lysozyme activity (LYZ), respiratory burst (RB), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and resistance to &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus iniae&lt;/i&gt; were investigated. Fish were stocked in 15 rectangular fiber glass tanks (150× 60× 40 cm) at 40 fish per tank with water maintained at 210 litres. Fish were fed five isonitrogenous (33% crude protein) and isolipidic (10% lipid) diets with PO included at 0% (0% PO), 25% (25% PO), 50% (50%PO), 75% (75% PO) and 100% (100% PO) for 8 weeks.

&lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; is the causative agent of melioidosis and regarded as a bioterrorism threat. It can adapt to the nutrient-limited environment as the bacteria can survive in triple distilled water for 16 years. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; exhibits intrinsic resistance to diverse groups of antibiotics in particular while growing in biofilms. Recently, nutrient-limited condition influenced both biofilm formation and ceftazidime (CAZ) tolerance of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; were found. However, there is no information about how nutrient-limitation together with antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment affects the structure of the biofilm produced by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, no comparative study to investigate the biofilm architectures of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and the related &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; under different nutrient concentrations has been reported. Therefore, this study aims to provide new information on the effects of four antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;. ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IMI), meropenem (MEM) and doxycycline (DOX) on biofilm architecture of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; with different nutrient concentrations under static and flow conditions using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Impact of nutritional stress on drug susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; grown planktonically or as biofilm was also evaluated. The findings of this study indicate that nutrient-limited environment enhanced survival of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm after exposure to the tested antibiotics. The shedding planktonic &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; were also found to have increased CAZ tolerance in nutrient-limited environment. However, killing activities of MEM and IMI were stronger than CAZ and DOX on &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; both in planktonic cells and in 2-day old biofilm. In addition, MEM and IMI were able to inhibit &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; biofilm formation to a larger extend compared to CAZ and DOX. Differences in biofilm architecture were observed for biofilms grown under static and flow conditions. Under static conditions, biofilms grown in full strength modified Vogel and Bonner’s medium (MVBM) showed honeycomb-like architecture while a knitted-like structure was observed under limited nutrient condition (0.1×MVBM). Under flow conditions, biofilms grown in MVBM showed a multilayer structure while merely dispersed bacteria were found when grown in 0.1×MVBM. Altogether, this study provides more insight on the effect of four antibiotics against &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm under different nutrient and flow conditions. Since biofilm formation is believed to be involved in disease relapse, MEM and IMI may be better therapeutic options than CAZ for melioidosis treatment.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626374dad7:5af0ae4:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Impact of nutritional stress on drug susceptibility and biofilm structures of &amp;lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;Burkholderia thailandensis&amp;lt;/i&gt; grown in static and microfluidic systems</title><fingerprint>da2818f0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chitchanok Anutrakunchai, Jan G.

Transgenic rat models of Alzheimer’s disease were used to examine differences in memory and brain histology. Double transgenic female rats (APP+PS1) over-expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) and single transgenic rats (APP21) over-expressing human APP were compared with wild type Fischer rats (WT). The Barnes maze assessed learning and memory and showed that both APP21 and APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors than the WT rats during the acquisition phase, signifying slower learning. Additionally, the APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors following a retention interval, indicating impaired memory compared to both the APP21 and WT rats. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody against amyloid-β (Aβ) showed extensive and mostly diffuse Aβ plaques in the hippocampus and dense plaques that contained tau in the cortex of the brains of the APP+PS1 rats. Furthermore, the APP+PS1 rats also showed vascular changes, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy with extensive Aβ deposits in cortical and leptomeningeal blood vessel walls and venous collagenosis. In addition to the Aβ accumulation observed in arterial, venous, and capillary walls, APP+PS1 rats also displayed enlarged blood vessels and perivascular space. Overall, the brain histopathology and behavioral assessment showed that the APP+PS1 rats demonstrated behavioral characteristics and vascular changes similar to those commonly observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd8e:9f3b30f2</id><title>Memory deficiency, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and amyloid-β plaques in APP+PS1 double transgenic rat model of Alzheimer’s disease</title><fingerprint>82314836</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Klakotskaia, Cansu Agca, Rachel A.

The development of such an aligner, called FAMOUS (Fast Approximate string Matching using OptimUm search Schemes), is ongoing as our future work.</description></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022006?af=R</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022006?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022006?af=R</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>S.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to discover new cell types by detecting sub-populations in a heterogeneous group of cells. Since scRNA-seq experiments have lower read coverage/tag counts and introduce more technical biases compared to bulk RNA-seq experiments, the limited number of sampled cells combined with the experimental biases and other dataset specific variations presents a challenge to cross-dataset analysis and discovery of relevant biological variations across multiple cell populations. In this paper, we introduce a method of variance-driven multitask clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data (scVDMC) that utilizes multiple single-cell populations from biological replicates or different samples. scVDMC clusters single cells in multiple scRNA-seq experiments of similar cell types and markers but varying expression patterns such that the scRNA-seq data are better integrated than typical pooled analyses which only increase the sample size. By controlling the variance among the cell clusters within each dataset and across all the datasets, scVDMC detects cell sub-populations in each individual experiment with shared cell-type markers but varying cluster centers among all the experiments. Applied to two real scRNA-seq datasets with several replicates and one large-scale droplet-based dataset on three patient samples, scVDMC more accurately detected cell populations and known cell markers than pooled clustering and other recently proposed scRNA-seq clustering methods. In the case study applied to in-house Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) scRNA-seq data, scVDMC revealed several new cell types and unknown markers validated by flow cytometry.

Succulent cacti (Cactaceae) are among the most threatened taxonomic groups assessed to date. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity and population structure of a narrow endemic columnar cactus &lt;i&gt;Pilosocereus aureispinus&lt;/i&gt;. This species is only found in a small area of c. 300 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of rocky savanna from eastern Brazil and it is currently classified as vulnerable (VU) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Eight microsatellite loci were genotyped for 91 individuals from four localities of the known &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt; range. In contrast with expectations for narrow endemic species, we found relatively high levels of genetic diversity (e.g., &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.390 to 0.525; &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.394 to 0.572) and very low population structure based on the variation of six loci. All the analyzed individuals were clustered in one unique genetic group in assignment tests. We also generated the sequences of two plastid markers (&lt;i&gt;trnT-trnL&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;psbD-trnT&lt;/i&gt;) and found no variation on a subsample of 39 individuals. We used Landsat 8 images and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to estimate a potential extent of occurrence of c. 750 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for this species. Our results showed that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt; is not suffering from erosion of nuclear genetic variability due to its narrow distribution. However, we advocate that because of the extremely limited extent of occurrence, the ongoing anthropogenic disturbances in its habitat, and phylogenetic distinctiveness of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt;, this species should be classified as endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171528f:9aea0a7d</id><title>Weak population structure and no genetic erosion in &amp;lt;i&gt;Pilosocereus aureispinus&amp;lt;/i&gt;: A microendemic and threatened cactus species from eastern Brazil</title><fingerprint>17926bea</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gulzar Khan, Paulianny M.

Human protection policies require favorable risk–benefit judgments prior to launch of clinical trials. For phase I and II trials, evidence for such judgment often stems from preclinical efficacy studies (PCESs). We undertook a systematic investigation of application materials (investigator brochures [IBs]) presented for ethics review for phase I and II trials to assess the content and properties of PCESs contained in them. Using a sample of 109 IBs most recently approved at 3 institutional review boards based at German Medical Faculties between the years 2010–2016, we identified 708 unique PCESs. We then rated all identified PCESs for their reporting on study elements that help to address validity threats, whether they referenced published reports, and the direction of their results. Altogether, the 109 IBs reported on 708 PCESs. Less than 5% of all PCESs described elements essential for reducing validity threats such as randomization, sample size calculation, and blinded outcome assessment. For most PCESs (89%), no reference to a published report was provided. Only 6% of all PCESs reported an outcome demonstrating no effect. For the majority of IBs (82%), all PCESs were described as reporting positive findings. Our results show that most IBs for phase I/II studies did not allow evaluators to systematically appraise the strength of the supporting preclinical findings. The very rare reporting of PCESs that demonstrated no effect raises concerns about potential design or reporting biases. Poor PCES design and reporting thwart risk–benefit evaluation during ethical review of phase I/II studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Lvi8iDwsCE0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e7:76251cdd</id><title>Preclinical efficacy studies in investigator brochures: Do they enable risk–benefit assessment?</title><fingerprint>b9fd27d5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Wieschowski, William Wei Lim Chin, Carole Federico, Sören Sievers, Jonathan Kimmelman, Daniel Strech&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allylmercapto-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine (ASSNAC) was shown in our previous study to activate Nrf2-mediated processes and increase glutathione level and resistance to oxidative stress in cultured endothelial cells. In this study, we explored the antioxidant protective effect of ASSNAC in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans)&lt;/i&gt;. Treatment of &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter strain (CL2166) with increasing concentrations of ASSNAC (0.2 to 20 mM) for 24 hours and with ASSNAC (10 mM) for various time periods demonstrated a significant concentration- and time-dependent increase in Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene expression (up to 60-fold at 20 mM after 24 hours). In addition, ASSNAC (2 mM; 24 hours) treatment of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; strains N2 (wild type strain), &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter (CL2166) and temperature sensitive sterile strain (CF512) significantly increased GST enzyme activity by 1.9-, 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively. ASSNAC (2.0 mM; 24 hours) increased the reduced glutathione content in N2 and CF512 strains by 5.9- and 4.9-fold, respectively. Exposure of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; (N2 strain) to a lethal concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.5 mM; 120 min) resulted in death of 88% of the nematodes while pretreatment with ASSNAC (24 hours) reduced nematodes death in a concentration-dependent manner down to 8% at 2.0 mM. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes (strain CF512) cultured on agar plates containing ASSNAC (0.5 to 5.0 mM) demonstrated a significant increase in lifespan compared to control (mean lifespan 26.45 ± 0.64 versus 22.90 ± 0.59 days; log-rank p ≤ 0.001 at 2.0 mM) with a maximal lifespan of 40 versus 36 days. In conclusion, ASSNAC up-regulates the GST gene expression and enzyme activity as well as the glutathione content in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes and thereby increases their resistance to oxidative stress and extends their lifespan.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f9:7d6c1c1c</id><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;S&amp;lt;/i&gt;-allylmercapto-&amp;lt;i&gt;N&amp;lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine protects against oxidative stress and extends lifespan in &amp;lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>4b507ec5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naphtali Savion, Amir Levine, Shlomo Kotev-Emeth, Ulrike Bening Abu-Shach, Limor Broday&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity after acute coronary syndrome compared to patients without prior multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multicenter prospective cohort study in Switzerland included 5,635 patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome between 2009 and 2014, with a one-year follow-up period. We defined cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity as having at least two prior comorbidities before the index hospitalization. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional models were built to assess the one-year risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, defined as cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke. The final model was adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, tobacco consumption, education, and family history of cardiovascular disease, prescription of high-dose statinsat discharge and use of cardiac rehabilitation after discharge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 3,664 patients (65%) had no multimorbidity, 1,839 (33%) had cardiovascular multimorbidity, 62 (1%) had non-cardiovascular multimorbidity, and 70 (1%) had both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity. The multivariate risk of recurrent cardiovascular events was increased among patients with cardiovascular multimorbidity (hazard ratio (HR) 2.05, 95% CI: 1.54–2.73, p&amp;lt;0.001) and patients with non-cardiovascular multimorbidity (HR 2.57, 95% CI: 1.04–6.35, p = 0.04) compared to patients without multimorbidity. Patients with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity had the highest risk of recurrence with a HR of 5.19, 95% CI: 2.79–9.64, p&amp;lt;0.001, compared to patients without multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Multimorbidity increased by two-fold the risk of cardiovascular events over the year after an acute coronary syndrome.

Fossils entombed in amber are a unique resource for reconstructing forest ecosystems, and resolving relationships of modern taxa. Such fossils are famous for their perfect, life-like appearance. However, preservation quality is vast with many sites showing only cuticular preservation, or no fossils. The taphonomic processes that control this range are largely unknown; as such, we know little about potential bias in this important record. Here we employ actualistic experiments, using, fruit flies and modern tree resin to determine whether resin type, gut microbiota, and dehydration prior to entombment affects decay. We used solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) to confirm distinct tree resin chemistry; gut microbiota of flies was modified using antibiotics and categorized though sequencing. Decay was assessed using phase contrast synchrotron tomography. Resin type demonstrates a significant control on decay rate. The composition of the gut microbiota was also influential, with minor changes in composition affecting decay rate. Dehydration prior to entombment, contrary to expectations, enhanced decay. Our analyses show that there is potential significant bias in the amber fossil record, especially between sites with different resin types where ecological completeness and preservational fidelity are likely affected.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d737:9f3b30f2</id><title>Unlocking preservation bias in the amber insect fossil record through experimental decay</title><fingerprint>ffaa2250</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Victoria E.

Offspring survival is generally more variable than adult survival and may limit population growth. Although white-tailed deer neonate survival has been intensively investigated, recent work has emphasized how specific cover types influence neonate survival at local scales (single study area). These localized investigations have often led to inconsistences within the literature. Developing specific hypotheses describing the relationships among environmental, habitat, and landscape factors influencing white-tailed deer neonate survival at regional scales may allow for detection of generalized patterns. Therefore, we developed 11 hypotheses representing the various effects of environmental (e.g., winter and spring weather), habitat (e.g., hiding and escape cover types), and landscape factors (e.g., landscape configuration regardless of specific cover type available) on white-tailed deer neonate survival up to one-month and from one- to three-months of age. At one-month, surviving fawns experienced a warmer lowest recorded June temperature and more June precipitation than those that perished. At three-months, patch connectance (percent of patches of the corresponding patch type that are connected within a predefined distance) positively influenced survival. Our results are consistent with white-tailed deer neonate ecology: increased spring temperature and precipitation are likely associated with a flush of nutritional resources available to the mother, promoting increased lactation efficiency and neonate growth early in life. In contrast, reduced spring temperature with increased precipitation place neonates at risk to hypothermia. Increased patch connectance likely reflects increased escape cover available within a neonate’s home range after they are able to flee from predators. If suitable escape cover is available on the landscape, then managers could focus efforts towards manipulating landscape configuration (patch connectance) to promote increased neonate survival while monitoring spring weather to assess potential influences on current year survival.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4605:34f43e70</id><title>Weather and landscape factors affect white-tailed deer neonate survival at ecologically important life stages in the Northern Great Plains</title><fingerprint>2ecedc0e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric S.

Polyploidization has played an important role in the evolution of vertebrates, particularly at the base of Teleostei–an enormously successful ray-finned fish group with additional genome doublings on lower taxonomic levels. The investigation of post-polyploid genome dynamics might provide important clues about the evolution and ecology of respective species and can help to decipher the role of polyploidy &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on speciation. Few studies have attempted to investigate the dynamics of repetitive DNA sequences in the post-polyploid genome using molecular cytogenetic tools in fishes, though recent efforts demonstrated their usefulness. The demonstrably monophyletic freshwater loach family Botiidae, branching to evolutionary diploid and tetraploid lineages separated &gt;25 Mya, offers a suited model group for comparing the long-term repetitive DNA evolution. For this, we integrated phylogenetic analyses with cytogenetical survey involving Giemsa- and Chromomycin A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)/DAPI stainings and fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization with 5S/45S rDNA, U2 snDNA and telomeric probes in representative sample of 12 botiid species.
The karyotypes of all diploids were composed of 2n = 50 chromosomes, while majority of tetraploids had 2n = 4x = 100, with only subtle interspecific karyotype differences. The exceptional karyotype of &lt;i&gt;Botia dario&lt;/i&gt; (2n = 4x = 96) suggested centric fusions behind the 2n reduction. Variable patterns of FISH signals revealed cases of intraspecific polymorphisms, rDNA amplification, variable degree of correspondence with CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and almost no phylogenetic signal. In tetraploids, either additivity or loci gain/loss was recorded. Despite absence of classical interstitial telomeric sites, large blocks of interspersed rDNA/telomeric regions were found in diploids only.
We uncovered different molecular drives of studied repetitive DNA classes within botiid genomes as well as the advanced stage of the re-diploidization process in tetraploids. Our results may contribute to link genomic approach with molecular cytogenetic analyses in addressing the origin and mechanism of this polyploidization event.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4255:9f3b30f2</id><title>Dynamics of tandemly repeated DNA sequences during evolution of diploid and tetraploid botiid loaches (Teleostei: Cobitoidea: Botiidae)</title><fingerprint>b6e8f653</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandr Sember, Jörg Bohlen, Vendula Šlechtová, Marie Altmanová, Šárka Pelikánová, Petr Ráb&lt;/p&gt;

Open-cut coal mining in Queensland results in the formation of extensive saline overburden spoil-piles with steep slopes at the angle of repose (approximately 75% or 37&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;). These spoil-piles are generally found in multiple rows, several kilometers in length and heights of up to 50 or 60 m above the original landscape. They are highly dispersive and erodible. Legislation demands that these spoil piles be rehabilitated to minimize on-site and off-site discharges of sediment and salt into the surrounding environment. To achieve this, the steep slopes must be reduced, stabilized against erosion, covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. Key design criteria (slope gradient, slope length and vegetation cover) are required for the construction of post-mining landscapes that will result in acceptable erosion rates.
A novel user-friendly hillslope computer model MINErosion 3.4 was developed that can accurately predict potential erosion rates from field scale hillslopes using parameters measured with a 3m laboratory tilting flume-rainfall simulator or using routinely measured soil physical and chemical properties. This model links MINErosion 2 with a novel consolidation and above ground vegetation cover factors, to the RUSLE and MUSLE equations to predict the mean annual and storm event erosion rates. The RUSLE-based prediction of the mean annual erosion rates allow minesites to derive the key design criteria of slope length, slope gradient and vegetation cover that would lead to acceptable erosion rates. The MUSLE-based prediction of storm event erosion rates will be useful as input into risk analysis of potential damage from erosion.
MINErosion 3.4 was validated against erosion measured on 20 m field erosion plots established on post-mining landscapes at the Oakey Creek and Curragh coalmines, as well as on 120 and 70 m erosion plots on postmining landscapes at Kidston Gold Mine.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2817:7d6c1c1c</id><title>MINErosion 3: Using measurements on a tilting flume-rainfall simulator facility to predict erosion rates from post-mining landscapes in Central Queensland, Australia</title><fingerprint>929e6cd3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hwat Bing So, Ashraf M.

Networks in nature rarely function in isolation but instead interact with one another with a form of a network of networks (NoN). A network of networks with interdependency between distinct networks contains instability of abrupt collapse related to the global rule of activation. As a remedy of the collapse instability, here we investigate a model of correlated NoN. We find that the collapse instability can be removed when hubs provide the majority of interconnections and interconnections are convergent between hubs. Thus, our study identifies a stable structure of correlated NoN against catastrophic failures. Our result further suggests a plausible way to enhance network robustness by manipulating connection patterns, along with other methods such as controlling the state of node based on a local rule.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccae:34f43e70</id><title>Correlated network of networks enhances robustness against catastrophic failures</title><fingerprint>abd3e7f7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byungjoon Min, Muhua Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Inertial sensors offer the potential for integration into wireless virtual reality systems that allow the users to walk freely through virtual environments. However, owing to drift errors, inertial sensors cannot accurately estimate head and body orientations in the long run, and when walking indoors, this error cannot be corrected by magnetometers, due to the magnetic field distortion created by ferromagnetic materials present in buildings. This paper proposes a technique, called EHBD (Equalization of Head and Body Directions), to address this problem using two head- and shoulder-located magnetometers. Due to their proximity, their distortions are assumed to be similar and the magnetometer measurements are used to detect when the user is looking straight forward. Then, the system corrects the discrepancies between the estimated directions of the head and the shoulder, which are provided by gyroscopes and consequently are affected by drift errors. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of this technique in two tasks (navigation and navigation plus exploration) and using two different locomotion techniques: (1) gaze-directed mode (GD) in which the walking direction is forced to be the same as the head direction, and (2) decoupled direction mode (DD) in which the walking direction can be different from the viewing direction. The obtained results show that both locomotion modes show similar matching of the target path during the navigation task, while DD’s path matches the target path more closely than GD in the navigation plus exploration task. These results validate the EHBD technique especially when allowing different walking and viewing directions in the navigation plus exploration tasks, as expected. While the proposed method does not reach the accuracy of optical tracking (ideal case), it is an acceptable and satisfactory solution for users and is much more compact, portable and economical.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4601:34f43e70</id><title>Natural locomotion based on a reduced set of inertial sensors: Decoupling body and head directions indoors</title><fingerprint>5fed306f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto de la Rubia, Antonio Diaz-Estrella, Arcadio Reyes-Lecuona, Alyson Langley, Michael Brown, Sarah Sharples&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts. Surprisingly, our data show that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells are significantly enhanced in the genital tract TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice during mid-stage &lt;i&gt;Chlamydial&lt;/i&gt; infection. In late-stage infections, both mouse strains developed hydrosalpinx; however, the extent of hydrosalpinx was more severe in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Together, these data suggest that TLR3 promotes the clearance of &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; during early and mid-stages of genital tract infection, and that loss of TLR3 is detrimental in the development hydrosalpinx.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd06d:7c9981b6</id><title>Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) promotes the resolution of &amp;lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&amp;lt;/i&gt; genital tract infection in congenic C57BL/6N mice</title><fingerprint>a75a15bf</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sebastian E.

&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; is a protozoon parasite that causes congenital toxoplasmosis, as well as other serious clinical presentations, in immune compromised humans. Analyses of the prevalence and genotyping of strains from the definitive host and intermediate hosts will help to understanding the circulation of the different strains and elucidating the role of the genotype(s) in human toxoplasmosis. Turkey has a specific geographic location bridging Africa, Europe, and Asia. We hypothesized that &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains may have been transferred to Turkey from these continents via migratory birds or vice versa. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in wild birds of prey of İzmir and Manisa provinces as well as genetically characterize &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains from these wild birds to show the relation between bird strains and neighboring stray cats as well as human strains previously isolated in Turkey. Tissues obtained from 48 wild birds were investigated for the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA and then bioassayed in mouse. Isolated strains were genotyped using 15 microsatellite markers. The prevalence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA was found to be 89.6% (n: 43/48) in wild birds. Out of 43 positive samples, a total of 14 strains were genotyped by 15 microsatellite markers. Among them, eight were type II, three were type III and three were mixture of genotypes (two type II/II and one was II/III). These are the first data that showed the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; and types II and III genotypes in wild birds of Turkey. Moreover, Africa 1 was not detected. In addition, cluster analysis showed that &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains within type II and III lineage have close relation with strains previously isolated from stray cats in İzmir.

Sensing the environmental signals, the canonical Gα-cAMP/PKA pathway modulates mycelial growth and development, and negatively regulates some secondary metabolism in filamentous fungi, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. aflatoxin in &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus nidulans&lt;/i&gt;. Here we report the characterization of this signaling pathway in &lt;i&gt;Chaetomium globosum&lt;/i&gt;, a widely spread fungus known for synthesizing abundant secondary metabolites, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. chaetoglobosin A (ChA). RNAi-mediated knockdown of a putative Gα-encoding gene &lt;i&gt;gna-1&lt;/i&gt;, led to plural changes in phenotype, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. albino mycelium, significant restriction on perithecium development and decreased production of ChA. RNA-seq profiling and qRT-PCR verified significantly fall in expression of corresponding genes, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pks-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CgcheA&lt;/i&gt;. These defects could be restored by simultaneous knock-down of the &lt;i&gt;pkaR&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding a regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), suggesting that &lt;i&gt;pkaR&lt;/i&gt; had a negative effect on the above mentioned traits. Confirmatively, the intracellular level of cAMP in wild-type strain was about 3.4-fold to that in &lt;i&gt;gna-1&lt;/i&gt; silenced mutant pG14, and addition of a cAMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP, restored the same defects, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., the expression of &lt;i&gt;CgcheA&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the intracellular cAMP in &lt;i&gt;gna-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pkaR&lt;/i&gt; double silenced mutant was approaching the normal level. The following activity inhibition experiment proved that the expression of &lt;i&gt;CgcheA&lt;/i&gt; was indeed regulated by PKA.

Taken together, this study proposes that the heterotrimeric Gα protein-cAMP/PKA signaling pathway positively mediates the sexual development, melanin biosynthesis, and secondary metabolism in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;globosum&lt;/i&gt;.</description></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/270?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/270?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/270?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/270.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Schwartz, M.

Alveolar epithelial cells are critical to the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which are associated with overexpression of type 2 cytokine IL-13. IL-13 is known to induce the production of profibrotic (e.g., periostin) and pro-inflammatory (e.g., eotaxin-3) mediators in human airway epithelial cells, but it remains unclear if human primary alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression following IL-13 stimulation. The goals of this study are to determine if alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression upon IL-13 stimulation, and if alveolar and airway epithelial cells from the same subjects have similar responses to IL-13. Paired alveolar and airway epithelial cells were isolated from donors without any lung disease, and cultured under submerged or air-liquid interface conditions with or without IL-13. Up-regulation of periostin protein and mRNA was observed in IL-13-stimulated alveolar epithelial cells, which was comparable to that in IL-13-stimulated paired airway epithelial cells. IL-13 also increased eotaxin-3 expression in alveolar epithelial cells, but the level of eotaxin mRNA was lower in alveolar epithelial cells than in airway epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that human alveolar epithelial cells are able to produce periostin and eotaxin in responses to IL-13 stimulation. This study suggests the need to further determine the contribution of alveolar epithelial cell-derived mediators to pulmonary fibrosis.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df0db9fe:45935cf:9f3b30f2</id><title>IL-13 induces periostin and eotaxin expression in human primary alveolar epithelial cells: Comparison with paired airway epithelial cells</title><fingerprint>3c6ce039</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoko Ito, Reem Al Mubarak, Nicole Roberts, Kelly Correll, William Janssen, James Finigan, Rangnath Mishra, Hong Wei Chu&lt;/p&gt;

Protein trafficking within cilia is mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery composed of large protein complexes. The BBSome consists of eight BBS proteins encoded by causative genes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and has been implicated in the trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), by connecting the IFT machinery to cargo GPCRs. Membrane recruitment of the BBSome to promote cargo trafficking has been proposed to be regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase ARL6/BBS3, through its interaction with the BBS1 subunit of the BBSome. We here investigated how the BBSome core subcomplex composed of BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 assembles and interacts with ARL6, and found that the ARL6–BBS1 interaction is reinforced by BBS9. &lt;i&gt;BBS1&lt;/i&gt;-knockout (KO) cells showed defects in the ciliary entry of other BBSome subunits and ARL6, and in ciliary retrograde trafficking and the export of the GPCRs, Smoothened and GPR161. The trafficking defect of these GPCRs was rescued by the exogenous expression of wild-type BBS1, but not by its mutant lacking BBS9-binding ability. Our data thus indicate that the intact BBSome is required for retrograde trafficking of GPCRs out of cilia.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4252:9f3b30f2</id><title>BBS1 is involved in retrograde trafficking of ciliary GPCRs in the context of the BBSome complex</title><fingerprint>761ea815</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shohei Nozaki, Yohei Katoh, Takuya Kobayashi, Kazuhisa Nakayama&lt;/p&gt;

Autophagy plays a crucial role in health and disease, regulating central cellular processes such as adaptive stress responses, differentiation, tissue development, and homeostasis. However, the role of autophagy in human physiology is poorly understood, highlighting a need for a model human organ system to assess the efficacy and safety of strategies to therapeutically modulate autophagy. As a complete, cyclically remodelled (mini-)organ, the organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs), which, after massive growth (anagen), spontaneously enter into an apoptosis-driven organ involution (catagen) process, may provide such a model. Here, we reveal that in anagen, hair matrix keratinocytes (MKs) of organ-cultured HFs exhibit an active autophagic flux, as documented by evaluation of endogenous lipidated Light Chain 3B (LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) proteins and the ultrastructural visualization of autophagosomes at all stages of the autophagy process. This autophagic flux is altered during catagen, and genetic inhibition of autophagy promotes catagen development. Conversely, an anti–hair loss product markedly enhances intrafollicular autophagy, leading to anagen prolongation. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role of autophagy in human hair growth. Moreover, we show that organ-cultured scalp HFs are an excellent preclinical research model for exploring the role of autophagy in human tissue physiology and for evaluating the efficacy and tissue toxicity of candidate autophagy-modulatory agents in a living human (mini-)organ.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VVncDRle7Ww&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1626db778eb:4248d4:bdf8aaf1</id><title>Autophagy is essential for maintaining the growth of a human (mini-)organ: Evidence from scalp hair follicle organ culture</title><fingerprint>e04b4211</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chiara Parodi, Jonathan A.

In summary, tICA is a powerful novel algorithm for decomposing multi-omic data, which will be of great value to the research community.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195374</link><updated>1523480400000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195374</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Karine Le Blay</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195374</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195374</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1523480400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Karine Le Blay, Laëtitia Préau, Ghislaine Morvan-Dubois, Barbara Demeneix&lt;/p&gt;
Thyroid hormone (TH) orchestrates amphibian metamorphosis. Thus, this developmental phase is often used to study TH-dependent responses in specific tissues. However, TH signaling appears early in development raising the question of the control of TH availability in specific cell types prior to metamorphosis. TH availability is under strict temporal and tissue-specific control by deiodinases. We examined the expression of the TH-inactivating enzyme, deiodinase type 3 (D3), during early retinal development. To this end we created a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; transgenic line expressing GFP from the Xenopus &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter region (p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;) and followed p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;–GFP expression in pre-metamorphic tadpoles. To validate retinal GFP expression in the transgenic line as a function of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter activity, we used &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to compare endogenous &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression to reporter-driven GFP activity. Retinal expression of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; increased during pre-metamorphosis through stages NF41, 45 and 48. Both sets of results show &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; to have cell-specific, dynamic expression in the pre-metamorphic retina. At stage NF48, &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression co-localised with markers for photoreceptors, rods, Opsin-S cones and bipolar neurons. In contrast, in post-metamorphic juveniles &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression was reduced and spatially confined to certain photoreceptors and amacrine cells. We compared &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression at stages NF41 and NF48 with TH-dependent transcriptional responses using another transgenic reporter line: &lt;i&gt;THbZIP&lt;/i&gt;-GFP and by analyzing the expression of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-regulated genes in distinct TH availability contexts. At stage NF48, the majority of retinal cells expressing &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; were negative for T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signaling. Notably, most ganglion cells were virtually both &lt;i&gt;dio3-&lt;/i&gt;free and T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-responsive. The results show that &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; can reduce TH availability at the cellular scale. Further, a reduction in &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression can trigger fine-tuned T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; action in cell-type specific maturation at the right time, as exemplified here in photoreceptor survival in the pre-metamorphic retina.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd8a:9f3b30f2</id><title>Expression of the inactivating deiodinase, Deiodinase 3, in the pre-metamorphic tadpole retina</title><fingerprint>dff9ba9d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karine Le Blay, Laëtitia Préau, Ghislaine Morvan-Dubois, Barbara Demeneix&lt;/p&gt;

These results have implications for pituitary development, plasticity and regeneration.</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3380.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3380.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3380.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3380</canonicalUrl><author><name>Bastian Vogeli, Sylvain Engilberge, Eric Girard, Francois Riobe, Olivier Maury, Tobias J.

Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bézier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wFWSqfInABw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d5:bdf8aaf1</id><title>A modelling approach for exploring muscle dynamics during cyclic contractions</title><fingerprint>19a254ec</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephanie A.

The necrophilous insect fauna on carcasses varies seasonally and geographically. The ecological succession of insects arriving to decaying neonate pig carcasses in central North Carolina during late summer was sampled using a novel vented-chamber collection method. We collected six blow fly species, flesh flies, house flies and 10 beetle taxa, including four species of scarab beetles. Necrophilous fly activity dominated the early decomposition stages, whereas beetle numbers remained low until day 4. By day 7, more than 50% of the pig carcasses were skeletonized and they attracted few insects. Differences in the taxa and successional patterns documented in this experiment and a previous study in the same location highlight the ecological variation in such investigations, and underscore the need for standardization, as well as for ecological succession studies on finer geographic scales.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66c9:9f3b30f2</id><title>Ecological succession of adult necrophilous insects on neonate &amp;lt;i&gt;Sus scrofa domesticus&amp;lt;/i&gt; in central North Carolina</title><fingerprint>a27e7783</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Angela Cruise, David W.

Cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet), an oral calcimimetic agent has been widely used for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In sharp contrast to vitamin D receptor activators, cinacalcet suppresses SHPT without inducing hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia. Nevertheless, some patients remain refractory to SHPT with this agent, as the dose cannot be sufficiently increased due to gastrointestinal symptoms. In order to resolve this issue, we have developed a newly synthesized calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580). In a rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy, oral administration of evocalcet efficiently suppressed the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). With regard to the gastro-intestinal effects, cinacalcet induced a significant delay in gastric emptying in rats, while evocalcet did no marked effects on it. Evocalcet also demonstrated the less induction of emesis compared to cinacalcet in common marmosets. The pharmacological effects of evocalcet were observed at lower doses because of its higher bioavailability than cinacalcet, which may have contributed to the reduced GI tract symptoms. In addition, evocalcet showed no substantial direct inhibition of any CYP isozymes in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; liver microsome assay, suggesting a better profile in drug interactions than cinacalcet that inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. These findings suggest that evocalcet can be a better alternative to cinacalcet, an oral calcimimetic agent, with a wider safety margin.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f63:34f43e70</id><title>A novel calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580), suppresses the parathyroid cell function with little effect on the gastrointestinal tract or CYP isozymes &amp;lt;i&gt;in vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>6e5b4f3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takehisa Kawata, Shin Tokunaga, Miki Murai, Nami Masuda, Waka Haruyama, Youji Shoukei, Yutaka Hisada, Tetsuya Yanagida, Hiroshi Miyazaki, Michihito Wada, Tadao Akizawa, Masafumi Fukagawa&lt;/p&gt;

Recent data suggest the existence of a complement alternative pathway activation in the pathogenesis of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a condition that remains poorly understood. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients with regard to their plasma complement levels at diagnosis. A retrospective monocentric study carried out at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of proteinase-3- or myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA and MPA patients from January 2000 to June 2016 and from September 2011 to June 2016, respectively. All patients with available C3 and C4 levels at diagnosis were included. Patients were categorized in the hypocomplementemia group if their C3 and/or C4 levels at diagnosis were below the lower limit of the normal range. Among the 76 AAV patients (43 GPA, 33 MPA), 4 (5%) had hypocomplementemia, and the 72 remaining patients exhibited normal plasma complement levels. All 4 hypocomplementemia patients had renal involvement. Hypocomplementemia was followed in 1 patient whose post-treatment complement level normalized within 1 month. Among all clinical and ANCA specificity, including relapse-free survival (p = 0.093), only overall and renal survival rates were significantly lower in the hypocomplementemia group (p = 0.0011 and p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). Hypocomplementemia with low C3 and/or C4 levels at GPA or MPA diagnosis may be responsible for worse survival and renal prognosis. These results argue for larger and prospective studies to better determine the epidemiology of the disease and to assess complement-targeting therapy in these patients.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d74c:9f3b30f2</id><title>Hypocomplementemia is associated with worse renal survival in ANCA-positive granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis</title><fingerprint>f834d69c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Deshayes, Achille Aouba, Kathy Khoy, Delphine Mariotte, Thierry Lobbedez, Nicolas Martin Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Broad scale population estimates of declining species are desired for conservation efforts. However, for many secretive species including large carnivores, such estimates are often difficult. Based on published density estimates obtained through camera trapping, presence/absence data, and globally available predictive variables derived from satellite imagery, we modelled density and occurrence of a large carnivore, the jaguar, across the species’ entire range. We then combined these models in a hierarchical framework to estimate the total population. Our models indicate that potential jaguar density is best predicted by measures of primary productivity, with the highest densities in the most productive tropical habitats and a clear declining gradient with distance from the equator. Jaguar distribution, in contrast, is determined by the combined effects of human impacts and environmental factors: probability of jaguar occurrence increased with forest cover, mean temperature, and annual precipitation and declined with increases in human foot print index and human density. Probability of occurrence was also significantly higher for protected areas than outside of them. We estimated the world’s jaguar population at 173,000 (95% CI: 138,000–208,000) individuals, mostly concentrated in the Amazon Basin; elsewhere, populations tend to be small and fragmented.

Broad scale population estimates of declining species are desired for conservation efforts. However, for many secretive species including large carnivores, such estimates are often difficult. Based on published density estimates obtained through camera trapping, presence/absence data, and globally available predictive variables derived from satellite imagery, we modelled density and occurrence of a large carnivore, the jaguar, across the species’ entire range. We then combined these models in a hierarchical framework to estimate the total population. Our models indicate that potential jaguar density is best predicted by measures of primary productivity, with the highest densities in the most productive tropical habitats and a clear declining gradient with distance from the equator. Jaguar distribution, in contrast, is determined by the combined effects of human impacts and environmental factors: probability of jaguar occurrence increased with forest cover, mean temperature, and annual precipitation and declined with increases in human foot print index and human density. Probability of occurrence was also significantly higher for protected areas than outside of them. We estimated the world’s jaguar population at 173,000 (95% CI: 138,000–208,000) individuals, mostly concentrated in the Amazon Basin; elsewhere, populations tend to be small and fragmented. The high number of jaguars results from the large total area still occupied (almost 9 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low human densities (&amp;lt; 1 person/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coinciding with high primary productivity in the core area of jaguar range. Our results show the importance of protected areas for jaguar persistence. We conclude that combining modelling of density and distribution can reveal ecological patterns and processes at global scales, can provide robust estimates for use in species assessments, and can guide broad-scale conservation actions.</description></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011056?af=R</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011056?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011056?af=R</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Ngo Minh Toan</name></author><published>1520387556000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88de:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Forced-rupture of cell-adhesion complexes reveals abrupt switch between two brittle states</title><fingerprint>d549783b</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3716.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3716.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3716.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/14/3716/F1.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>406</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3716</canonicalUrl><author><name>Yuliya Salanenka, Inge Verstraeten, Christian Lofke, Kaori Tabata, Satoshi Naramoto, Matouš Glanc, Jiři Friml</name></author><published>1522774666000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522778515834</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) is a crucial regulator of growth and development.

Background &lt;p&gt;The ageing population and the expected increase in the number of elderly patients make an evidence-based assessment of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in old patients progressively more important. Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO results for patient aged &amp;lt;65 years is well known. However, the risk profile and in-hospital prognosis of advanced age patients with ECMO still need more investigation. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predicted the outcomes for elderly patients who received VA-ECMO.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this retrospective study, medical records for patients with ECMO aged 65 years and over were collected between 2009 and 2012 at a tertiary hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 99 patients (mean age: 76.4±6.4 years) were included. The most common condition requiring VA-ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. Among survivors on VA-ECMO, 28 (28.3%) patients were successfully weaned from support. Thirteen (13.1%) patients were successfully discharged. We found that cardiogenic shock (OR = 3.158, P = 0.013), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR = 1.147, P&amp;lt;0.001), and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) score (OR = 1.054, P = 0.001) were risk factors associated with survival on VA-ECMO. By using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, the APACHE II score and SAPS II score displayed acceptable discriminative power (AUC 0.722; 0.715, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the risk of mortality increases with cardiogenic shock, higher APACHE II score, and higher SAPS II score. These risk factors can be utilized as potential predictors to identify the potential candidates for ECMO support.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd07a:7c9981b6</id><title>Clinical risk factors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in older adults</title><fingerprint>16e368fe</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Te-Chun Yeh, Hsiao-Huang Chang, Luo-Ping Ger, Ju-O Wang, Senyeong Kao, Shung-Tai Ho&lt;/p&gt;

The spatial distribution of nine Northwest Atlantic groundfish stocks was documented using spatial indicators based on Northeast Fisheries Science Center spring and fall bottom trawl survey data, 1963–2016. We then evaluated the relative importance of population size, fishing pressure and bottom temperature on spatial distribution with an information theoretic approach. Northward movement in the spring was generally consistent with prior analyses, whereas changes in depth distribution and area occupancy were not. Only two stocks exhibited the same changes in spatiotemporal distribution in the fall as compared with the spring. Fishing pressure was the most important predictor of the center of gravity (i.e., bivariate mean location of the population) for the majority of stocks in the spring, whereas in the fall this was restricted to the east-west component. Fishing pressure was also the most important predictor of the dispersion around the center of gravity in both spring and fall. In contrast, biomass was the most important predictor of area occupancy for the majority of stocks in both seasons. The relative importance of bottom temperature was ranked highest in the fewest number of cases. This study shows that fishing pressure, in addition to the previously established role of climate, influences the spatial distribution of groundfish in the Northwest Atlantic. More broadly, this study is one of a small but growing body of literature to demonstrate that fishing pressure has an effect on the spatial distribution of marine resources. Future work must consider both fishing pressure and climate when examining mechanisms underlying fish distribution shifts.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7f:fc1f8953</id><title>Relative importance of population size, fishing pressure and temperature on the spatial distribution of nine Northwest Atlantic groundfish stocks</title><fingerprint>4e12e01d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charles F.

Along with the rapid development of Intelligent Transportation Systems, traffic data collection technologies have progressed fast. The emergence of innovative data collection technologies such as remote traffic microwave sensor, Bluetooth sensor, GPS-based floating car method, and automated license plate recognition, has significantly increased the variety and volume of traffic data. Despite the development of these technologies, the missing data issue is still a problem that poses great challenge for data based applications such as traffic forecasting, real-time incident detection, dynamic route guidance, and massive evacuation optimization. A thorough literature review suggests most current imputation models either focus on the temporal nature of the traffic data and fail to consider the spatial information of neighboring locations or assume the data follow a certain distribution. These two issues reduce the imputation accuracy and limit the use of the corresponding imputation methods respectively. As a result, this paper presents a Kriging based data imputation approach that is able to fully utilize the spatiotemporal correlation in the traffic data and that does not assume the data follow any distribution. A set of scenarios with different missing rates are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of two other widely used methods, historical average and K-nearest neighborhood. Comparison results indicate that the proposed method has the highest imputation accuracy and is more flexible compared to other methods.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:334415c:7d6c1c1c</id><title>A Kriging based spatiotemporal approach for traffic volume data imputation</title><fingerprint>1f5c87d9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongtai Yang, Jianjiang Yang, Lee D.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine the factors associated with gait parameters in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The gait analysis was performed in a large cohort of RA patients, and three basic gait parameters (step length, cadence and gait speed) were calculated. Clinical and laboratory data were also collected. Factors associated with gait parameters were analyzed using multivariable linear regression in the three models with forced entry. Then, we divided those patients with Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ) scores ≤ 0.5 into two groups according to their gait speed that were compared to identify the characteristics of patients with a good HAQ score but poor walking ability.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 318 female patients were analyzed. Knee extension strength had the strongest positive association with all three gait parameters (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), while methotrexate use was also positively associated with all three gait parameters (step length: P &amp;lt; 0.05, cadence: P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 3, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01). The disease activity score was negatively associated with step length and gait speed (step length, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 3). 26% of patients with good HAQ scores showed slow gait speed. Patients with good HAQ scores and slow gait speed had higher disease activity scores (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and lower knee extension strength (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) than those with good HAQ scores and normal gait speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;High knee extension strength, low disease activity and administration of methotrexate were strongly associated with good walking ability in female patients with RA.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine the factors associated with gait parameters in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The gait analysis was performed in a large cohort of RA patients, and three basic gait parameters (step length, cadence and gait speed) were calculated. Clinical and laboratory data were also collected. Factors associated with gait parameters were analyzed using multivariable linear regression in the three models with forced entry. Then, we divided those patients with Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ) scores ≤ 0.5 into two groups according to their gait speed that were compared to identify the characteristics of patients with a good HAQ score but poor walking ability.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 318 female patients were analyzed.

Neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are apicobasally elongated and densely packed in the developing brain, systematically move their nuclei/somata in a cell cycle–dependent manner, called interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM): apical during G2 and basal during G1. Although intracellular molecular mechanisms of individual IKNM have been explored, how heterogeneous IKNMs are collectively coordinated is unknown. Our quantitative cell-biological and in silico analyses revealed that tissue elasticity mechanically assists an initial step of basalward IKNM. When the soma of an M-phase progenitor cell rounds up using actomyosin within the subapical space, a microzone within 10 μm from the surface, which is compressed and elastic because of the apical surface’s contractility, laterally pushes the densely neighboring processes of non–M-phase cells. The pressed processes then recoil centripetally and basally to propel the nuclei/somata of the progenitor’s daughter cells. Thus, indirect neighbor-assisted transfer of mechanical energy from mother to daughter helps efficient brain development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QIHSf4hXHfg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162e4278028:4dbf10:76251cdd</id><title>Elasticity-based boosting of neuroepithelial nucleokinesis via indirect energy transfer from mother to daughter</title><fingerprint>d57d8d02</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoyasu Shinoda, Arata Nagasaka, Yasuhiro Inoue, Ryo Higuchi, Yoshiaki Minami, Kagayaki Kato, Makoto Suzuki, Takefumi Kondo, Takumi Kawaue, Kanako Saito, Naoto Ueno, Yugo Fukazawa, Masaharu Nagayama, Takashi Miura, Taiji Adachi, Takaki Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

Natural reservoirs of &lt;i&gt;Yersinia (Y&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; comprise different animal species, but little is known about the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of yersiniosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; among game animals in Poland. The bio-serotypes and the pathogenicity markers of the analyzed isolates were determined. The experimental material comprised rectal swabs from 857 free-living animals hunter-harvested over a period of 2 years (2013–2014) in hunting districts across Poland. The isolates from bacteriological studies were confirmed by PCR and bio-serotyped based on the results of biochemical and agglutination tests. In the group of the 218 analyzed isolates of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, 133 were derived from wild boars, 70 from red deer, 11 from roe deer and 4 from fallow deer, and they accounted for 61.0%, 32.1%, 5.1% and 1.8% of all isolates, respectively. Bio-serotyping assays revealed that 91.7% of the examined isolates belonged to biotype 1A (200/218). The remaining 18 isolates belonged to bio-serotypes 1B/NI (3/218, 1.4%), 1B/O:8 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/NI (6/218, 2.8%), 2/O:27 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:9 (2/218, 0.9%), 3/NI (2/218, 0.9%), 4/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%) and 4/O:9 (1/218, 0.5%). The &lt;i&gt;ail&lt;/i&gt; gene, a suggestive virulence gene for &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, has been found in 30 isolates from 20 wild boars, in 6 isolates from red deer, and in 1 isolate from roe deer. Our study demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; is frequently isolated from game animals in Poland, which poses a risk of spreading these infectious agents to other animal species and humans.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde20:9f3b30f2</id><title>The prevalence of &amp;lt;i&gt;Yersinia enterocolitica&amp;lt;/i&gt; in game animals in Poland</title><fingerprint>e66ae121</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kinga Syczyło, Aleksandra Platt-Samoraj, Agata Bancerz-Kisiel, Anna Szczerba-Turek, Joanna Pajdak-Czaus, Sebastian Łabuć, Zbigniew Procajło, Piotr Socha, Gulzhan Chuzhebayeva, Wojciech Szweda&lt;/p&gt;

Cadmium exposure can cause renal tubular dysfunction. Recent studies show that vitamin D can play multiple roles in the body. However, the association between serum vitamin D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a general population exposed to cadmium has not been clarified. We performed study to assess the effects of cadmium on serum 25(OH) D levels and the association between serum 25(OH) D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a population environmentally exposed to cadmium. A total of 133 subjects living in control area and two cadmium polluted areas were included in the present study. Cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd), urinary β2Microglobulin (UBMG), urinary retinol binding protein (URBP) and serum 25 (OH) D were determined. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between 25 (OH) D and prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction. No significant differences were observed in serum 25(OH) D levels among the four quartile of UCd and BCd after adjusting with cofounders. After adjusted with the confounders, the odds ratio (OR) of subjects with 25(OH) D ≥ 40 ng/ml were 0.20 (95%CI: 0.1–0.8) if UBMG was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.1–1.1) if URBP was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction, compared with those with 25(OH) D &amp;lt; 30 ng/ml, respectively. Similar results were observed in those subjects living in cadmium polluted areas or with high level of UCd or BCd. Our data indicated that cadmium exposure did not affect serum 25(OH) D level and high 25 (OH) D levels were associated with a decreased risk of renal tubular dysfunction induced by cadmium.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9be:9aea0a7d</id><title>The association between serum vitamin D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a general population exposed to cadmium in China</title><fingerprint>2c4ab63a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiao Chen, Yan Dai, Zhongqiu Wang, Guoying Zhu, Xiaoqiang Ding, Taiyi Jin&lt;/p&gt;
Cadmium exposure can cause renal tubular dysfunction. Recent studies show that vitamin D can play multiple roles in the body. However, the association between serum vitamin D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a general population exposed to cadmium has not been clarified. We performed study to assess the effects of cadmium on serum 25(OH) D levels and the association between serum 25(OH) D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a population environmentally exposed to cadmium.

Cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd), urinary β2Microglobulin (UBMG), urinary retinol binding protein (URBP) and serum 25 (OH) D were determined.

Drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA) to prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are potent anti-inflammatory agents used widely in the treatment of joint and muscle pain. Despite their benefits, daily use of these drugs has been associated with hypertension, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities. It is now recognized that ARA is metabolized to a number of bioactive oxygenated lipids (oxylipins) by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Currently, the contribution of individual variability in ARA metabolism in response to the COX-2 inhibitors and potential adverse effects remains poorly understood. Using patient samples from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III selenium/celecoxib (Sel/Cel) trial for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we analyzed plasma concentrations of 74 oxylipins in a subset of participants who received celecoxib (n = 90) or placebo (n = 95). We assessed the effect of celecoxib (with and without low dose aspirin) on circulating oxylipins and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Individual CYP450- and LOX- but not COX-derived metabolites were higher with celecoxib than placebo (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) and differences were greater among non-aspirin users. LOX derived 5- and 8-HETE were elevated with celecoxib and positively associated with systolic blood pressure (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011 and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019 respectively). 20-HETE, a prohypertensive androgen-sensitive CYP450 metabolite was higher with celecoxib absent aspirin and was positively associated with SBP in men (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.040) but not women. Independent of celecoxib or aspirin, LOX derived metabolites from ARA were strongly associated with SBP including 5- and 8-HETE. These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae6d:fc1f8953</id><title>Celecoxib use and circulating oxylipins in a colon polyp prevention trial</title><fingerprint>21014197</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica A.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by alveolar epithelial damage, patchy interstitial fibrosis and diffuse microvascular abnormalities. In IPF, alveolar clustering of iron-laden alveolar macrophages—a common sign of microhemorrhage, has been associated with vascular abnormalities and worsening of pulmonary hypertension. As iron-dependent ROS generation has been shown to induce unrestrained macrophage activation in disease models of vascular damage, we explored alveolar macrophage activation phenotype in IPF patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (CTR, n = 7) by RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. The frequencies of macrophages in BAL cells were 86+4% and 83.4+8% in IPF and CTR groups, respectively (p-value = 0.41). In IPF patients, BAL cells showed increased iron-dependent ROS generation (p-value&amp;lt;0.05 vs CTR). Gene expression analysis showed overrepresentation of Gene Ontology processes/functions and KEGG pathways enriched in upregulated M1-type inflammatory (p-value&amp;lt;0.01), M2-type anti-inflammatory/tissue remodeling (p-value&amp;lt;0.0001), and MTPP-type chronic inflammatory/angiogenic (p-value&amp;lt;0.0001) chemokine and cytokine genes. The &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; finding was confirmed by the induction of iron-dependent ROS generation and chemokine/cytokine overexpression of Ccl4, Cxcl10 (M1), Il1rn (M2), Cxcl2, and Cxcl7 (MTPP) in MH-S murine immortalized alveolar macrophages exposed to ferric ammonium citrate in culture (p-value&amp;lt;0.05 vs CTR). The data show alveolar macrophage expression of a pro-inflammatory, tissue remodeling and angiogenic complex activation pattern, suggesting that iron accumulation may play a role in macrophage activation.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc712d:34f43e70</id><title>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis express a complex pro-inflammatory, pro-repair, angiogenic activation pattern, likely associated with macrophage iron accumulation</title><fingerprint>b4eabd67</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jungnam Lee, Ivan Arisi, Ermanno Puxeddu, Lazarus K.

The innate immune system is paramount in the response to and clearance of influenza A virus (IAV) infection in non-immune individuals. Known factors include type I and III interferons and antiviral pathogen recognition receptors, and the cascades of antiviral and pro- and anti-inflammatory gene expression they induce. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly recognized to participate in post-transcriptional modulation of these responses, but the temporal dynamics of how these players of the antiviral innate immune response collaborate to combat infection remain poorly characterized. We quantified the expression of miRNAs and protein coding genes in the lungs of pigs 1, 3, and 14 days after challenge with swine IAV (H1N2). Through RT-qPCR we observed a 400-fold relative increase in IFN-λ3 gene expression on day 1 after challenge, and a strong interferon-mediated antiviral response was observed on days 1 and 3 accompanied by up-regulation of genes related to the pro-inflammatory response and apoptosis. Using small RNA sequencing and qPCR validation we found 27 miRNAs that were differentially expressed after challenge, with the highest number of regulated miRNAs observed on day 3. In contrast, the number of protein coding genes found to be regulated due to IAV infection peaked on day 1. Pulmonary miRNAs may thus be aimed at fine-tuning the initial rapid inflammatory response after IAV infection. Specifically, we found five miRNAs (ssc-miR-15a, ssc-miR-18a, ssc-miR-21, ssc-miR-29b, and hsa-miR-590-3p)–four known porcine miRNAs and one novel porcine miRNA candidate–to be potential modulators of viral pathogen recognition and apoptosis. A total of 11 miRNAs remained differentially expressed 14 days after challenge, at which point the infection had cleared. In conclusion, the results suggested a role for miRNAs both during acute infection as well as later, with the potential to influence lung homeostasis and susceptibility to secondary infections in the lungs of pigs after IAV infection.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7ef:7d6c1c1c</id><title>IFN-λ and microRNAs are important modulators of the pulmonary innate immune response against influenza A (H1N2) infection in pigs</title><fingerprint>f37e882a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Louise Brogaard, Lars E.

Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis is maintained through Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels such as MgtE, a prokaryotic Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel whose gating is regulated by intracellular Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. Our previous crystal structure of MgtE in the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound, closed state revealed the existence of seven crystallographically-independent Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding sites, Mg1–Mg7. The role of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding to each site in channel closure remains unknown.

To grow straight and upright, plants need to regulate actively their posture. Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation (tilting) experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observations of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. The relationship between those oscillations and the postural control of the organ remains unclear, but indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef06:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Coupled ultradian growth and curvature oscillations during gravitropic movement in disturbed wheat coleoptiles</title><fingerprint>7ec64172</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Renaud Bastien, Olivia Guayasamin, Stéphane Douady, Bruno Moulia&lt;/p&gt;

While previous approaches aim to capture all localization changes for a single screen as accurately as possible, our work aims to integrate large amounts of imaging data to find unexpected new cell biology.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</link><updated>1524517200000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Tien-Kieu Nguyen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1524517200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tien-Kieu Nguyen, Moon-Gi Hong, Pahn-Shick Chang, Byung-Hoo Lee, Sang-Ho Yoo&lt;/p&gt;
d-Tagatose has gained substantial interest due to its potential functionalities as a sucrose substitute. In this study, the gene &lt;i&gt;araA&lt;/i&gt;, encoding l-arabinose isomerase (l-AI) from &lt;i&gt;Clostridium hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; (DSM 15053), was cloned and expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; BL21 (DE3). This gene consists of 1,506 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 501 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 56,554 Da. Since l-AI was expressed as an intracellular inclusion body, this enzyme was solubilized with guanidine hydrochloride, refolded, and activated with a descending concentration gradient of urea. The purified enzyme exhibited the greatest activity at 50°C, pH 7–7.5, and required 1 mM of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a cofactor. Notably, the catalytic efficiency (3.69 mM&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) of l-AI from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; on galactose was significantly greater than that of other previously reported enzymes. The bioconversion yield of d-tagatose using the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; l-arabinose isomerase at 60°C reached approximately 46% from 10 mM of d-galactose after 2 h. From these results, it is suggested that the l-arabinose isomerase from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; could be utilized as a potential enzyme for d-tagatose production due to its high conversion yield at an industrially competitive temperature.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb95:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Biochemical properties of L-arabinose isomerase from &amp;lt;i&gt;Clostridium hylemonae&amp;lt;/i&gt; to produce D-tagatose as a functional sweetener</title><fingerprint>afe65d58</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tien-Kieu Nguyen, Moon-Gi Hong, Pahn-Shick Chang, Byung-Hoo Lee, Sang-Ho Yoo&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Following its publication in 2008, the Global Nutritional Index (GNI) which captures the triple burden of malnutrition, has been updated to assess the overall nutritional status and nutritional trends of countries, regions and the world, including both under-nutrition and over-nutrition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The GNI was modeled on the Human Development Index, using geometric means of three normalized indicators: protein-energy malnutrition (PEM, measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) from PEM), micronutrient deficiency (MID, measured by DALYs from MID), and penalizing obesity (percent female obesity). GNI (range 0–1) was calculated from 1990–2015 for 186 countries, in seven World Bank income and WHO region groupings.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;World GNI increased from 0.433 to 0.473 as decreased deficits overcompensated for the rise in obesity. GNI for African low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (median 0.301 to 0.392) and South-East Asian LMIC (0.456 to 0.564) improved significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), while for high-income countries (0.657 to 0.611) worsened significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). GNI for American LMIC (0.459 to 0.457), European LMIC (0.571 to 0.575), Eastern Mediterranean LMIC (0.484 to 0.483) and Western Pacific LMIC (0.433 to 0.494) were unchanged. The disaggregation of the GNI showed that in nearly all the seven country groups there was a significant decrease in both PEM and MID (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) (except in HIC where only PEM dropped), and a significant increase in obesity (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These trends are the result of the reciprocal changes between decreased under-nutrition and increased over-nutrition, which has become a major cause of malnutrition worldwide.

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls.

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls. Furthermore, higher proportions of viral sequences from northern pintails (&lt;i&gt;Anas acuta&lt;/i&gt;), emperor geese and glaucous-winged gulls were grouped in phylogenetic clades that included IAV sequences originating from wild birds sampled in Asia as compared to non-pintail dabbling ducks, a difference that may be related to intercontinental migratory tendencies of host species. Our summary of research and surveillance efforts at Izembek NWR will assist in future prioritization of which hosts to sample and swab types to collect in Alaska and elsewhere in order to maximize isolate recovery, subtype and sequence diversity for resultant viruses, and detection of evidence for intercontinental viral exchange.</description></item><item><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36992</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Women scientists across India are working together to build and advocate for family-friendly policies at their institutes.</content></summary><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36992</originId><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36992</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36992</canonicalUrl><author><name>bridgetmkuehn@gmail.com (Bridget M Kuehn)</name></author><published>1523232000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>56</engagement><crawled>1523275493089</crawled><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162aa4b6ee1:1529305:7c9981b6</id><title>Communities creating change</title><fingerprint>8a3a0f4b</fingerprint><description>Women scientists across India are working together to build and advocate for family-friendly policies at their institutes.</description></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00117</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00117/20180412/images/medium/jm-2018-00117q_0018.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00117&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

We investigate the influence of the visual appearance of a negotiator on persuasiveness within the context of negotiations. Psychological experiments were conducted to quantitatively analyze the relationship between visual appearance and the use of language. Male and female participants were shown three female and male photographs, respectively. They were asked to report how they felt about each photograph using a seven-point semantic differential (SD) scale for six affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness). Participants then answered how they felt about each negotiation scenario (they were presented with pictures and a situation combined with negotiation sentences) using a seven-point SD scale for seven affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, and degree of persuasion). Two experiments were conducted using different participant groups depending on the negotiation situations. Photographs with good or bad appearances were found to show high or low degrees of persuasion, respectively. A multiple regression equation was obtained, indicating the importance of the three language factors (euphemistic, honorific, and sympathy expressions) to impressions made during negotiation. The result shows that there are optimal negotiation sentences based on various negotiation factors, such as visual appearance and use of language. For example, persons with good appearance might worsen their impression during negotiations by using certain language, although their initial impression was positive, and persons with bad appearance could effectively improve their impressions in negotiations through their use of language, although the final impressions of their negotiation counterpart might still be more negative than those for persons with good appearance. In contrast, the impressions made by persons of normal appearance were not easily affected by their use of language. The results of the present study have significant implications for future studies of effective negotiation strategies considering visual appearance as well as gender.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d739:9f3b30f2</id><title>Optimal linguistic expression in negotiations depends on visual appearance</title><fingerprint>c300347c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maki Sakamoto, Jinhwan Kwon, Hikaru Tamada, Yumi Hirahara&lt;/p&gt;

Studies conducted during the past few years have confirmed active West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in Serbia. Based on these studies and the epidemiological situation, the Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection launched national WNV surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015. The programmes encompassed the territory of Serbia and were conducted by the veterinary service in collaboration with entomologists and ornithologists. The objective of the programmes was early detection of WNV and timely reporting to the public health service and local authorities to increase both clinical and mosquito control preparedness. The WNV surveillance programmes were based on direct and indirect surveillance of the presence of WNV by the serological testing of initially seronegative sentinel horses and chickens as well as through viral detection in pooled mosquito and wild bird samples. The most intense WNV circulation was observed in all seven districts of Vojvodina Province (northern Serbia) and Belgrade City, where most of the positive samples were detected among sentinel animals, mosquitoes and wild birds. The West Nile virus surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015 showed satisfactory results in their capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for humans and their sensitivity to early detect viral circulation at the enzootic level. Most of the human cases were preceded by the detection of WNV circulation as part of the surveillance programmes. According to the existing data, it can be reasonably assumed that WNV infection, now an endemic infection in Serbia, will continue to present a significant problem for the veterinary service and public health.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd079:7c9981b6</id><title>Methodology and results of integrated WNV surveillance programmes in Serbia</title><fingerprint>f4d07f1d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tamaš Petrović, Milanko Šekler, Dušan Petrić, Sava Lazić, Zoran Debeljak, Dejan Vidanović, Aleksandra Ignjatović Ćupina, Gospava Lazić, Diana Lupulović, Mišo Kolarević, Budimir Plavšić&lt;/p&gt;

According to the existing data, it can be reasonably assumed that WNV infection, now an endemic infection in Serbia, will continue to present a significant problem for the veterinary service and public health.</description></item><item><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.30187</link><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>A diverse array of species on the planet employ the Earth&apos;s magnetic field as a navigational aid.

Background &lt;p&gt;Measuring viral DNA methylation in human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women showed promise for accurate detection of high-grade cervical lesions and cancer.

Target CpGs were selected on the HPV L1 (two regions, L1 I and L1 II) and L2 genes.Study samples included DNA stored at Turin, Italy, purified by cervical cells collected in Standard Transport Medium or PreservCyt from women who participated in two studies (N = 126 and 140) nested within the regional organized screening programme.PCR consensus primers were designed by PyroMark Assay Design software to be suitable for amplification of many different oncogenic HPV types.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Generation of consensus primers was successful for L1 I and II regions, unsuccessful for L2 region, for which HPV type-specific primers remained necessary. The difference between replicated tests on the same sample was ≤4% in 88%, 77% and 91% of cases when targeting the L1 I, L1 II and L2 regions, respectively. The corresponding intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were 0.94, 0.87 and 0.97 respectively.

The processes regulating peripheral naive T-cell numbers and clonal diversity remain poorly understood. Conceptually, homeostatic mechanisms must fall into the broad categories of neutral (simple random birth–death models), competition (regulation of cell numbers through quorum-sensing, perhaps via limiting shared resources), adaptation (involving cell-intrinsic changes in homeostatic fitness, defined as net growth rate over time), or selection (involving the loss or outgrowth of cell populations deriving from intercellular variation in fitness). There may also be stably maintained heterogeneity within the naive T-cell pool. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we confront very general models of these processes with an array of experimental data, both new and published. While reduced competition for homeostatic stimuli may impact cell survival or proliferation in neonates or under moderate to severe lymphopenia, we show that the only mechanism capable of explaining multiple, independent experimental studies of naive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell homeostasis in mice from young adulthood into old age is one of adaptation, in which cells act independently and accrue a survival or proliferative advantage continuously with their post-thymic age. However, aged naive T cells may also be functionally impaired, and so the accumulation of older cells via ‘conditioning through experience’ may contribute to reduced immune responsiveness in the elderly.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_sQDfPObu6Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162b5d1647d:50b536:76251cdd</id><title>Age is not just a number: Naive T cells increase their ability to persist in the circulation over time</title><fingerprint>49ad6524</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sanket Rane, Thea Hogan, Benedict Seddon, Andrew J.

However, aged naive T cells may also be functionally impaired, and so the accumulation of older cells via ‘conditioning through experience’ may contribute to reduced immune responsiveness in the elderly.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_sQDfPObu6Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3512.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3512.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3512.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/14.cover-source.jpg?itok=_b41cKRw</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>480</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3512</canonicalUrl><author><name>Vincenzo Carnevale</name></author><published>1522774666000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522778515834</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Eukaryotic voltage gated sodium-selective channels (VGSCs) enable influx of Na+ into excitable cells in response to a change in the transmembrane potential.

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) that are symbiotically associated with &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria can kill target insects via direct infection and toxin action. There are limited reports identifying such organisms in the National Park of Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify EPNs and symbiotic bacteria from Nam Nao National Park, Phetchabun Province, Thailand and to evaluate the larvicidal activity of bacteria against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 12 EPN isolates belonging to &lt;i&gt;Steinernema&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heterorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; were obtained form 940 soil samples between February 2014 and July 2016. EPNs were molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;websteri&lt;/i&gt; (10 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates). Symbiotic bacteria were isolated from EPNs and molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (13 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (11 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonica&lt;/i&gt; (1 isolate). For the bioassay, bacterial suspensions were evaluated for toxicity against third to early fourth instar larvae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; spp. The larvae of both &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; species were orally susceptible to symbiotic bacteria. The highest larval mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; was 99% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (bNN112.3_TH) at 96 h, and the highest mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was 98% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (bNN121.4_TH) at 96 h. In contrast to the control groups (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and distilled water), the mortality rate of both mosquito larvae ranged between 0 and 7% at 72 h. Here, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand.

Skeletal muscle function is highly dependent on the ability to regenerate, however, during ageing or disease, the proliferative capacity is reduced, leading to loss of muscle function. We have previously demonstrated the presence of vitamin K2 in bovine skeletal muscles, but whether vitamin K has a role in muscle regulation and function is unknown. In this study, we used primary bovine skeletal muscle cells, cultured in monolayers &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, to assess a potential effect of vitamin K2 (MK-4) during myogenesis of muscle cells. Cell viability experiments demonstrate that the amount of ATP produced by the cells was unchanged when MK-4 was added, indicating viable cells. Cytotoxicity analysis show that MK-4 reduced the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the media, suggesting that MK-4 was beneficial to the muscle cells. Cell migration, proliferation and differentiation was characterised after MK-4 incubation using wound scratch analysis, immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR analysis. Adding MK-4 to the cells led to an increased muscle proliferation, increased gene expression of the myogenic transcription factor &lt;i&gt;myod&lt;/i&gt; as well as increased cell migration. In addition, we observed a reduction in the fusion index and relative gene expression of muscle differentiation markers, with fewer complex myotubes formed in MK-4 stimulated cells compared to control cells, indicating that the MK-4 plays a significant role during the early phases of muscle proliferation. Likewise, we see the same pattern for the relative gene expression of collagen 1A, showing increased gene expression in proliferating cells, and reduced expression in differentiating cells. Our results also suggest that MK-4 incubation affect low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) with a peak in gene expression after 45 min of MK-4 incubation. Altogether, our experiments show that MK-4 has a positive effect on muscle cell migration and proliferation, which are two important steps during early myogenesis.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57605:34f43e70</id><title>Vitamin K2 improves proliferation and migration of bovine skeletal muscle cells &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>27a51842</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sissel Beate Rønning, Mona Elisabeth Pedersen, Ragnhild Stenberg Berg, Bente Kirkhus, Rune Rødbotten&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Stroke-induced immunodepression is a well characterized complication of acute ischemic stroke. In experimental studies beta-blocker therapy reversed stroke-induced immunodepression, reduced infection rates and mortality. Recent, heterogeneous studies in stroke patients could not provide evidence of a protective effect of beta-blocker therapy. Aim of this study is to investigate the potential preventive effect of beta-blockers in subgroups of patients at high risk for stroke-induced immunodepression.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from a prospectively derived registry of major stroke patients receiving endovascular therapy between 2011–2017 in a tertiary stroke center (University Medical Center Göttingen. Germany) was used. The effect of beta-blocker therapy on pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sepsis and mortality was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three hundred six patients with a mean age of 72 ± 13 years and a median NIHSS of 16 (IQR 10.75–20) were included. 158 patients (51.6%) had pre-stroke- and continued beta-blocker therapy. Beta-blocker therapy did not reduce the incidence of pneumonia (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.31–1.92, p = 0.584), urinary tract infections (OR 1.51, 0.88–2.60, p = 0.135), sepsis (OR 0.57, 0.18–1.80, p = 0.334) or mortality (OR 0.59, 0.16–2.17, p = 0.429). Strokes involving the insula and anterio-medial cortex increased the risk for pneumonia (OR 4.55, 2.41–8.56, p&amp;lt;0.001) and sepsis (OR 4.13, 1.81–9.43, p = 0.001), while right hemispheric strokes increased the risk for pneumonia (OR 1.60, 0.92–2.77, p = 0.096). There was a non-significantly increased risk for urinary tract infections in patients with beta-blocker therapy and insula/anterio-medial cortex strokes (OR 3.12, 95% CI 0.88–11.05, p = 0.077) with no effect of beta-blocker therapy on pneumonia, sepsis or mortality in both subgroups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In major ischemic stroke patients, beta-blocker therapy did not lower post-stroke infection rates and was associated with urinary tract infections in a subgroup with insula/anterio-medial strokes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b5:91749e5b</id><title>Influence of beta-blocker therapy on the risk of infections and death in patients at high risk for stroke induced immunodepression</title><fingerprint>bdacedd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ilko L.

We test the hypothesis that prehistoric Native American land use influenced the Euro-American settlement process in a South Carolina Piedmont landscape. Long term ecological studies demonstrate that land use legacies influence processes and trajectories in complex, coupled social and ecological systems. Native American land use likely altered the ecological and evolutionary feedback and trajectories of many North American landscapes. Yet, considerable debate revolves around the scale and extent of land use legacies of prehistoric Native Americans. At the core of this debate is the question of whether or not European colonists settled a mostly “wild” landscape or an already “humanized” landscape. We use statistical event analysis to model the effects of prehistoric Native American settlement on the rate of Colonial land grants (1749–1775). Our results reveal how abandoned Native American settlements were among the first areas claimed and homesteaded by Euro-Americans. We suggest that prehistoric land use legacies served as key focal nodes in the Colonial era settlement process. As a consequence, localized prehistoric land use legacies likely helped structure the long term, landscape- to regional-level ecological inheritances that resulted from Euro-American settlement.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1d:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Influences of Native American land use on the Colonial Euro-American settlement of the South Carolina Piedmont</title><fingerprint>3d37712b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael R.

The assessment of competitive movement demands in team sports has traditionally relied upon global positioning system (GPS) analyses presented as fixed-time epochs (e.g., 5–40 min). More recently, presenting game data as a rolling average has become prevalent due to concerns over a loss of sampling resolution associated with the windowing of data over fixed periods. Accordingly, this study compared rolling average (ROLL) and fixed-time (FIXED) epochs for quantifying the peak movement demands of international rugby union match-play as a function of playing position. Elite players from three different squads (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 119) were monitored using 10 Hz GPS during 36 matches played in the 2014–2017 seasons. Players categorised broadly as forwards and backs, and then by positional sub-group (FR: front row, SR: second row, BR: back row, HB: half back, MF: midfield, B3: back three) were monitored during match-play for peak values of high-speed running (&gt;5 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; HSR) and relative distance covered (m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) over 60–300 s using two types of sample-epoch (ROLL, FIXED). Irrespective of the method used, as the epoch length increased, values for the intensity of running actions decreased (e.g., For the backs using the ROLL method, distance covered decreased from 177.4 ± 20.6 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the 60 s epoch to 107.5 ± 13.3 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for the 300 s epoch). For the team as a whole, and irrespective of position, estimates of fixed effects indicated significant between-method differences across all time-points for both relative distance covered and HSR. Movement demands were underestimated consistently by FIXED versus ROLL with differences being most pronounced using 60 s epochs (95% CI HSR: -6.05 to -4.70 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 95% CI distance: -18.45 to -16.43 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). For all HSR time epochs except one, all backs groups increased more (p &amp;lt; 0.01) from FIXED to ROLL than the forward groups. Linear mixed modelling of ROLL data highlighted that for HSR (except 60 s epoch), SR was the only group not significantly different to FR. For relative distance covered all other position groups were greater than the FR (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The FIXED method underestimated both relative distance (~11%) and HSR values (up to ~20%) compared to the ROLL method. These differences were exaggerated for the HSR variable in the backs position who covered the greatest HSR distance; highlighting important consideration for those implementing the FIXED method of analysis. The data provides coaches with a worst-case scenario reference on the running demands required for periods of 60–300 s in length. This information offers novel insight into game demands and can be used to inform the design of training games to increase specificity of preparation for the most demanding phases of matches.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4602:34f43e70</id><title>Assessing worst case scenarios in movement demands derived from global positioning systems during international rugby union matches: Rolling averages versus fixed length epochs</title><fingerprint>12889cec</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel J.

In the United States (US), the sugarcane aphid (SCA) &lt;i&gt;Melanaphis sacchari&lt;/i&gt; (Zehnter) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was introduced in the 1970s, however at that time it was only considered a pest of sugarcane. In 2013, a massive outbreak of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sacchari&lt;/i&gt; occured on sorghum, resulting in significant economic damage to sorghum grown in North America including the US, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The aim of the present study was to determine if the SCA pest emergence in American sorghum resulted from the introduction of new genotypes. To this end we used microsatellite markers and COI sequencing to compare the genetic diversity of SCA populations collected in the Americas after the 2013 SCA outbreak on sorghum (during 2013–2017) to older samples collected before the pest outbreak (during 2007–2009). Our results show that the SCA outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean observed since 2013 belong to populations exhibiting low genetic diversity and consisting of a dominant clonal lineage, MLL-F, which colonizes &lt;i&gt;Sorghum&lt;/i&gt; spp. and sugarcane. The comparison of MLL-F specimens collected post-2013 with specimens collected in Louisiana in 2007 revealed that both populations are genetically distinct, according to COI sequencing and microsatellite data analyses. Our result suggest that MLL-F is a new invasive genotype introduced into the Americas that has spread rapidly across sorghum growing regions in the US, Mexico, Honduras and the Caribbean. The origin of this introduction is either Africa or Asia, with Asia being the most probable source.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b0:91749e5b</id><title>Invasion of sorghum in the Americas by a new sugarcane aphid (&amp;lt;i&gt;Melanaphis sacchari&amp;lt;/i&gt;) superclone</title><fingerprint>d320a996</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Nibouche, Laurent Costet, Jocelyn R.

Rapid oxidation in mountain soils drives CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24616-4</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/kOEj_8F1HD4/s41598-018-24616-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24616-4</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Julia Nagel</name></author><published>1524034800000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24616-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1524043206589</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24616-4/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24616_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>451</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stem cells in middle ear cholesteatoma contribute to its pathogenesis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stem cells in middle ear cholesteatoma contribute to its pathogenesis, Published online: 18 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24616-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24616-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stem cells in middle ear cholesteatoma contribute to its pathogenesis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/kOEj_8F1HD4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162d80dcfbd:399b48c:9f3b30f2</id><title>Stem cells in middle ear cholesteatoma contribute to its pathogenesis</title><fingerprint>5fd59c27</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stem cells in middle ear cholesteatoma contribute to its pathogenesis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stem cells in middle ear cholesteatoma contribute to its pathogenesis, Published online: 18 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24616-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24616-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stem cells in middle ear cholesteatoma contribute to its pathogenesis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/kOEj_8F1HD4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3606.short?rss=1</link><keywords><item>Letters</item></keywords><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3606.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3606.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3606</canonicalUrl><author><name>Yueh-hsiu Chien</name></author><published>1523990209000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523994445149</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>In a recent publication entitled “Role of a selecting ligand in shaping the murine γδ-TCR repertoire,” Fahl et al.

Background &lt;p&gt;Multiple drug resistant (MDR) intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are associated with notable direct and societal costs. As previous studies have not considered the impact of MDR on the total medical costs (TMCs) of IAIs, the present one examines this, as well as further estimates the additional costs at a national level.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective study. Firstly, we randomly selected a sample of 40% of all inpatients discharged between 2014 and 2015 from a teaching hospital, due to limits in budget and the large number of patients. Then, we manually selected 254 patients with IAIs according to the International Classification of Disease, 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; revision, using electronic medical records. Eventually, 101 patients with IAIs (64 MDR patients and 37 non-MDR patients) were included after excluding cases without laboratory test results, any pathogens detected, or antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Univariate analysis and a generalized linear model were applied to assess the parameters associated with TMCs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to non-MDR patients, those with MDR pathogens were significantly associated with higher TMCs, higher antimicrobial costs, higher antimicrobial usage, larger number of pathogens, and longer length of stay and were more likely to have insurance and combination antimicrobial therapy. In addition, the average TMC among patients with MDR pathogens was ¥ 131801, which is ¥ 90201 higher than those without MDR pathogens. If our results are applied to the whole country, the sum of all attributable TMCs was ¥ 37 billion. The societal costs, furthermore, were ¥111 billion in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results provide information that should lead to increased efforts to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, in order to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens and to reduce their economic burden.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad280b:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Effect of multiple drug resistance on total medical costs among patients with intra-abdominal infections in China</title><fingerprint>35d306d4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xuemei Zhen, Yuanyuan Li, Yixi Chen, Peng Dong, Stephanie Liu, Hengjin Dong&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Data on implications of a high positive titer of serum anti-&lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; antibody on gastric cancer (GC) is limited. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of GC with a high serum anti-&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; IgG (Hp-IgG) titer, and its association with diffuse-type GC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical and histological characteristics of 917 non-cardia GC patients who underwent gastrectomy. &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection was determined serologically by measuring Hp-IgG titer with immunoassay. Seropositive patients were divided into three groups (low-positive, mid-positive, and high-positive) according to the Hp-IgG titer value. Tumors were classified according to the Lauren criteria as diffuse or intestinal types.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median age of the patients was 59.0 years, and 33.8% were female. The patents were grouped as follows: seronegative, 188 (20.5%); low-positive, 288 (31.4%); mid-positive, 290 (31.6%); and high-positive 151 (16.5%). The high-positive group was significantly younger (median age, 55.0 years), with a higher proportion of female (45.0%) and non-smokers (58.9%). The proportion of diffuse-type GC increased in the order low-, mid-, and high-positive groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). In univariate analysis, the factors associated with diffuse-type GC were younger age, female sex, non-smokers, and a high-positive Hp-IgG titer. Younger age, female sex, and non-smokers remained significant on multivariate analysis whereas the high-positive Hp-IgG titer showed only a tendency toward the association (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.078).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Non-cardia GC patients with a high Hp-IgG titer have distinct clinicopathologic characteristics. A high-positive Hp-IgG titer should be interpreted together with patients’ age, sex, and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4606:34f43e70</id><title>Characteristics of non-cardia gastric cancer with a high serum anti-&amp;lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&amp;lt;/i&gt; IgG titer and its association with diffuse-type histology</title><fingerprint>80825a6e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eun Jeong Gong, Ji Young Lee, Suh Eun Bae, Young Soo Park, Kee Don Choi, Ho June Song, Gin Hyug Lee, Hwoon-Yong Jung, Woo Jin Jeong, Gab Jin Cheon, Jeong Hwan Yook, Byung Sik Kim&lt;/p&gt;

The high-positive group was significantly younger (median age, 55.0 years), with a higher proportion of female (45.0%) and non-smokers (58.9%). The proportion of diffuse-type GC increased in the order low-, mid-, and high-positive groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). In univariate analysis, the factors associated with diffuse-type GC were younger age, female sex, non-smokers, and a high-positive Hp-IgG titer. Younger age, female sex, and non-smokers remained significant on multivariate analysis whereas the high-positive Hp-IgG titer showed only a tendency toward the association (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.078).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Non-cardia GC patients with a high Hp-IgG titer have distinct clinicopathologic characteristics. A high-positive Hp-IgG titer should be interpreted together with patients’ age, sex, and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00078</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00078/20180413/images/medium/ct-2018-00078f_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00078&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The phytohormones auxin and cytokinin control development and maintenance of plant meristems and stem cell systems. Fluorescent protein reporter lines that monitor phytohormone controlled gene expression programmes have been widely used to study development and differentiation in the model species Arabidopsis, but equivalent tools are still missing for the majority of crop species. Barley (&lt;i&gt;Hordeum vulgare&lt;/i&gt;) is the fourth most abundant cereal crop plant, but knowledge on these important phytohormones in regard to the barley root and shoot stem cell niches is still negligible. We have now analysed the role of auxin and cytokinin in barley root meristem development, and present fluorescent protein reporter lines that allow to dissect auxin and cytokinin signalling outputs in vivo. We found that application of either auxin or cytokinin to barley seedlings negatively impacts root meristem growth. We further established a barley cytokinin reporter, &lt;i&gt;TCSnew&lt;/i&gt;, which revealed significant cytokinin signalling in the stele cells proximal to the QC, and in the differentiated root cap cells. Application of exogenous cytokinin activated signalling in the root stem cell niche. Commonly employed auxin reporters DR5 or DR5v2 failed to respond to auxin in barley. However, analysis of putative auxin signalling targets barley PLETHORA1 (HvPLT1) is expressed in a similar pattern as its orthologue AtPLT1 from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. in the QC and the surrounding cells. Furthermore, the PINFORMED1 (HvPIN1) auxin efflux carrier was found to be expressed in root and shoot meristems, where it polarly localized to the plasma membrane. HvPIN1 expression is negatively regulated by cytokinin and its intracellular localisation is sensitive to brefeldinA (BFA). With this study, we provide the first fluorescent reporter lines as a tool to study auxin and cytokinin signalling and response pathways in barley.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67ad:91749e5b</id><title>Fluorescent reporter lines for auxin and cytokinin signalling in barley (&amp;lt;i&gt;Hordeum vulgare&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><fingerprint>8e73c12e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gwendolyn K.

The poorly understood mechanisms of dry season persistence of &lt;i&gt;Anopheles&lt;/i&gt; spp. mosquitoes through the dry season in Africa remain a critical gap in our knowledge of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; disease transmission. While it is thought that adult mosquitoes remain in a dormant state throughout this seven-month dry season, the nature of this state remains unknown and has largely not been recapitulated in laboratory settings. To elucidate possible connections of this state with microbial composition, the whole body microbiomes of adult mosquitoes in the dry and wet seasons in two locations of Mali with varying water availability were compared by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. These locations were a village near the Niger River with year-round water sources (N’Gabakoro, “riparian”), and a typical Sahelian area with highly seasonal breeding sites (Thierola Area, “Sahelian”). The 16S bacterial data consisted of 2057 sequence variants in 426 genera across 184 families. From these data, we found several compositional differences that were seasonally and spatially linked. Counter to our initial hypothesis, there were more pronounced seasonal differences in the bacterial microbiome of riparian, rather than Sahelian areas. These seasonal shifts were primarily in &lt;i&gt;Ralstonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sphingorhabdus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Duganella&lt;/i&gt; spp. bacteria that are usually soil and water-associated, indicating these changes may be from bacteria acquired in the larval environment, rather than adulthood. In Sahelian dry season mosquitoes, there was a unique intracellular bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Anaplasma&lt;/i&gt;, which likely was acquired through non-human blood feeding. Cytochrome B analysis of blood meals showed greater heterogeneity in host choice of &lt;i&gt;An&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coluzzii&lt;/i&gt; independent of season in the Thierola area compared to N’Gabakoro (77.5% vs. 94.6% human-origin blood meal, respectively), indicating a relaxation of anthropophily. Overall, this exploratory study provides valuable indications of spatial and seasonal differences in bacterial composition which help refine this difficult to study state.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef07:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Investigation of the seasonal microbiome of &amp;lt;i&gt;Anopheles coluzzii&amp;lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes in Mali</title><fingerprint>a174f829</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin J.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In light of the limited impact the syndromic management approach has had on the global sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic, we assessed a care model comprising point-of-care (POC) STI testing, immediate treatment, and expedited partner therapy (EPT) among a cohort of young women at high HIV risk in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;HIV negative women presenting for STI care underwent POC testing for &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT), &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; (NG) and &lt;i&gt;Trichomonas vaginalis&lt;/i&gt; (TV), and swabs were sent for NG culture and susceptibility testing. Results were available within 2 hours and women with STIs were immediately treated and offered EPT packs, including medication, condoms, and information for sexual partners. An EPT questionnaire was administered after one week, and women retested for STIs after 6 and 12 weeks. 267 women, median age 23 (IQR 21–26), were recruited and 88.4% (236/267) reported genital symptoms. STI prevalence was CT 18.4% (95%CI 13.7–23.0), NG 5.2% (95%CI 2.6–7.9) and TV 3.0% (95%CI 1.0–5.0). After 12 weeks, all but one NG and two CT infections were cleared. No cephalosporin-resistant NG was detected. Of 63/267 women (23.6%) diagnosed with STIs, 98.4% (62/63) were offered and 87.1% (54/62) accepted EPT. At one week 88.9% (48/54) stated that their partner had taken the medication. No allergic reactions or social harms were reported. Of 51 women completing 6-week follow up, detection rates were lower amongst women receiving EPT (2.2%, 1/46) compared to those who did not (40.0%, 2/5), p = 0.023. During focus group discussions women supported the care model, because they received a rapid, specific diagnosis, and could facilitate their partners’ treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;POC STI testing and EPT were acceptable to young South African women and their partners, and could play an important role in reducing STI reinfection rates and HIV risk. Larger studies should evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of implementing this strategy at population level.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa1:34f43e70</id><title>Beyond syndromic management: Opportunities for diagnosis-based treatment of sexually transmitted infections in low- and middle-income countries</title><fingerprint>c96dfc77</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nigel J.

STI prevalence was CT 18.4% (95%CI 13.7–23.0), NG 5.2% (95%CI 2.6–7.9) and TV 3.0% (95%CI 1.0–5.0). After 12 weeks, all but one NG and two CT infections were cleared. No cephalosporin-resistant NG was detected. Of 63/267 women (23.6%) diagnosed with STIs, 98.4% (62/63) were offered and 87.1% (54/62) accepted EPT. At one week 88.9% (48/54) stated that their partner had taken the medication. No allergic reactions or social harms were reported. Of 51 women completing 6-week follow up, detection rates were lower amongst women receiving EPT (2.2%, 1/46) compared to those who did not (40.0%, 2/5), p = 0.023. During focus group discussions women supported the care model, because they received a rapid, specific diagnosis, and could facilitate their partners’ treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;POC STI testing and EPT were acceptable to young South African women and their partners, and could play an important role in reducing STI reinfection rates and HIV risk. Larger studies should evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of implementing this strategy at population level.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291799v2?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291799v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291799v2?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/291799.1</canonicalUrl><author><name>O&apos;Shea, K.</name></author><published>1522393200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522432016295</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Metabolomics involves the characterisation, identification, and quantification of small molecules (metabolites) that act as the reaction intermediates of biological processes.

This should surprise no one at all, but it’s good to have some quantitative data on the problem. There are limitations to the study – for one thing, it’s quite possible that (self-selected) respondents were among those more likely to have experienced these problems. The survey was done across 26 different countries (over 2200 respondents), 70% female/28% male/2% transgender, and the fields of study involved were 56% humanities and 38% physical sciences – no breakdown of the numbers by these categories is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these reservations, I have no trouble believing the overall conclusions – based on my own experience and my observations since, I think that anxiety and depression are &lt;em&gt;very close to inevitable&lt;/em&gt; in graduate study, and that students should be aware of what they’re getting into. What’s happening, in any field, is the rubber finally meeting the road: you’re not just sitting in classrooms; you’re doing what practitioners of your chosen line of work actually do, and you’re finding out what that’s really like and whether or not you’re any good at it. If that doesn’t bring on the occasional bout of anxiety and self-doubt, then something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from that to depression is not such a huge jump, either. All of us who have been through grad school have seen people who sort of freeze up at some point in their progress. Sometimes it happens near the beginning, such as when chemistry graduate students move out of classes and into the labs – some of them just can’t seem to get anything going. I remember people who were always just about to start something, just about to figure out what went wrong with the last thing (which was spread out into a bunch of inconclusive samples around their hoods), just about to really start making some progress. But they never did. Later in the process, another familiar figure is the person who’s been hanging around for years in the lab, running ever more experiments to avoid writing up, as is their near-relative, the person who’s actually out of the lab, writing up that dissertation/thesis, expected to set a defense date pretty soon. . .and who in the end, is never heard from again after a while, finding themselves unable to get the thing done. After a while, the official notices from the department come back stamped “Addressee unknown”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression might well be a good description of what’s going on in many of these situations. Someone finds themselves in an untenable situation and sinks into a state that makes it more untenable every day. David Foster Wallace defined a harmful addiction as something that offered itself as the remedy for the problems that it itself was causing (as with alcohol), and the downward-spiral mode of life has some similarities, as a big factor in what put you into this spot makes you ever less likely to do anything about it. The canonical view of major depression from the inside is William Styron’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2pFf7lZ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darkness Visible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but you don’t have to be as far along as Styron was to be in real trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I got quite as far as depression myself, but there’s no doubt that I was under significant stress. Even the stock of stories that I have from grad school illustrates that. So many of them feature me losing my temper about something, and honestly, I rarely do that out here in the real world. I well recall unnerving bouts of fear and uncertainty, wondering if I was doing the right thing with my life, wondering if it was too late to do much about that even if I were, wondering if my research was any good or if I was any good at doing it, and what I was going to do about it if the answer to either or both of those were actually “No”. And so on. By the end of it, I was thoroughly sick of my project, wildly ready to get out the door and see what the post-doc life was going to be like (and very much wondering if it would turn out to be more of the same, in a different location).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw some outright breakdowns while I was in grad school – there’s no other way to describe them. In some cases a person’s hours and behavior would become erratic, their actions hard to understand or predict. Sometimes in these the ship would apparently right itself and sometimes it wouldn’t. I saw examples of just those situations mentioned above, with people unable to make a real start in research or unable to write up at the end of it. And there was one flat-out suicide attempt, very nearly successful and permanently damaging to the person involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my own worst moments, I would be standing there in the lab feeling like a pitcher out on the mound who had just shaken off every pitch he knew how to throw. I was hauling material up the mountainside of a long linear synthesis, and I was frustrated to a degree beyond anything I’d ever experienced. I didn’t feel like working up the reactions in front of me, and I didn’t feel like setting up others. Waiting for me was my reward at the end of twenty-odd linear steps, the chance to risk all my hard work by trying (finally) some new chemistry that would probably not work and might well destroy my starting material in the process. Oh joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve told this next story before, but can’t track down the post where I did. At any rate, a pivotal moment was when I was bashing along with the largest load of starting material I’d ever made. Up at around step 9 (I was still in liter-sized flask territory) I was ready to work up the whole batch after a late-night reaction. I added some ammonium chloride and extracted the black mixture. That didn’t worry me; it was always black. I evaporated it down to a bunch of black oil and loaded it on a big gravity column of coarse silica gel – from prior runs, I knew that would hold the black crud at the top and allow a big yellow band of product to elute. Except this time the whole column turned black. Must have overloaded the column with this big pile of material, I thought. I collected a bunch of black fractions and rota-vapped them down, only to find what I sort of thought was a lot less oil than I’d been expecting. Reserving worry, I set up another column on that stuff, and this time the whole column turned black again, and nothing at all came out the other end but slightly discolored solvent. I had, in fact, destroyed my entire huge batch, because at 2 AM I was too groggy to remember that I was supposed to work it up with saturated bicarb, not ammonium chloride. All gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood there, alone, in the middle of the night, looking at all the mess I’d created. Ruined, all that batch of material that was going to finally get my synthesis finished and get me out of this place. I shook my head, cursed loudly, and went home, and to my surprise I fell asleep fairly quickly. What else was there to do? I woke up the next morning and went through that terrible disorienting feeling when after a few seconds you suddenly remember that something bad happened the night before. And then I got up and went to the lab, and set up an even larger batch back at the beginning of the synthesis, step one. Looking back, that night and that morning were a key episode in my graduate career and my life in general, because that batch I started that next day really did get me out in the end. I had bent and come very close to breaking at times, but it turned out that the worst had happened and I was still in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things definitely could have gone in other ways, though, and if they had there’s no telling where I would be now or what I would be doing. If that incident had happened to me a year before, I don’t know how I would have taken it. By the time I speak of, I had my eyes on the door and a PhD defense, having decided that the shortest way out of this awful situation was in that direction. I was devoting all my efforts to it, in an “OK, did today get me closer to defending, or not?” sort of way. Earlier, though, I was too far from the beginning and too far from the end to have that mindset, and a whopping failure would not have gone down well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important for graduate students to realize that &lt;em&gt;everyone has these doubts and bad stretches&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone has these moments when they wonder what they’ve done to their lives, but having these thoughts is &lt;em&gt;not a sign&lt;/em&gt; that the exact failure you’re fearing has arrived. That doesn’t mean that thinking about your purpose in grad school is a bad thing, but it probably is a bad thing to try to do it at periods of peak emotional stress. If you feel that it really is getting too much, definitely talk to someone. Universities have people around for just that purpose – more so than in my day, fortunately – and if you find yourself wondering if you should reach out like that, then odds are that you should. Do it. I wish some of the people I worked with had, or had been able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any meaningful graduate degree is going to be a test of your abilities and your resilience. Recognize this, and avoid the two extremes. On one end are the macho types whose response is “Eat stress for breakfast! That’s what I did in my day! If you don’t have the fire in your belly you don’t belong here!”. And on the other end are the voices, some perhaps external and some internal, telling you that you’re a failure already, an imposter, and that you’re never going to measure up anyway. These are two different sets of lies, and everyone has to steer their course between them.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162629ce0bc:5b03560:9f3b30f2</id><title>Depression and Anxiety in Graduate School</title><fingerprint>2809f37c</fingerprint><description>According to this new survey, depression and anxiety are far more common among graduate students than in the general population.

The fungal genus &lt;i&gt;Colletotrichum&lt;/i&gt; contains hemibiotrophic phytopathogens being highly variable in host and tissue specificities. We sequenced a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fructicola&lt;/i&gt; genome (1104–7) derived from an isolate of apple in China and compared it with the reference genome (Nara_gc5) derived from an isolate of strawberry in Japan. Mauve alignment and BlastN search identified 0.62 Mb lineage-specific (LS) genomic regions in 1104–7 with a length criterion of 10 kb. Genes located within LS regions evolved more dynamically, and a strongly elevated proportion of genes were closely related to non-&lt;i&gt;Colletotrichum&lt;/i&gt; sequences. Two LS regions, containing nine genes in total, showed features of fungus-to-fungus horizontal transfer supported by both gene order collinearity and gene phylogeny patterns. We further compared the gene content variations among 13 &lt;i&gt;Colletotrichum&lt;/i&gt; and 11 non-&lt;i&gt;Colletotrichum&lt;/i&gt; genomes by gene function annotation, OrthoMCL grouping and CAFE analysis. The results provided a global evolutionary picture of &lt;i&gt;Colletotrichum&lt;/i&gt; gene families, and identified a number of strong duplication/loss events at key phylogenetic nodes, such as the contraction of the detoxification-related RTA1 family in the monocot-specializing graminicola complex and the expansions of several ammonia production-related families in the fruit-infecting gloeosporioides complex. We have also identified the acquirement of a RbsD/FucU fucose transporter from bacterium by the &lt;i&gt;Colletotrichum&lt;/i&gt; ancestor.

On a daily basis, planktonic organisms migrate vertically and thus experience widely varying conditions in their physico-chemical environment. In the Gulf of Finland, these changes are larger than values predicted by climate change scenarios predicted for the next century (up to 0.5 units in pH and 5°C in temperature). In this work, we are interested in how temporal variations in physico-chemical characteristics of the water column on a daily and weekly scale influence oxidative stress level and antioxidant responses in the planktonic copepod of the genus &lt;i&gt;Acartia&lt;/i&gt;. Responses were determined from samples collected during a two-week field survey in the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Our results showed that GST (Glutathione-S-transferase) enzyme activity increased in the surface waters between Weeks I and II, indicating antioxidant defense mechanism activation. This is most likely due to elevating temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen observed between these two weeks.

On a daily basis, planktonic organisms migrate vertically and thus experience widely varying conditions in their physico-chemical environment. In the Gulf of Finland, these changes are larger than values predicted by climate change scenarios predicted for the next century (up to 0.5 units in pH and 5°C in temperature). In this work, we are interested in how temporal variations in physico-chemical characteristics of the water column on a daily and weekly scale influence oxidative stress level and antioxidant responses in the planktonic copepod of the genus &lt;i&gt;Acartia&lt;/i&gt;. Responses were determined from samples collected during a two-week field survey in the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Our results showed that GST (Glutathione-S-transferase) enzyme activity increased in the surface waters between Weeks I and II, indicating antioxidant defense mechanism activation. This is most likely due to elevating temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen observed between these two weeks. During Week II also GSSG (oxidized glutathione) was detected, indicating that copepods responded to stressor(s) in the environment. Our results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Acartia&lt;/i&gt; copepods seem fairly tolerant to weekly fluctuations in environmental conditions in coastal and estuarine areas, in terms of antioxidant defense and oxidative stress. This could be directly connected to a very efficient glutathione cycling system acting as antioxidant defense system for neutralizing ROS and avoiding elevated levels of LPX.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24101-y</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/E5bP5FIhEQY/s41598-018-24101-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24101-y</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Sicong Wang</name></author><published>1524121200000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24101-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1524090041631</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24101-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24101-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/E5bP5FIhEQY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162dad8751f:3ea39da:9f3b30f2</id><title>Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing</title><fingerprint>75665880</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24101-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24101-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/E5bP5FIhEQY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195880</link><updated>1523566800000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195880</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Sarah-Jo Paquette</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195880</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195880</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1523566800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah-Jo Paquette, Kim Stanford, James Thomas, Tim Reuter&lt;/p&gt;
Often &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; are harmless and/or beneficial bacteria inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of livestock and humans. However, Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) have been linked to human disease. Cattle are the primary reservoir for STEC and STEC “super-shedders” are considered to be a major contributor in animal to animal transmission. Among STEC, O157:H7 is the most recognized serotype, but in recent years, non-O157 STEC have been increasingly linked to human disease. In Argentina and Germany, O178 is considered an emerging pathogen. Our objective was to compare populations of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178, O157, shiga toxin 1 and 2 in western Canadian cattle feces from a sampling pool of ~80,000 beef cattle collected at two slaughterhouses. Conventional PCR was utilized to screen 1,773 samples for presence/absence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178. A subset of samples (n = 168) was enumerated using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and proportions of O178, O157 and shiga toxins 1 &amp;amp; 2 specific-fragments were calculated as a proportion of generic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (GEC) specific-fragments. Distribution of &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was determined by comparing &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O157 enumerations. Conventional PCR detected the presence of O178 in 873 of 1,773 samples and ddPCR found the average proportion of O178, O157, &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the samples 2.8%, 0.6%, 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively. Quantification of &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; revealed more virulence genes than could be exclusively attributed to O157. Our results confirmed the presence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178 in western Canadian cattle and ddPCR revealed O178 as a greater proportion of GEC than was O157.

Some components of the neural circuits underlying innate odor-evoked responses have recently been elucidated. Odor information detected by the olfactory receptors is transmitted from the olfactory bulb to the cortical amygdala, where physiological and emotional states such as attraction or avoidance are controlled. Thus, activation of specific olfactory receptors can elicit changes in physiological and/or psychological state. Here, we examined on the odorant Hex-Hex Mix, which has been reported to induce anti-fatigue effects. Fatigue is a prevalent condition that is often related to overwork and psychological stress. Various anti-fatigue treatments have been developed, including supplements and odorants. However, the mechanisms underlying the anti-fatigue effects of these substances are currently unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the involvement of the olfactory system in the mechanisms underlying this effect. We identified the human olfactory receptors activated by Hex-Hex Mix, and evaluated whether activation of these olfactory receptors by a newly developed odorant elicited a similar anti-fatigue effect to Hex-Hex Mix. We assessed anti-fatigue effects with behavioral tests, and 17 healthy males performed the 2-back test as a fatigue-inducing task with or without exposure to the new odorant. Immediately before and after the task, participants performed a cognitive task to evaluate their level of mental fatigue. We found that the difference value of the correct response rate on the cognitive task in the evaluation session was significantly different between in the odorant condition and in the without-odorant condition during the fatigue-inducing session suggesting that the new odorant may improve performance in the fatigue-inducing condition. The results indicated that the new odorant activates the same olfactory receptors as Hex-Hex Mix, which has been reported to induce anti-fatigue effects. Our findings suggest that the olfactory receptors in the olfactory system may be involved in the attenuation of fatigue.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde30:9f3b30f2</id><title>Involvement of the olfactory system in the induction of anti-fatigue effects by odorants</title><fingerprint>f52c8f06</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naoko Saito, Emi Yamano, Akira Ishii, Masaaki Tanaka, Junji Nakamura, Yasuyoshi Watanabe&lt;/p&gt;

Vibrations are important cues for tactile perception across species. Whisker-based sensation in mice is a powerful model system for investigating mechanisms of tactile perception. However, the role vibration plays in whisker-based sensation remains unsettled, in part due to difficulties in modeling the vibration of whiskers. Here, we develop an analytical approach to calculate the vibrations of whiskers striking objects. We use this approach to quantify vibration forces during active whisker touch at a range of locations along the whisker. The frequency and amplitude of vibrations evoked by contact are strongly dependent on the position of contact along the whisker. The magnitude of vibrational shear force and bending moment is comparable to quasi-static forces. The fundamental vibration frequencies are in a detectable range for mechanoreceptor properties and below the maximum spike rates of primary sensory afferents. These results suggest two dynamic cues exist that rodents can use for object localization: vibration frequency and comparison of vibrational to quasi-static force magnitude. These complement the use of quasi-static force angle as a distance cue, particularly for touches close to the follicle, where whiskers are stiff and force angles hardly change during touch. Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oRjfKRlw_io&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162688e2a3c:4d823:a077e55f</id><title>Dynamic cues for whisker-based object localization: An analytical solution to vibration during active whisker touch</title><fingerprint>c4a8f063</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Vaxenburg, Isis Wyche, Karel Svoboda, Alexander L.

We investigated how visual and kinaesthetic/efferent information is integrated for speed perception in running. Twelve moderately trained to trained subjects ran on a treadmill at three different speeds (8, 10, 12 km/h) in front of a moving virtual scene. They were asked to match the visual speed of the scene to their running speed–i.e., treadmill’s speed. For each trial, participants indicated whether the scene was moving slower or faster than they were running. Visual speed was adjusted according to their response using a staircase until the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) was reached, i.e., until visual and running speed were perceived as equivalent. For all three running speeds, participants systematically underestimated the visual speed relative to their actual running speed. Indeed, the speed of the visual scene had to exceed the actual running speed in order to be perceived as equivalent to the treadmill speed. The underestimation of visual speed was speed-dependent, and percentage of underestimation relative to running speed ranged from 15% at 8km/h to 31% at 12km/h. We suggest that this fact should be taken into consideration to improve the design of attractive treadmill-mediated virtual environments enhancing engagement into physical activity for healthier lifestyles and disease prevention and care.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d5:34f43e70</id><title>Matching optical flow to motor speed in virtual reality while running on a treadmill</title><fingerprint>7fb183c6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Caramenti, Claudio L.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with inflammation. We tried to investigate the influence of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and tocilizumab (TCZ) on the glucose metabolism of RA patients. RA patients in whom treatment with TNFi or TCZ was initiated from 2008 to 2015 were studied based on their medical records. We analyzed patients whose glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured both before and 3 months after the initiation of these biologic agents. The association between HbA1c reduction and the treatment was evaluated. From 971 cases treated with these biologic agents, 221 cases whose medical records of HbA1c were available, were included (TNFi, n = 154; TCZ, n = 67). Both the TNFi and TCZ groups had significantly lower HbA1c values at 1 month and 3 months after the initiation of treatment (TNFi, p&amp;lt;0.001; TCZ, p&amp;lt;0.001). Although the pretreatment HbA1c values did not differ (TNFi, 6.2%; TCZ, 6.2%; p = 0.532), the 3-month treatment HbA1c values were lower (TNFi, 6.1%; TCZ, 5.8%; p = 0.010) and the changes in HbA1c (ΔHbA1c) were greater (TNFi, 0.1%; TCZ, 0.4%; p&amp;lt;0.001) in the TCZ group. The reduction of HbA1c—defined by the achievement of a ΔHbA1c of ≥0.5%—was associated with baseline diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, baseline diabetes treatment, hospitalization, medical change during the observation period, and TCZ. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, TCZ was associated with the reduction of HbA1c in comparison to TNFi (adjusted OR = 5.59, 95% CI = 2.56–12.2; p&amp;lt;0.001). The HbA1c levels in RA patients were significantly lower after the initiation of TNFi or TCZ. Our study suggests that TCZ decreases the HbA1c levels in RA patients to a greater extent than TNFi.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67bf:91749e5b</id><title>Effects of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and tocilizumab on the glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; an observational study</title><fingerprint>657a43f0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yukimi Otsuka, Chikako Kiyohara, Yusuke Kashiwado, Takuya Sawabe, Shuji Nagano, Yasutaka Kimoto, Masahiro Ayano, Hiroki Mitoma, Mitsuteru Akahoshi, Yojiro Arinobu, Hiroaki Niiro, Koichi Akashi, Takahiko Horiuchi&lt;/p&gt;

In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, TCZ was associated with the reduction of HbA1c in comparison to TNFi (adjusted OR = 5.59, 95% CI = 2.56–12.2; p&amp;lt;0.001). The HbA1c levels in RA patients were significantly lower after the initiation of TNFi or TCZ. Our study suggests that TCZ decreases the HbA1c levels in RA patients to a greater extent than TNFi.</description></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11998</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b11998/20180409/images/medium/jp-2017-119985_0003.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11998&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Levothyroxine replacement treatment in hypothyroidism is unable to restore physiological thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations in serum and tissues completely. Normal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations reflect only pituitary euthyroidism and, therefore, novel biomarkers representing tissue-specific thyroid state are needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding regulatory RNAs, exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns and can be detectable in serum. Previous studies have demonstrated differential expression of (precursors of) miRNAs in tissues under the influence of thyroid hormone.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To study if serum miRNA profiles are changed in different thyroid states.&lt;/p&gt; Design and methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 13 athyroid patients (6 males) during TSH suppressive therapy and after 4 weeks of thyroid hormone withdrawal. A magnetic bead capture system was used to isolate 384 defined miRNAs from serum. Subsequently, the TaqMan Array Card 3.0 platform was used for profiling after individual target amplification.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age of the subjects was 44.0 years (range 20–61 years). Median TSH levels were 88.9 mU/l during levothyroxine withdrawal and 0.006 mU/l during LT4 treatment with a median dosage of 2.1 μg/kg. After normalization to allow inter-sample analysis, a paired analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in expression of any of the 384 miRNAs analyzed on and off LT4 treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Although we previously showed an up-regulation of pri-miRNAs 133b and 206 in hypothyroid state in skeletal muscle, the present study does not supply evidence that thyroid state also affects serum miRNAs in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7127:34f43e70</id><title>Serum microRNA profiles in athyroid patients on and off levothyroxine therapy</title><fingerprint>78447b54</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elske T.

Neurons require a nearly constant supply of ATP. Glucose is the predominant source of brain ATP, but the direct effects of prolonged glucose deprivation on neuronal viability and function remain unclear. In sparse rat hippocampal microcultures, neurons were surprisingly resilient to 16 h glucose removal in the absence of secondary excitotoxicity. Neuronal survival and synaptic transmission were unaffected by prolonged removal of exogenous glucose. Inhibition of lactate transport decreased microculture neuronal survival during concurrent glucose deprivation, suggesting that endogenously released lactate is important for tolerance to glucose deprivation. Tandem depolarization and glucose deprivation also reduced neuronal survival, and trace glucose concentrations afforded neuroprotection. Mass cultures, in contrast to microcultures, were insensitive to depolarizing glucose deprivation, a difference attributable to increased extracellular lactate levels. Removal of local astrocyte support did not reduce survival in response to glucose deprivation or alter evoked excitatory transmission, suggesting that on-demand, local lactate shuttling is not necessary for neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose removal. Taken together, these data suggest that endogenously produced lactate available globally in the extracellular milieu sustains neurons in the absence of glucose. A better understanding of resilience mechanisms in reduced preparations could lead to therapeutic strategies aimed to bolster these mechanisms in vulnerable neuronal populations.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ec8:9f3b30f2</id><title>Ambient but not local lactate underlies neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose deprivation</title><fingerprint>7698fc0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Courtney Sobieski, Natasha Warikoo, Hong-Jin Shu, Steven Mennerick&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of the present study is to differentiate subtypes of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) using ex vivo ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Included were 14 surgically resected hippocampi of patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The resected hippocampi were histologically categorized into subtypes of hippocampal sclerosis (HS type 1 (n = 10), HS type 2 (n = 2) and no-HS (n = 2)) and subsequently scanned on a preclinical 7T MRI acquiring T2-weighted morphology, relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging. On the morphological images, the pyramidal cell layer (PCL) of the hippocampus was segmented and the following parameters were derived: T2 signal intensity, T1-, T2- and T2*-relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Furthermore, the area of the PCL was determined, as well as the parameter product which refers to the widths of the PCL parallel and perpendicular to the stratum moleculare. Spearman correlation coefficient was used to demonstrate relationships between MR-parameters and type of sclerosis. In comparison to no-HS specimens, the PCL was significantly narrower in HS type 1 and HS type 2 hippocampi. This narrowing affected the entire cornu ammonis sector (CA) 1 in HS type 1, while it was limited to the upper half of CA1 in direction to CA2 in HS type 2. The parameter product median increased from 0.43 to 1.67 and 2.91 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for HS type 1, HS type 2 and no-HS, respectively. Correlation coefficients were significant for the PCL parameters product (0.73), area (0.71), T2*-time (-0.67), FA (0.65) and ADC (0.55). Our initial results suggest that HS type 1, HS type 2 and no-HS subtypes can be distinguished from each other using ex vivo UHF MRI based on T2-weighted morphologic images and the assessment of the parameter product. Upon clinical translation, UHF-MRI may provide a promising technique for the preoperative differentiation of HS subtypes in patients.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe35:34f43e70</id><title>Ultra-high field MRI of human hippocampi: Morphological and multiparametric differentiation of hippocampal sclerosis subtypes</title><fingerprint>14c9f5b3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Clarissa Gillmann, Roland Coras, Karl Rössler, Arnd Doerfler, Michael Uder, Ingmar Blümcke, Tobias Bäuerle&lt;/p&gt;

To examine effects of scan duration on estimates of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS), we reanalyzed data from thirty-nine previously reported L-[1-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]leucine PET studies. Subjects consisted of 12 healthy volunteers studied twice, awake and under propofol sedation, and 15 subjects with fragile X syndrome (FXS) studied once under propofol sedation. All scans were acquired on a high resolution scanner. We used a basis function method for voxelwise estimation of parameters of the kinetic model of L-[1-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]leucine and rCPS over the interval beginning at the time of tracer injection and ending 30, 45, 60, 75 or 90 min later. For each study and scan interval, regional estimates in nine regions and whole brain were obtained by averaging voxelwise estimates over all voxels in the region. In all three groups rCPS was only slightly affected by scan interval length and was very stable between 60 and 90 min. Furthermore, statistical comparisons of rCPS between awake and sedated healthy volunteers provided almost identical results when they were based on 60 min scan data as when they were based on data from the full 90 min interval. Statistical comparisons between sedated healthy volunteers and sedated subjects with FXS also yielded almost identical results when based on 60 and 90 min scan intervals. We conclude that, under the conditions of our studies, scan duration can be shortened to 60 min without loss of precision.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ad9:9f3b30f2</id><title>Effects of shortened scanning intervals on calculated regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis determined with the L-[1-&amp;lt;sup&gt;11&amp;lt;/sup&gt;C]leucine PET method</title><fingerprint>89206578</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Giampaolo Tomasi, Mattia Veronese, Alessandra Bertoldo, Carolyn Beebe Smith, Kathleen C.

To examine effects of scan duration on estimates of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS), we reanalyzed data from thirty-nine previously reported L-[1-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]leucine PET studies. Subjects consisted of 12 healthy volunteers studied twice, awake and under propofol sedation, and 15 subjects with fragile X syndrome (FXS) studied once under propofol sedation.

The large body of work demonstrating hyperthermic impairment of neuromuscular function has utilized maximal isometric contractions, but extrapolating these findings to whole-body exercise and submaximal, dynamic contractions may be problematic. We isolated and compared core and skin temperature influences on an isometric force task versus a position task requiring dynamic maintenance of joint angle. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured on the flexor carpi radialis at 60% of baseline maximal voluntary contraction while either pushing against a rigid restraint (force task) or while maintaining a constant wrist angle and supporting an equivalent inertial load (position task). Twenty participants performed each task at 0.5°C rectal temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;) intervals while being passively heated from 37.1±0.3°C to ≥1.5°C T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; and then cooled to 37.8±0.3°C, permitting separate analyses of core versus skin temperature influences. During a 3-s contraction, trend analysis revealed a quadratic trend that peaked during hyperthermia for root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude during the force task. In contrast, RMS amplitude during the position task remained stable with passive heating, then rapidly increased with the initial decrease in skin temperature at the onset of passive cooling (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010). Combined hot core and hot skin elicited shifts toward higher frequencies in the sEMG signal during the force task (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), whereas inconsistent changes in the frequency spectra occurred for the position task. Based on the patterns of RMS amplitude in response to thermal stress, we conclude that core temperature was the primary thermal afferent influencing neuromuscular response during a submaximal force task, with minimal input from skin temperature. However, skin temperature was the primary thermal afferent during a position task with minimal core temperature influence. Therefore, temperature has a task-dependent impact on neuromuscular responses.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde29:9f3b30f2</id><title>Core and skin temperature influences on the surface electromyographic responses to an isometric force and position task</title><fingerprint>8544f1bc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nico A.

We applied an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; selection approach using two different plant lectins that bind to α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialic acids to determine which genetic changes of the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus alter hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding toward α2,3- or α2,6-linked glycans. Consecutive passages of the A/California/04/09 virus with or without lectins in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells led to development of three HA1 amino acid substitutions, N129D, G155E, and S183P, and one mutation in the neuraminidase (NA), G201E. The S183P mutation significantly increased binding to several α2,6 SA-linked glycans, including YDS, 6′SL(N), and 6-Su-6′SLN, compared to the wild-type virus (↑3.6-fold, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Two other HA1 mutations, N129D and G155E, were sufficient to significantly increase binding to α2,6-linked glycans, 6′SLN and 6-Su-6′SLN, compared to S183P (↑4.1-fold, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). These HA1 mutations also increased binding affinity for 3′SLN glycan compared to the wild-type virus as measured by Biacore surface plasmon resonance method. In addition, the HA1 N129D and HA1 G155E substitutions were identified as antigenic mutations. Furthermore, the G201E mutation in NA reduced the NA enzyme activity (↓2.3-fold). These findings demonstrate that the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus can acquire enhanced receptor affinity for both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic receptors under lectin-induced selective pressure. Such changes in binding affinity are conferred by selection of beneficial HA1 mutations that affect receptor specificity, antigenicity, and/or functional compatibility with the NA protein.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715294:9aea0a7d</id><title>The use of plant lectins to regulate H1N1 influenza A virus receptor binding activity</title><fingerprint>4588b250</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicolette Lee, Alexey M.

Such changes in binding affinity are conferred by selection of beneficial HA1 mutations that affect receptor specificity, antigenicity, and/or functional compatibility with the NA protein.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196357</link><updated>1524517200000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196357</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Takeshi Ito</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196357</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196357</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1524517200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takeshi Ito, Sarahmi Ishida, Yohsuke Takahashi&lt;/p&gt;
Tobacco (&lt;i&gt;Nicotiana tabacum&lt;/i&gt;) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent protein kinase 1 (NtCDPK1) is involved in feedback regulation of the plant hormone gibberellin through the phosphorylation of the transcription factor, REPRESSION OF SHOOT GROWTH (RSG). Previously, Ser-6 and Thr-21 were identified as autophosphorylation sites in NtCDPK1. Autophosphorylation of Ser-6 and Thr-21 not only decreases the binding affinity of NtCDPK1 for RSG, but also inhibits the homodimerization of NtCDPK1. Furthermore, autophosphorylation decreases the phosphorylation efficiency of RSG. We demonstrated that Ser-6 and Thr-21 of NtCDPK1 are phosphorylated in response to GAs in plants. The substitution of these autophosphorylation sites with Ala enhances the NtCDPK1 overexpression-induced sensitization of seeds to a GA biosynthetic inhibitor during germination. These findings suggested that autophosphorylation of Ser-6 and Thr-21 prevents excessive phosphorylation of RSG. In this study, we attempted to determine which autophosphorylation site is responsible for the functional regulation of NtCDPK1. Ser-6 was autophosphorylated within 1 min, whereas Thr-21 required over 5 min to be completely autophosphorylated. Furthermore, we found that Ser-6 and Thr-21 were autophosphorylated by inter- and intramolecular mechanisms, respectively, which may be reflected in the faster autophosphorylation of Ser-6. Although both autophosphorylation sites were involved in the reduction of the binding affinity of NtCDPK1 for RSG and the inhibition of NtCDPK1 homodimerization, autophosphorylation of Ser-6 alone was sufficient to decrease the kinase activity of NtCDPK1 for RSG. These results suggest that autophosphorylation of Ser-6 is important for the rapid reduction of NtCDPK1 kinase activity for RSG, whereas that of Thr-21 may play an auxiliary role.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba7:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Autophosphorylation of Ser-6 via an intermolecular mechanism is important for the rapid reduction of NtCDPK1 kinase activity for substrate RSG</title><fingerprint>55182d9d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takeshi Ito, Sarahmi Ishida, Yohsuke Takahashi&lt;/p&gt;

Proneural genes are among the most early-acting genes in nervous system development, instructing blast cells to commit to a neuronal fate. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Atonal and Achaete-Scute complex (AS-C) genes, as well as their vertebrate orthologs, are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with such proneural activity. We show here that a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; AS-C homolog, &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt;, functions in a fundamentally different manner. In the embryonic, larval, and adult nervous systems, &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is expressed exclusively in a single nociceptive neuron class, ADL, and its expression in ADL is maintained via transcriptional autoregulation throughout the life of the animal. However, in &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; null mutants, the ADL neuron is generated and still appears neuronal in overall morphology and expression of panneuronal and pansensory features. Rather than acting as a proneural gene, we find that &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is required for the ADL neuron to function properly, to adopt its correct morphology, to express its unusually large repertoire of olfactory receptor–encoding genes, and to express other known features of terminal ADL identity, including neurotransmitter phenotype, neuropeptides, ion channels, and electrical synapse proteins. &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is sufficient to induce ADL identity features upon ectopic expression in other neuron types. The expression of ADL terminal identity features is directly controlled by HLH-4 via a phylogenetically conserved E-box motif, which, through bioinformatic analysis, we find to constitute a predictive feature of ADL-expressed terminal identity markers. The lineage that produces the ADL neuron was previously shown to require the conventional, transient proneural activity of another AS-C homolog, &lt;i&gt;hlh-14&lt;/i&gt;, demonstrating sequential activities of distinct AS-C-type bHLH genes in neuronal specification. Taken together, we have defined here an unconventional function of an AS-C-type bHLH gene as a terminal selector of neuronal identity and we speculate that such function could be reflective of an ancestral function of an “ur-” bHLH gene.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kaDsHczXIbg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162df0925ef:4f0a0:a077e55f</id><title>Unconventional function of an Achaete-Scute homolog as a terminal selector of nociceptive neuron identity</title><fingerprint>f17d1f60</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Neda Masoudi, Saeed Tavazoie, Lori Glenwinkel, Leesun Ryu, Kyuhyung Kim, Oliver Hobert&lt;/p&gt;
Proneural genes are among the most early-acting genes in nervous system development, instructing blast cells to commit to a neuronal fate. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Atonal and Achaete-Scute complex (AS-C) genes, as well as their vertebrate orthologs, are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with such proneural activity. We show here that a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; AS-C homolog, &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt;, functions in a fundamentally different manner. In the embryonic, larval, and adult nervous systems, &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is expressed exclusively in a single nociceptive neuron class, ADL, and its expression in ADL is maintained via transcriptional autoregulation throughout the life of the animal. However, in &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; null mutants, the ADL neuron is generated and still appears neuronal in overall morphology and expression of panneuronal and pansensory features. Rather than acting as a proneural gene, we find that &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is required for the ADL neuron to function properly, to adopt its correct morphology, to express its unusually large repertoire of olfactory receptor–encoding genes, and to express other known features of terminal ADL identity, including neurotransmitter phenotype, neuropeptides, ion channels, and electrical synapse proteins. &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is sufficient to induce ADL identity features upon ectopic expression in other neuron types.

Mounting evidence suggests that glycans, rather than merely serving as a “shield”, contribute critically to antigenicity of the HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein, representing critical antigenic determinants for many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). While many studies have focused on defining the role of individual glycans or groups of proximal glycans in bNAb binding, little is known about the effects of changes in the overall glycan landscape in modulating antibody access and Env antigenicity. Here we developed a systems glycobiology approach to reverse engineer the complexity of HIV glycan heterogeneity to guide antigenicity-based &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; glycoprotein design. bNAb binding was assessed against a panel of 94 recombinant gp120 monomers exhibiting defined glycan site occupancies. Using a Bayesian machine learning algorithm, bNAb-specific glycan footprints were identified and used to design antigens that selectively alter bNAb antigenicity as a proof-of concept. Our approach provides a new design strategy to predictively modulate antigenicity via the alteration of glycan topography, thereby focusing the humoral immune response on sites of viral vulnerability for HIV.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XbpST9Ne8uU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162e4229578:4d4f96:76251cdd</id><title>Exploiting glycan topography for computational design of Env glycoprotein antigenicity</title><fingerprint>5d7096dc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Han Yu, Peng Zhao, Monia Draghi, Claudia Arevalo, Christina B.

We previously demonstrated that transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 5 (TRPV5) expression was decreased in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) compared with that in normal kidney tissues, a finding that was correlated with vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression, but further investigations is warranted. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether VDR could regulate the expression of TRPV5 and affect proliferation and metastasis in RCC. In this study, we used lentivirus to conduct the model of VDR overexpression and knockdown caki-1 and 786-O RCC cell lines &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The results demonstrated that VDR overexpression significantly inhibited RCC cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis by the MTT, transwell cell migration/invasion and flow cytometry assays, respectively. However, VDR knockdown in RCC cells had the opposite effect. The RNA-sequence assay, which was assessed in caki-1 cells after VDR overexpression and knockdown, also indicated that significantly differentially expressed genes were associated with cell apoptotic, differentiation, proliferation and migration. RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that VDR knockdown increased TRPV5 expression and VDR overexpression decreased TRPV5 expression in caki-1 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of TRPV5 expression suppressed the VDR knockdown-induced change in the proliferation, migration and invasion in caki-1 cells. Taken together, these findings confirmed that VDR functions as a tumour suppressor in RCC cells and suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of RCC through regulating the expression of TRPV5.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae6:9f3b30f2</id><title>Vitamin D receptor suppresses proliferation and metastasis in renal cell carcinoma cell lines via regulating the expression of the epithelial Ca&amp;lt;sup&gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&gt; channel TRPV5</title><fingerprint>21cb99ee</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by YongMing Chen, XinYu Liu, FaBiao Zhang, ShanFan Liao, XiYuan He, DeXiang Zhuo, HuaiBin Huang, YongYang Wu&lt;/p&gt;

We collected soil and plant samples after rice harvest from a free-air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment (FACE) system, which had already run for more than 15 years. Our results show that eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased PAH concentrations in the soil, and we link this effect to a shift in soil microbial community structure and function.

Hyperopia is a common refractive error, apparent in 25% of Europeans. Treatments include spectacles, contact lenses, laser interventions and surgery including implantable contact lenses and lens extraction. Laser treatment offers an expedient and reliable means of correcting ametropia. LASIK is well-established however SMILE (small-incision lenticule extraction) or lenticule implantation (derived from myopic laser-correction) are newer options. In this study we compared the outcomes of hyperopic LASIK, SMILE and lenticule re-implantation in a primate model at +2D/+4D treatment. While re-implantation showed the greatest regression, broadly comparable refractive results were seen at 3-months with SMILE and LASIK (&amp;lt;1.4D of intended), but a greater tendency to regression in +2D lenticule reimplantation. Central corneal thickness showed greater variation at +2D treatment, but central thickening during lenticule reimplantation at +4D treatment was seen (-17± 27μm LASIK, -45 ± 18μm SMILE and 28 ± 17μm Re-implantation; p &amp;lt;0.01) with expected paracentral thinning following SMILE. Although in vivo confocal microscopy appeared to show higher reflectivity in all +4D treatment groups, there were minimal and inconsistent changes in inflammatory responses between modalities. SMILE and lenticule re-implantation may represent a safe and viable method for treating hyperopia, but further optimization for lower hyperopic treatments is warranted.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2815:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Hyperopic refractive correction by LASIK, SMILE or lenticule reimplantation in a non-human primate model</title><fingerprint>11fd5c8c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Geraint P.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Increasing use of factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors necessitates effective reversal agents to manage bleeding. Andexanet alfa, a novel modified recombinant human FXa, rapidly reverses the anticoagulation effects of direct and indirect FXa inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the ability of andexanet to reverse anticoagulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and reduce bleeding in rabbits administered edoxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies characterized the interaction of andexanet with edoxaban and its ability to reverse edoxaban-mediated anti-FXa activity. In a rabbit model of surgically induced, acute hemorrhage, animals received edoxaban vehicle+andexanet vehicle (control), edoxaban (1 mg/kg)+andexanet vehicle, edoxaban+andexanet (75 mg, 5-minute infusion, 20 minutes after edoxaban), or edoxaban vehicle+andexanet prior to injury.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Andexanet bound edoxaban with high affinity similar to FXa. Andexanet rapidly and dose-dependently reversed the effects of edoxaban on FXa activity and coagulation pharmacodynamic parameters &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In edoxaban-anticoagulated rabbits, andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity by 82% (from 548±87 to 100±41 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), mean unbound edoxaban plasma concentration by ~80% (from 100±10 to 21±6 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), and blood loss by 80% vs. vehicle (adjusted for control, 2.6 vs. 12.9 g; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). The reduction in blood loss correlated with the decrease in anti-FXa activity (r = 0.6993, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and unbound edoxaban (r = 0.5951, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0035).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that andexanet rapidly reversed the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban, suggesting it could be clinically valuable for the management of acute and surgery-related bleeding.

Radiation-induced lung damage is an important treatment-related toxicity after lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). After implementing a tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co magnetic-resonance image guided system, ViewRay&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, we compared the associated early radiological lung density changes to those associated with a linear accelerator (LINAC). Eight patients treated with the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system were matched 1:1 with patients treated with LINAC. Prescription doses were 52 Gy or 60 Gy in four fractions, and lung dose-volumetric parameters were calculated from each planning system. The first two follow-up computed tomography (CT) were co-registered with the planning CT through deformable registration software, and lung density was measured by isodose levels. Tumor size was matched between the two groups, but the planning target volume of LINAC was larger than that of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036). With regard to clinically relevant dose-volumetric parameters in the lungs, the ipsilateral lung mean dose, &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10Gy&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;20Gy&lt;/sub&gt; were significantly poorer in tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co plans compared to LINAC plans (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, 0.036, and 0.017, respectively). Increased lung density was not observed in the first follow-up scan compared to the planning scan. A significant change of lung density was shown in the second follow-up scan and there was no meaningful difference between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for all dose regions. In addition, no patient developed clinical radiation pneumonitis until the second follow-up scan. Therefore, there was no significant difference in the early radiological lung damage between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for lung SABR despite of the inferior plan quality of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system compared to that of LINAC. Further studies with a longer follow-up period are needed to confirm our findings.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7692b:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Lung density change after SABR: A comparative study between tri-Co-60 magnetic resonance-guided system and linear accelerator</title><fingerprint>2c2eb639</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eunji Kim, Hong-Gyun Wu, Jong Min Park, Jung-in Kim, Hak Jae Kim, Hyun-Cheol Kang&lt;/p&gt;

Tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy are a diverse group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders pathologically defined by inclusions containing aberrantly aggregated, post-translationally modified tau. The tau pathology burden correlates with neurodegeneration and dementia observed in these diseases. The microtubule binding domain of tau is essential for its physiological functions in promoting neuronal cytoskeletal stability, however it is also required for tau to assemble into an amyloid structure that comprises pathological inclusions. A series of novel monoclonal antibodies were generated which recognize the second and fourth microtubule-binding repeat domain of tau, thus enabling the identification specifically of 4-repeat tau versus 3-/4-repeat tau, respectively. These antibodies are highly specific for tau and recognize pathological tau inclusions in human tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and in transgenic mouse models of tauopathies. These new antibodies will be useful for identifying and characterizing different tauopathies and as tools to target tau pathology in these diseases.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7692d:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Novel monoclonal antibodies targeting the microtubule-binding domain of human tau</title><fingerprint>31701846</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cara L.

Many patients previously using darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) (800/100mg) have switched to darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/C) (800/150 mg) either as part of triple therapy (ART) or as monotherapy with DRV (mDRV). The latter approach continues to be used in some countries for patients receiving long-term treatment. However, to date, the behaviour of DRV/C in the seminal compartment has not been analysed. This study explores how the combination behaves in monotherapy, with respect to the control of viral load and seminal quality. To this end, we studied 20 patients who were treated with mDRV/C after previous treatment with mDRV/r for at least 24 weeks. A viral load control in seminal plasma similar to that published in the literature was observed after 24 weeks of treatment with mDRV/C (viral load positivity in 20% of patients). Similarly, semen quality was confirmed (70% normozoospermic) in patients treated with this formulation, as has previously been reported for ART and mDRV/r. The DRV levels measured in seminal plasma were above EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, regardless of whether the seminal viral load was positive or negative. We conclude that this mDRV/C co-formulation behaves like mDRV/r in seminal plasma in terms of viral load control and semen quality.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa4:34f43e70</id><title>Effect of monotherapy with darunavir/cobicistat on viral load and semen quality of HIV-1 patients</title><fingerprint>edc7ab8f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Miguel A.

Many patients previously using darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) (800/100mg) have switched to darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/C) (800/150 mg) either as part of triple therapy (ART) or as monotherapy with DRV (mDRV). The latter approach continues to be used in some countries for patients receiving long-term treatment. However, to date, the behaviour of DRV/C in the seminal compartment has not been analysed. This study explores how the combination behaves in monotherapy, with respect to the control of viral load and seminal quality. To this end, we studied 20 patients who were treated with mDRV/C after previous treatment with mDRV/r for at least 24 weeks. A viral load control in seminal plasma similar to that published in the literature was observed after 24 weeks of treatment with mDRV/C (viral load positivity in 20% of patients). Similarly, semen quality was confirmed (70% normozoospermic) in patients treated with this formulation, as has previously been reported for ART and mDRV/r. The DRV levels measured in seminal plasma were above EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, regardless of whether the seminal viral load was positive or negative. We conclude that this mDRV/C co-formulation behaves like mDRV/r in seminal plasma in terms of viral load control and semen quality.</description></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293431v1?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293431v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293431v1?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/02/293431</canonicalUrl><author><name>Caicedo, J.

Background &lt;p&gt;The use of iodine-based contrast agents entails the risk of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Radiocontrast agents elicit the third most common cause of nephropathy among hospitalized patients, accounting for 11–12% of cases. CIN is connected with clinically significant consequences, including increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, increased risk of complications, potential need for dialysis, and increased mortality rate. The number of in-hospital examinations using iodine-based contrast media has been significantly increasing over the last decade. In order to protect patients from possible complications of such examinations, new biomarkers are needed that are able to predict a risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Urinary and plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations are influenced by renal function. Urinary cGMP is primarily of renal cellular origin. Therefore, we assessed if urinary cGMP concentration may predict major adverse renal events (MARE) after contrast media exposure during coronary angiography.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Urine samples were prospectively collected from non-randomized consecutive patients with either diabetes or preexisting impaired kidney function receiving intra-arterial contrast medium (CM) for emergent or elective coronary angiography at the Charité Campus Mitte, University Hospital Berlin. Urinary cGMP concentration in spot urine was analyzed 24 hours after CM exposure. Patients were followed up over 90 days for occurrence of death, initiation of dialysis, doubling of plasma creatinine concentration or MARE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 289 consecutive patients were included into the study. Urine cGMP/creatinine ratio 24 hours before CM exposure expressed as mean±SD was predictive for the need of dialysis (no dialysis: 89.77±92.85 μM/mM, n = 277; need for dialysis: 140.3±82.90 μM/mM, n = 12, p = 0.008), death (no death during follow-up: 90.60±92.50 μM/mM, n = 280; death during follow-up: 169.88±81.52 μM/mM, n = 9; p = 0.002), and the composite endpoint MARE (no MARE: 86.02±93.17 μM/mM, n = 271; MARE: 146.64±74.68 μM/mM, n = 18, p&amp;lt;0.001) during the follow-up of 90 days after contrast media application. cGMP/creatinine ratio stayed significantly increased at values exceeding 120 μM/mM in patients who developed MARE, required dialysis or died.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Urinary cGMP/creatinine ratio ≥ 120 μM/mM before CM exposure is a promising biomarker for the need of dialysis and all-cause mortality 90 days after CM exposure in patients with preexisting renal impairment or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d0:9f3b30f2</id><title>Urinary cGMP predicts major adverse renal events in patients with mild renal impairment and/or diabetes mellitus before exposure to contrast medium</title><fingerprint>76cfb651</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lyubov Chaykovska, Fabian Heunisch, Gina von Einem, Carl-Friedrich Hocher, Oleg Tsuprykov, Mira Pavkovic, Peter Sandner, Axel Kretschmer, Chang Chu, Saban Elitok, Johannes-Peter Stasch, Berthold Hocher&lt;/p&gt;

In higher plants, ω-3 fatty acid desaturases are the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of alpha-linolenic acid (18:3), which plays key roles in plant metabolism as a structural component of both storage and membrane lipids. Here, the first ω-3 fatty acid desaturase gene was identified and characterized from oil palm. The bioinformatic analysis indicated it encodes a temperature-sensitive chloroplast ω-3 fatty acid desaturase, designated as &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt;. The expression analysis revealed that &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in the oil palm leaves, when compared with the expression in the mesocarp. The heterologous expression of &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; in yeast resulted in the production of a novel fatty acid 18:3 (about 0.27%), when fed with 18:2 in the induction culture. Furthermore, to detect whether &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; could be induced by the environment stress, we detected the expression efficiency of the &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis treated with low temperature and darkness, respectively. The results indicated that the promoter of &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; gene could be significantly induced by low temperature and slightly induced by darkness. These results reveal the function of EgFAD8 and the feature of its promoter from oil palm fruits, which will be useful for understanding the fuction and regulation of plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturases in higher plants.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae81:fc1f8953</id><title>Identification and characterization of a plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturase &amp;lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&amp;lt;/i&gt; from oil palm (&amp;lt;i&gt;Elaeis guineensis&amp;lt;/i&gt; Jacq.) and its promoter response to light and low temperature</title><fingerprint>764ff45b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lizhi Chen, Lei Wang, Herong Wang, Ruhao Sun, Lili You, Yusheng Zheng, Yijun Yuan, Dongdong Li&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Evidence remains limited on why diabetes and hypertensive patients admitted to long-term drug therapy miss doses or discontinue medication taking. We examined this phenomenon from the perspective of diabetes and hypertension patients at a Ghanaian teaching hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between July and December 2015, we conducted a qualitative study targeting caregivers and their patients with chronic diabetes and hypertensive on re-admission at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital due to non-adherence to prescribed medication.

Notes and audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, managed and coded for themes guided by the thematic network analysis recommended by Attride-Stirling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Non-adherence was the result of perceptions that the medications are not effective for managing the conditions. Patients with these perceptions rejected the medications and turned to herbal medicines and spiritual healing as therapeutic alternatives, because of their easy accessibility, perceived efficacy and affordability.

DNA methylation is mediated by a conserved family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). The human genome encodes three active Dnmts (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b), the tRNA methyltransferase Dnmt2, and the regulatory protein Dnmt3L. Despite their high degree of conservation among different species, genes encoding Dnmts have been duplicated and/or lost in multiple lineages throughout evolution, indicating that the DNA methylation machinery has some potential to undergo evolutionary change. However, little is known about the extent to which this machinery, or the methylome, varies among vertebrates. Here, we study the molecular evolution of Dnmt1, the enzyme responsible for maintenance of DNA methylation patterns after replication, in 79 vertebrate species. Our analyses show that all studied species exhibit a single copy of the &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; gene, with the exception of tilapia and marsupials (tammar wallaby, koala, Tasmanian devil and opossum), each of which displays two apparently functional &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; duplicated before the radiation of major marsupial groups (i.e., at least ~75 million years ago), thus giving rise to two &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies in marsupials (copy 1 and copy 2). In the opossum lineage, copy 2 was lost, and copy 1 recently duplicated again, generating three &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies: two putatively functional genes (copy 1a and 1b) and one pseudogene (copy 1ψ). Both marsupial copies (&lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies 1 and 2) are under purifying selection, and copy 2 exhibits elevated rates of evolution and signatures of positive selection, suggesting a scenario of neofunctionalization. This gene duplication might have resulted in modifications in marsupial methylomes and their dynamics.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f45fe:34f43e70</id><title>Molecular evolution of &amp;lt;i&gt;DNMT1&amp;lt;/i&gt; in vertebrates: Duplications in marsupials followed by positive selection</title><fingerprint>22f41d4c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Alvarez-Ponce, María Torres-Sánchez, Felix Feyertag, Asmita Kulkarni, Taylen Nappi&lt;/p&gt;

Although personality traits can largely affect individual fitness we know little about the evolutionary forces generating and maintaining personality variation. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that personality variation in aggression is sexually selected in the monogamous, bi-parental cichlid &lt;i&gt;Pelvicachromis pulcher&lt;/i&gt;. In this species, breeding pairs form territories and they aggressively defend their territory and offspring against con- and heterospecific intruders. In our mate choice study, we followed up two alternative hypotheses. We either expected females to show a directional preference for a high level and high consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for male parental quality). Alternatively, we expected females to choose males for (dis-)similarity in the level/consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for compatibility). Individual level and consistency of aggression were assessed for males and females using mirror tests. After eavesdropping on aggressive behaviour of two males (differing in level and consistency of aggression) females were then allowed to choose between the two males. Males, but not females, showed personality variation in aggression. Further, females generally preferred consistent over inconsistent males independent of their level of aggression. We did not detect a general preference for the level of male aggression. However, we found an above average preference for consistent high-aggression males; whereas female preference for inconsistent high-aggression did not deviate from random choice. Our results suggest behavioural consistency of aggression in male rainbow kribs is selected for via female mate choice. Further, our study underlines the importance of considering both the level and the consistency of a behavioural trait in studies of animal behaviour.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c6:9aea0a7d</id><title>Predictability is attractive: Female preference for behaviourally consistent males but no preference for the level of male aggression in a bi-parental cichlid</title><fingerprint>9fb58851</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ulrike Scherer, Mira Kuhnhardt, Wiebke Schuett&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite decades of efforts to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) in the United States (US), TB still contributes to adverse ill health, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2016, about 87% of the TB cases reported in the US were among racial and ethnic minorities. The objective of this study is to explore the risks for pregnancy complications and in-hospital death among mothers diagnosed with TB across racial/ethnic groups in the US.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized National Inpatient Sample data for all inpatient hospital discharges in the US. We analyzed pregnancy-related hospitalizations and births in the US from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2014 (n = 57,393,459). Multivariable logistic regression was applied to generate odds ratios for the association between TB status and the primary study outcomes (i.e., pregnancy complications and in-hospital death) across racial/ethnic categories.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of TB was 7.1 per 100,000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations. The overall prevalence of pregnancy complications was 80% greater among TB-infected mothers than their uninfected counterparts. Severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, placenta previa, post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis and anemia occurred with greater frequency among mothers with a TB diagnosis than those without TB, irrespective of race/ethnicity. The rate of in-hospital death among TB patients was 37 times greater among TB-infected than in non-TB infected mothers (468.8 per 100,000 versus 12.6 per 100,000). A 3-fold increased risk of in-hospital death was observed among black TB-negative mothers compared to their white counterparts. No racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity or in-hospital death were found among mothers with TB disease.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;TB continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women in the US. Resources to address TB disease should also target pregnant women, especially racial/ethnic minorities who bear the greatest burden of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf600:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Tuberculosis during pregnancy in the United States: Racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy complications and in-hospital death</title><fingerprint>40657a59</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erika M.

Background &lt;p&gt;MRI is the optimal method for sensitive detection of tumour tissue and pre-operative staging in oral cancer. When jawbone resections are necessary, the current standard of care for oral tumour surgery in our hospital is 3D virtual planning from CT data. 3D printed jawbone cutting guides are designed from the CT data. The tumour margins are difficult to visualise on CT, whereas they are clearly visible on MRI scans. The aim of this study was to change the conventional CT-based workflow by developing a method for 3D MRI-based lower jaw models. The MRI-based visualisation of the tumour aids in planning bone resection margins.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and findings &lt;p&gt;A workflow for MRI-based 3D surgical planning with bone cutting guides was developed using a four-step approach. Key MRI parameters were defined (phase 1), followed by an application of selected Black Bone MRI sequences on healthy volunteers (phase 2). Three Black Bone MRI sequences were chosen for phase 3: standard, fat saturated, and an out of phase sequence. These protocols were validated by applying them on patients (n = 10) and comparison to corresponding CT data. The mean deviation values between the MRI- and the CT-based models were 0.63, 0.59 and 0.80 mm for the three evaluated Black Bone MRI sequences. Phase 4 entailed examination of the clinical value during surgery, using excellently fitting printed bone cutting guides designed from MRI-based lower jaw models, in two patients with oral cancer. The mean deviation of the resection planes was 2.3 mm, 3.8 mm for the fibula segments, and the mean axis deviation was the fibula segments of 1.9°.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study offers a method for 3D virtual resection planning and surgery using cutting guides based solely on MRI imaging. Therefore, no additional CT data are required for 3D virtual planning in oral cancer surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e800:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Optimisation of three-dimensional lower jaw resection margin planning using a novel Black Bone magnetic resonance imaging protocol</title><fingerprint>d8f94fdc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Astrid M.

Therefore, no additional CT data are required for 3D virtual planning in oral cancer surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195779</link><updated>1523480400000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195779</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Kana Masuda</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195779</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195779</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1523480400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kana Masuda, Katsuyuki Tanabe, Haruyo Ujike, Norikazu Hinamoto, Hiromasa Miyake, Satoshi Tanimura, Hitoshi Sugiyama, Yasufumi Sato, Yohei Maeshima, Jun Wada&lt;/p&gt;
Angiogenesis has been implicated in glomerular alterations in the early stage of diabetic nephropathy. We previously reported the renoprotective effects of vasohibin-1 (VASH1), which is a novel angiogenesis inhibitor derived from endothelial cells, on diabetic nephropathy progression. Vasohibin-2 (VASH2) was originally identified as a VASH1 homolog and possesses pro-angiogenic activity in contrast to VASH1. In addition, VASH2 was recently shown to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via enhanced transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling in cancer cells. Herein, we investigated the pathogenic roles of VASH2 in diabetic nephropathy using VAHS2-deficient mice. The type 1 diabetes model was induced by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin in VASH2 homozygous knockout (VASH2&lt;sup&gt;LacZ/LacZ&lt;/sup&gt;) or wild-type mice. These mice were euthanized 16 weeks after inducing hyperglycemia. Increased urine albumin excretion and creatinine clearance observed in diabetic wild-type mice were significantly prevented in diabetic VASH2-deficient mice. Accordingly, diabetes-induced increase in glomerular volume and reduction in glomerular slit-diaphragm density were significantly improved in VASH2 knockout mice. Increased glomerular endothelial area was also suppressed in VASH2-deficient mice, in association with inhibition of enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2), but not VEGF level. Furthermore, glomerular accumulation of mesangial matrix, including type IV collagen, and increased expression of TGF-β were improved in diabetic VASH2 knockout mice compared with diabetic wild-type mice. Based on the immunofluorescence findings, endogenous VASH2 localization in glomeruli was consistent with mesangial cells. Human mesangial cells (HMCs) were cultured under high glucose condition in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments. Transfection of VASH2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) into the HMCs resulted in the suppression of type IV collagen production induced by high glucose compared with control siRNA. These results indicate that VASH2 may be involved in diabetes-induced glomerular alterations, particularly impaired filtration barrier and mesangial expansion. Therefore, VASH2 is likely to represent a promising therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d4:34f43e70</id><title>Deletion of pro-angiogenic factor vasohibin-2 ameliorates glomerular alterations in a mouse diabetic nephropathy model</title><fingerprint>8c50a8de</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kana Masuda, Katsuyuki Tanabe, Haruyo Ujike, Norikazu Hinamoto, Hiromasa Miyake, Satoshi Tanimura, Hitoshi Sugiyama, Yasufumi Sato, Yohei Maeshima, Jun Wada&lt;/p&gt;

Increased production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their widespread application in industrial and consumer products have led to a rise in the release of CNTs into the aquatic environment. CNTs have a very strong adsorption affinity for various environmental contaminants; therefore, they may also influence the toxic effects of other pollutants, such as toxic metals. In this study, the effect of two different functionalized carbon nanotubes, carboxylate and polyethyleneimine modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (C-MWCNTs and N-MWCNT, respectively) on lead toxicity and bioaccumulation was investigated with a freshwater zooplankton &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt;. The acute toxicity results indicate that the different surface properties of the two types of MWCNTs have different effects on lead toxicity to &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;magna&lt;/i&gt;. The negatively charged C-MWCNT showed a notable decrease in lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.08 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; C-MWCNT), whereas the positively charged N-MWCNT had only a slight effect on lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 0.16 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; N-MWCNT). The decrease of lead toxicity was related with the reduced bioavailability of free metal form (Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) caused by greater adsorption of lead onto the MWCNTs. The present study suggests that there is a need to consider carefully the complex interaction of CNTs with toxic metals in future ecotoxicological studies.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0c:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Effects of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes on toxicity and bioaccumulation of lead in &amp;lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>d544b27b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Min-Hee Jang, Yu Sik Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

Human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (A3) proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases that catalyze the conversion of deoxycytidine (dC) to deoxyuridine (dU) in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis—for example, A3G deaminates the third dC in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy using the protection of telomeres protein 1 (Pot1) which has nanomolar affinity for ssDNA, with which we captured an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We crystallized a non-preferred adenine in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket of A3G. The structure reveals a unique conformation of the catalytic site loops that sheds light onto how the enzyme scans substrate in the -1 pocket.

Human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (A3) proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases that catalyze the conversion of deoxycytidine (dC) to deoxyuridine (dU) in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis—for example, A3G deaminates the third dC in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy using the protection of telomeres protein 1 (Pot1) which has nanomolar affinity for ssDNA, with which we captured an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We crystallized a non-preferred adenine in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket of A3G. The structure reveals a unique conformation of the catalytic site loops that sheds light onto how the enzyme scans substrate in the -1 pocket. Furthermore, our biochemistry and virology studies provide evidence that the nucleotide-binding pockets on A3G influence each other in selecting the preferred DNA substrate. Together, the results provide insights into the mechanism by which A3G selects and deaminates its preferred substrates and help define how A3 proteins are tailored to recognize specific DNA sequences. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of DNA substrate selection by A3G, as well as A3G antiviral activity against HIV-1.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24034-6</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/xrWtbxJrcWo/s41598-018-24034-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24034-6</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Maxime Barbier</name></author><published>1523430000000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24034-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523438557096</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24034-6/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24034_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>609</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changing patterns of human migrations shaped the global population structure of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; in France&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing patterns of human migrations shaped the global population structure of &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&amp;lt;/i&gt; in France, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24034-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24034-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Changing patterns of human migrations shaped the global population structure of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; in France&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/xrWtbxJrcWo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b40397a8:43fd6a:34f43e70</id><title>Changing patterns of human migrations shaped the global population structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in France</title><fingerprint>42eed9b6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changing patterns of human migrations shaped the global population structure of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; in France&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing patterns of human migrations shaped the global population structure of &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&amp;lt;/i&gt; in France, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24034-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24034-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Changing patterns of human migrations shaped the global population structure of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; in France&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/xrWtbxJrcWo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.7b01104</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.7b01104/20180419/images/medium/cb-2017-011047_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.7b01104&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 dibetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is frequent and associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard to measure cardiac autonomic neuropathy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta–analysis to evaluate the impact of T2DM on HRV parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; October 2017 using the keywords “diabetes” AND (“heart rate variability” OR “HRV”). Included articles had to report HRV parameters in T2DM patients and healthy controls measured during 24 hours with a Holter–electrocardiogram. Measurements of HRV retieved were: RR–intervals (or Normal to Normal intervals—NN), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), percetange of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), total power, Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio, as per Task Force recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included twenty-five case-control studies with 2,932 patients: 1,356 with T2DM and 1,576 healthy controls. T2DM patients had significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) lower RR–intervals (effect size = –0.61; 95%CI –1.21 to –0.01), lower SDNN (–0.65; –0.83 to –0.47), lower RMSSD (–0.92; –1.37 to –0.47), lower pNN50 (–0.46; –0.84 to –0.09), lower total power (–1.52; –2.13 to –0.91), lower LF (–1.08; –1.46 to –0.69]), and lower HF (–0.79; –1.09 to –0.50). LF/HF did not differ between groups. Levels of blood glucose and HbA1c were associated with several HRV parameters, as well as Time from diagnosis of T2DM&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;T2DM was associated with an overall decrease in the HRV of T2DM patients.

A macromolecular complex of the enzymes involved in human &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; purine biosynthesis, the purinosome, has been shown to consist of a core assembly to regulate the metabolic activity of the pathway. However, it remains elusive whether the core assembly itself can be selectively controlled in the cytoplasm without promoting the purinosome. Here, we reveal that pharmacological inhibition of the cytoplasmic activity of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) selectively promotes the formation of the core assembly, but not the purinosome, in cancer cells. However, alternative signaling cascades that are associated with the plasma membrane-bound PDK1 activity, including Akt-mediated cascades, regulate neither the core assembly nor the purinosome in our conditions. Along with immunofluorescence microscopy and a knock-down study against PDK1 using small interfering RNAs, we reveal that cytoplasmic PDK1-associated signaling pathways regulate subcellular colocalization of three enzymes that form the core assembly of the purinosome in an Akt-independent manner.

Background &lt;p&gt;Yunnan has the greatest share of reported human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases in China. In recent years, HIV prevalence and incidence remained stubbornly high in men who have sex with men (MSM). To follow the dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic among MSM, HIV-1 genetic characteristics and genetic transmission networks were investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Blood samples from 190 newly diagnosed HIV-1 cases among MSM were continuously collected at fixed sites from January 2013 to December 2015 in Kunming City, Yunnan Province. Partial &lt;i&gt;gag&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;pol&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt; genes were sequenced and used for phylogenetic and genotypic drug resistance analyses. The genetic characteristics of the predominant HIV-1 strains were analyzed by the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The genetic transmission networks were identified with a genetic distance of 0.03 substitutions/site and 90% bootstrap support.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 190 HIV-1 positive MSM reported during 2013–2105, various genotypes were identified, including CRF01_AE (45.3%), CRF07_BC (35.8%), unique recombinant forms (URFs) (11.6%), CRF08_BC (3.2%), CRF55_01B (2.1%), subtype B (1.6%) and CRF59_01B (0.5%). The effective population sizes (EPS) for CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC increased exponentially from approximately 2001–2010 and 2005–2009, respectively. Genetic transmission networks were constructed with 308 &lt;i&gt;pol&lt;/i&gt; sequences from MSM diagnosed during 2010–2015. Of the 308 MSM, 109 (35.4%) were identified in 38 distinct clusters. Having multiple male partners was associated with a high probability of identification in the genetic transmission networks. Of the 38 clusters, 27 (71.1%) contained individuals diagnosed in different years. Of the 109 individuals in the networks, 26 (23.9%) had ≥2 potential transmission partners (≥2 links). The proportion of MSM with ≥2 links was higher among those diagnosed from 2010–2012. The constituent ratios of their potential transmission partners by areas showed no significant difference among MSM from Kunming, other cities in Yunnan and other provinces. Additionally, surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) were identified in 5% of individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study revealed the various HIV-a genotypes circulating among MSM in Kunming. MSM with more partners were more easily detected in transmission networks, and early-diagnosed MSM remained active in transmission networks. These findings suggested that the routine interventions should be combined with HIV testing and linkage to care and early antiretroviral therapy among HIV-positive MSM.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7a:fc1f8953</id><title>HIV-1 genetic transmission networks among men who have sex with men in Kunming, China</title><fingerprint>3870201e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Min Chen, Yanling Ma, Huichao Chen, Jie Dai, Lijuan Dong, Chaojun Yang, Youfang Li, Hongbing Luo, Renzhong Zhang, Xiaomei Jin, Li Yang, Allen Ka Loon Cheung, Manhong Jia, Zhizhong Song&lt;/p&gt;

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is state of the art in molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this context, maintenance of assay fidelity and detection of technical inaccuracy are crucial. Beside multiple common negative controls for the clinical sample preparations, quality control charts (QCC) are a common validation tool to sustain high process quality by continuously recording of qRT-PCR control parameters. Here, we report on establishment and benefit of QCC in qRT-PCR-based CML diagnostics. The absolute quantification of &lt;i&gt;BCR-ABL1&lt;/i&gt; fusion transcripts in patient samples is based on coamplification of a serially diluted reference plasmid (pME-2). For QCC establishment the measured Ct values of each pME-2 standard dilution (4–400,000) of a test set resembling 21 sequential qRT-PCR experiments were recorded and statistically evaluated. Test set data were used for determination of warning limits (mean +/- 2-fold standard deviation) and control (intervention) limits (mean +/- 3-fold standard deviation) to allow rapid detection of defined out-of-control situations which may require intervention. We have retrospectively analyzed QCC data of 282 sequential qRT-PCR experiments (564 reactions). Data evaluation using QCCs revealed three out-of-control situations that required intervention like experiment repeats, renewal of pME-2 standards, replacement of reagents or personnel re-training. In conclusion, with minimal more effort and hands-on time QCC rank among the best tools to grant high quality and reproducibility in CML routine molecular diagnosis.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fae:34f43e70</id><title>The benefit of quality control charts (QCC) for routine quantitative &amp;lt;i&gt;BCR-ABL1&amp;lt;/i&gt; monitoring in chronic myeloid leukemia</title><fingerprint>c365b4df</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Birgit Spiess, Nicole Naumann, Norbert Galuschek, Sébastien Rinaldetti, Ute Kossak-Roth, Irina Tarnopolscaia, Elena Felde, Alice Fabarius, Wolf-Karsten Hofmann, Susanne Saußele, Wolfgang Seifarth&lt;/p&gt;

The absolute quantification of &lt;i&gt;BCR-ABL1&lt;/i&gt; fusion transcripts in patient samples is based on coamplification of a serially diluted reference plasmid (pME-2). For QCC establishment the measured Ct values of each pME-2 standard dilution (4–400,000) of a test set resembling 21 sequential qRT-PCR experiments were recorded and statistically evaluated. Test set data were used for determination of warning limits (mean +/- 2-fold standard deviation) and control (intervention) limits (mean +/- 3-fold standard deviation) to allow rapid detection of defined out-of-control situations which may require intervention. We have retrospectively analyzed QCC data of 282 sequential qRT-PCR experiments (564 reactions). Data evaluation using QCCs revealed three out-of-control situations that required intervention like experiment repeats, renewal of pME-2 standards, replacement of reagents or personnel re-training. In conclusion, with minimal more effort and hands-on time QCC rank among the best tools to grant high quality and reproducibility in CML routine molecular diagnosis.</description></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019344?af=R</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019344?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019344?af=R</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Pedro Fonseca</name></author><published>1522907139000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b60:7c9981b6</id><title>Multi-scale coarse-graining for the study of assembly pathways in DNA-brick self-assembly</title><fingerprint>7a3ec1f4</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04156-7</link><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04156-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04156-7/d41586-018-04156-7_15603270.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04156-7</originId><published>1523430000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1523448816772</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suspected chemical attack, opioid-crisis cash and nuclear-fusion facility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspected chemical attack, opioid-crisis cash and nuclear-fusion facility, Published online: 11 April 2018;

Sea turtles are distributed in tropical and subtropical seas worldwide. They play several ecological roles and are considered important indicators of the health of marine ecosystems. Studying epibiotic diatoms living on turtle shells suggestively has great potential in the study of turtle behavior because diatoms are always there. However, diatom identification at the species level is time consuming, requires well-trained specialists, and there is a high probability of finding new taxa growing on turtle shells, which makes identification tricky. An alternative approach based on DNA barcoding and high throughput sequencing (HTS), metabarcoding, has been developed in recent years to identify species at the community level by using a DNA reference library. The suitabilities of morphological and molecular approaches were compared. Diatom assemblages were sampled from seven juvenile green turtles (&lt;i&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/i&gt;) from Mayotte Island, France. The structures of the epibiotic diatom assemblages differed between both approaches. This resulted in different clustering of the turtles based on their diatom communities. Metabarcoding allowed better discrimination between turtles based on their epibiotic diatom assemblages and put into evidence the presence of a cryptic diatom diversity. Microscopy, for its part, provided more ecological information of sea turtles based on historical bibliographical data and the abundances of ecological guilds of the diatom species present in the samples. This study shows the complementary nature of these two methods for studying turtle behavior.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7adf:9f3b30f2</id><title>DNA metabarcoding and microscopic analyses of sea turtles biofilms: Complementary to understand turtle behavior</title><fingerprint>5f2ddbf7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sinziana F.

Bdelloid rotifers are a class of microscopic invertebrates that have existed for millions of years apparently without sex or meiosis. They inhabit a variety of temporary and permanent freshwater habitats globally, and many species are remarkably tolerant of desiccation. Bdelloids offer an opportunity to better understand the evolution of sex and recombination, but previous work has emphasised desiccation as the cause of several unusual genomic features in this group. Here, we present high-quality whole-genome sequences of 3 bdelloid species: &lt;i&gt;Rotaria macrura&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;magnacalcarata&lt;/i&gt;, which are both desiccation intolerant, and &lt;i&gt;Adineta ricciae&lt;/i&gt;, which is desiccation tolerant. In combination with the published assembly of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vaga&lt;/i&gt;, which is also desiccation tolerant, we apply a comparative genomics approach to evaluate the potential effects of desiccation tolerance and asexuality on genome evolution in bdelloids. We find that ancestral tetraploidy is conserved among all 4 bdelloid species, but homologous divergence in obligately aquatic &lt;i&gt;Rotaria&lt;/i&gt; genomes is unexpectedly low. This finding is contrary to current models regarding the role of desiccation in shaping bdelloid genomes. In addition, we find that homologous regions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ricciae&lt;/i&gt; are largely collinear and do not form palindromic repeats as observed in the published &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vaga&lt;/i&gt; assembly. Consequently, several features interpreted as genomic evidence for long-term ameiotic evolution are not general to all bdelloid species, even within the same genus. Finally, we substantiate previous findings of high levels of horizontally transferred nonmetazoan genes in both desiccating and nondesiccating bdelloid species and show that this unusual feature is not shared by other animal phyla, even those with desiccation-tolerant representatives. These comparisons call into question the proposed role of desiccation in mediating horizontal genetic transfer.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/y70C1gFZUSk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f8c0d479:29c06a:ae8b474d</id><title>Comparative genomics of bdelloid rotifers: Insights from desiccating and nondesiccating species</title><fingerprint>8d6ff735</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Reuben W.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies are becoming routinely used for the detection of novel and clinically actionable DNA variants at a pangenomic scale. Such analyses are now used in the clinical practice to enable precision medicine. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are still one of the most abundant source of cancer clinical specimen, unfortunately this method of preparation is known to degrade DNA and therefore compromise subsequent analysis. Some studies have reported that variant detection can be performed on FFPE samples sequenced with NGS techniques, but few or none have done an in-depth coverage analysis and compared the influence of different state-of-the-art FFPE DNA extraction kits on the quality of the variant calling. Here, we generated 42 human whole-exome sequencing data sets from fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE samples. These samples include normal and tumor tissues from two different organs (liver and colon), that we extracted with three different FFPE extraction kits (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and GeneRead DNA FFPE kit from Qiagen, Maxwell&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; RSC DNA FFPE Kit from Promega). We determined the rate of concordance of called variants between matched FF and FFPE samples on all common variants (representing at least 86% of the total number of variants for SNVs). The concordance rate is very high between all matched FF / FFPE pairs, with equivalent values for the three kits we analyzed. On the other hand, when looking at the difference between the total number of variants in FF and FFPE, we find a significant variation for the three different FFPE DNA extraction kits. Coverage analysis shows that FFPE samples have less good indicators than FF samples, yet the coverage quality remains above accepted thresholds. We detect limited but statistically significant variations in coverage indicator values between the three FFPE extraction kits. Globally, the GeneRead and QIAamp kits have better variant calling and coverage indicators than the Maxwell kit on the samples used in this study, although this kit performs better on some indicators and has advantages in terms of practical usage. Taken together, our results confirm the potential of FFPE samples analysis for clinical genomic studies, but also indicate that the choice of a FFPE DNA extraction kit should be done with careful testing and analysis beforehand in order to maximize the accuracy of the results.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d736:9f3b30f2</id><title>Performance comparison of three DNA extraction kits on human whole-exome data from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal and tumor samples</title><fingerprint>d03d05e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Bonnet, Marie-Laure Moutet, Céline Baulard, Delphine Bacq-Daian, Florian Sandron, Lilia Mesrob, Bertrand Fin, Marc Delépine, Marie-Ange Palomares, Claire Jubin, Hélène Blanché, Vincent Meyer, Anne Boland, Robert Olaso, Jean-François Deleuze&lt;/p&gt;

These samples include normal and tumor tissues from two different organs (liver and colon), that we extracted with three different FFPE extraction kits (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and GeneRead DNA FFPE kit from Qiagen, Maxwell&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; RSC DNA FFPE Kit from Promega). We determined the rate of concordance of called variants between matched FF and FFPE samples on all common variants (representing at least 86% of the total number of variants for SNVs). The concordance rate is very high between all matched FF / FFPE pairs, with equivalent values for the three kits we analyzed. On the other hand, when looking at the difference between the total number of variants in FF and FFPE, we find a significant variation for the three different FFPE DNA extraction kits. Coverage analysis shows that FFPE samples have less good indicators than FF samples, yet the coverage quality remains above accepted thresholds. We detect limited but statistically significant variations in coverage indicator values between the three FFPE extraction kits. Globally, the GeneRead and QIAamp kits have better variant calling and coverage indicators than the Maxwell kit on the samples used in this study, although this kit performs better on some indicators and has advantages in terms of practical usage. Taken together, our results confirm the potential of FFPE samples analysis for clinical genomic studies, but also indicate that the choice of a FFPE DNA extraction kit should be done with careful testing and analysis beforehand in order to maximize the accuracy of the results.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23960-9</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/G2gcPym6w-o/s41598-018-23960-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23960-9</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Dong Yun Choi</name></author><published>1523343600000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23960-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523351821430</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23960-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23960-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/G2gcPym6w-o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162aed81c76:1bbfa82:9aea0a7d</id><title>Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties</title><fingerprint>95e1240</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23960-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23960-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/G2gcPym6w-o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304949v1?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304949v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304949v1?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/22/304949</canonicalUrl><author><name>Saad, M.

Cerium (Ce) belongs to the rare earth elements (REEs), and although it is not essential for plants, it can stimulate growth and other physiological processes. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of Ce on seed germination, initial seedling growth, and vegetative growth in rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) cv. Morelos A-98. During the germination process, the seeds were treated with Ce concentrations of 0, 4, 8, and 12 μM; after 5 d, germination percentage was recorded and after 10 d seedling growth was measured. For vegetative growth, a hydroponic system was established where 14-d-old plants without previous Ce treatment were transferred into nutrient solution. After two weeks of acclimatizing, 0, 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce were added to the nutrient solution for 28 d. Ce significantly increased germination and the initial growth variables of the seedlings. During vegetative growth, Ce increased plant height, number of tillers, root volume, and shoot fresh and dry biomass, without affecting root biomass weight. With low Ce concentrations (25 and 50 μM), the concentrations of chlorophylls and amino acids in the shoots were similar to those in the control, like amino acid concentration in the roots at a concentration of 25 μM Ce. Conversely, the concentration of total sugars increased in the shoot with the application of 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce, and in the roots with the application of 50 μM Ce. Also, Ce did not affect the concentration of macro or micronutrients in the shoots. However, in the roots, the high Ce concentration decreased the concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mn, and Zn, while the Mg concentration increased. Our results indicate that Ce, at the right concentrations, can function as a biostimulant in rice germination and growth.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f1:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Cerium enhances germination and shoot growth, and alters mineral nutrient concentration in rice</title><fingerprint>97c046b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Monzerrat Ramírez-Olvera, Libia Iris Trejo-Téllez, Soledad García-Morales, Juan Antonio Pérez-Sato, Fernando Carlos Gómez-Merino&lt;/p&gt;

Data generated by the PhIP-Seq assay are unique in many ways. The only published analytical approach for these data suffers from important limitations. Here, we propose a new statistical framework with several improvements. Using a set of replicate mock immunoprecipitations (negative controls lacking antibody input) to generate background binding distributions, we establish a statistical model to quantify antibody-dependent changes in phage clone abundance. Our approach incorporates robust regression of experimental samples against the mock IPs as a means to calculate the expected phage clone abundance, and provides a generalized model for calculating each clone&apos;s expected abundance-associated standard deviation. In terms of bias removal and detection sensitivity, we demonstrate that this z-score algorithm outperforms the previous approach. Further, in a large cohort of autoantibody-defined Sjogren&apos;s Syndrome (SS) patient sera, PhIP-Seq robustly identified Ro52, Ro60, and SSB/La as known autoantigens associated with SS. In an effort to identify novel SS-specific binding specificities, SS z-scores were compared with z-scores obtained by screening Ro-positive sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Data generated by the PhIP-Seq assay are unique in many ways. The only published analytical approach for these data suffers from important limitations. Here, we propose a new statistical framework with several improvements. Using a set of replicate mock immunoprecipitations (negative controls lacking antibody input) to generate background binding distributions, we establish a statistical model to quantify antibody-dependent changes in phage clone abundance. Our approach incorporates robust regression of experimental samples against the mock IPs as a means to calculate the expected phage clone abundance, and provides a generalized model for calculating each clone&apos;s expected abundance-associated standard deviation. In terms of bias removal and detection sensitivity, we demonstrate that this z-score algorithm outperforms the previous approach. Further, in a large cohort of autoantibody-defined Sjogren&apos;s Syndrome (SS) patient sera, PhIP-Seq robustly identified Ro52, Ro60, and SSB/La as known autoantigens associated with SS. In an effort to identify novel SS-specific binding specificities, SS z-scores were compared with z-scores obtained by screening Ro-positive sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This analysis did not yield any commonly targeted SS-specific autoantigens, suggesting that if they exist at all, their epitopes are likely to be discontinuous or post-translationally modified. In summary, we have developed an improved algorithm for PhIP-Seq data analysis, which was validated using a large set of sera with clinically characterized autoantibodies. This z-score approach will substantially improve the ability of PhIP-Seq to detect and interpret antibody binding specificities.

Epidemiological studies have revealed that noise exposure was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the exact nature of that association remains to be elucidated. The present study is designed to examine the effects of chronic noise exposure on the development of T2DM in combination with a high-fat-diet (HFD) in mice. Here we show that chronic noise exposure at 85 dB SPL (4 h /day, below the safety limit for occupational noise exposure) exaggerated multiple metabolic abnormalities induced by HFD in C57BL/6J male mice, including worsened glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, fasting hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, noise exposure exhibited a paradoxical impact on fat accumulation and circulating levels of free fatty acid, indicating a potential stimulating effect of noise on lipolysis. These results provide first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; supporting evidence for the causative role of noise exposure in diabetogenesis and pinpoint a noise-associated increase in blood free fatty acid levels as a possible mediator accelerating the effect of noise on the development of insulin resistance and T2DM.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c5c:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Chronic noise-exposure exacerbates insulin resistance and promotes the manifestations of the type 2 diabetes in a high-fat diet mouse model</title><fingerprint>4b198f0e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lijie Liu, Yi Huang, Cong Fang, Hongyu Zhang, Jing Yang, Chuanying Xuan, Fanfan Wang, Haiying Lu, Shuangfeng Cao, Yongfang Wang, Shengwei Li, Jun Sha, Mingming Zha, Min Guo, Jian Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Genetic variability in insect vectors is valuable to study vector competence determinants and to select non-vector populations that may help reduce the spread of vector-borne pathogens. We collected and tested vector competency of 15 isofemale lines of Asian citrus psyllid, &lt;i&gt;Diaphorina citri&lt;/i&gt;, vector of ‘&lt;i&gt;Candidatus&lt;/i&gt; Liberibacter asiaticus’ (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las is associated with huanglongbing (citrus greening), the most serious citrus disease worldwide. &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults were collected from orange jasmine (&lt;i&gt;Murraya paniculata&lt;/i&gt;) hedges in Florida, and individual pairs (females and males) were caged on healthy &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants for egg laying. The progeny from each pair that tested &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-negative by qPCR were maintained on &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants and considered an isofemale line.

Three lines with mean acquisition rates of 28 to 32%, were classified as ‘good’ acquirers and three other lines were classified as ‘poor’ acquirers, with only 5 to 8% acquisition rates. All lines were further tested for their ability to inoculate &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by confining &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-exposed psyllids for one week onto healthy citrus leaves (6–10 adults/leaf/week), and testing the leaves for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by qPCR. Mean inoculation rates were 19 to 28% for the three good acquirer lines and 0 to 3% for the three poor acquirer lines.

Phenotypic and molecular characterization of one of the good and one of the poor acquirer lines revealed differences between them in color morphs and hemocyanin expression, but not the composition of bacterial endosymbionts.

Understanding the genetic architecture of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las transmission will enable the development of new tools for combating this devastating citrus disease.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0418-368a</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0418-368a</originId><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0418-368a</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><author><name>David S Kong</name></author><published>1522911600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522944970711</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: Open-source, community-driven microfluidics with Metafluidics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: Open-source, community-driven microfluidics with Metafluidics, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0418-368a&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt0418-368a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: Open-source, community-driven microfluidics with Metafluidics</content></content><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_16296980fd7:a46656a:34f43e70</id><title>Erratum: Open-source, community-driven microfluidics with Metafluidics</title><fingerprint>c390bf98</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: Open-source, community-driven microfluidics with Metafluidics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: Open-source, community-driven microfluidics with Metafluidics, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0418-368a&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt0418-368a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: Open-source, community-driven microfluidics with Metafluidics</description></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00139</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00139/20180412/images/medium/ct-2018-00139s_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00139&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensing protein that regulates the function of a large number of proteins, thus playing a crucial part in many cell signaling pathways. CaM has the ability to bind more than 300 different target peptides in a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner, mainly through the exposure of hydrophobic residues. How CaM can bind a large number of targets while retaining some selectivity is a fascinating open question. Here, we explore the mechanism of CaM selective promiscuity for selected target proteins. Analyzing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free CaM via spectral clustering has allowed us to identify distinct conformational states, characterized by interhelical angles, secondary structure determinants and the solvent exposure of specific residues. We searched for indicators of conformational selection by mapping solvent exposure of residues in these conformational states to contacts in structures of CaM/target peptide complexes. We thereby identified CaM states involved in various binding classes arranged along a depth binding gradient. Binding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modifies the accessible hydrophobic surface of the two lobes and allows for deeper binding. Apo CaM indeed shows shallow binding involving predominantly polar and charged residues. Furthermore, binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM appears selective and involves specific conformational states that can facilitate deep binding to target proteins, while binding to the N-terminal lobe appears to happen through a more flexible mechanism. Thus the long-ranged electrostatic interactions of the charged residues of the N-terminal lobe of CaM may initiate binding, while the short-ranged interactions of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM may account for selectivity. This work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nnr4XNya7Zs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1628c98f9e7:49040:a077e55f</id><title>Effect of Ca&amp;lt;sup&gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&gt; on the promiscuous target-protein binding of calmodulin</title><fingerprint>2a2f00b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Annie M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects a large number of people throughout the world. Anxiety, depression and fatigue are common symptoms of SLE that substantially contribute to decreased quality of life. This study investigates the interplay between physical and psychiatric manifestations of lupus. To this end, an SLE patient cohort was examined for correlations between clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and psychological indicators.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy-two lupus patients were evaluated for psychological status using a battery of instruments, including assessments for fatigue (CFS &amp;amp; FSS), depression (HADS), anxiety (HADS), overall health (SF-36 &amp;amp; PSQI) and intimate relationship satisfaction (RAS &amp;amp; CSI). Scores from these assessments were correlated with lupus clinical profiles and laboratory test values.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of depression in the SLE patient cohort was 41.7%, as measured by the hospital depression and anxiety scale. The study identified that pain (p = 0.001), body mass index (p = 0.026), Chalder’s fatigue scale (p &amp;lt; 0.001), fatigue severity scale (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and anxiety (p = 0.001) are all positively correlated with depression in SLE patients. Total complement (CH50) (p = 0.032), and SF-36 physical and mental characteristic assessments are negatively correlated with depression. Longitudinal analysis indicated that the disease related complaint alopecia (p = 0.008) and relationship assessment scale scores (p = 0.004) may also be correlated to depression in SLE patients. Multivariant scrutiny of the clinical and psychosocial characteristics identified the fatigue severity scale (p = 0.026), SF-36 physical function (p = 0.040), physical role function (0.030), and mental health (p = 0.002) as the best indicators directly correlated with depression for the SLE cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results reveal the influence of physical manifestations of lupus including fatigue, pain, body mass index and anxiety, as well as decreased physical and mental function, on depression. Fatigue is the strongest factor correlated with depression in SLE patients in the cohort. Both physical and social/psychological aspects likely contribute to the depression and anxiety in lupus.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ad8:9f3b30f2</id><title>Correlation between physical markers and psychiatric health in a Portuguese systemic lupus erythematosus cohort: The role of suffering in chronic autoimmune disease</title><fingerprint>14635716</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Margarida Figueiredo-Braga, Caleb Cornaby, Miguel Bernardes, Marta Figueiredo, Cristina Dos Santos Mesquita, Lúcia Costa, Brian D.

Both physical and social/psychological aspects likely contribute to the depression and anxiety in lupus.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</link><updated>1523394000000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Lusha Wei</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1523394000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lusha Wei, Tongjing Yan, Yifei Wu, Hui Chen, Baoshan Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

All you have to do to appreciate the horrors of this field is to step into a lab that does it for a living: stacks and stacks and stacks of plates, each with a slightly different set of conditions (buffers, concentrations, additives, protein construct, and son on) to try, once again, to get a protein crystal that diffracts well enough for structure determination. It’s especially tricky to get the ones with your small molecule sitting inside them at its binding site, but when you do, the payoffs can be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing such things at the quality levels needed, though, is an absolute black art. There are trends (sometimes), better ideas about starting points (sometimes), rational modifications of the protein sequence to increase your chances (sometimes), but in the end, it still comes down to relentless empirical try-it-and-see. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25971&quot;&gt;latest paper&lt;/a&gt; (writeup by &lt;em&gt;C&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i15/Cryo-electron-microscopy-reveals-protein.html?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=CEN&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is looking at a well-known protein crystal (glucose isomerase) that is also well known to exist it two polymorphic forms (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/28/down-at-the-crystal-surface&quot;&gt;that last post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject for more on polymorphs). What isn’t well known is why it forms these particular two types of crystals and how that happens. In virtually every case of polymorphism, we have little or no clue about such things, and I’m very glad to see clues starting to be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these authors have done is to start the crystallization process in ammonium sulfate solution and then freeze the solutions (liquid nitrogen) at various time points, imaging the crystals thus found by electron microscopy. And there are some surprises. At the twenty-second time point, there are already “nanorod” crystals forming, which are, on the average, &lt;em&gt;two protein molecules wide and twelve molecules long&lt;/em&gt;. You are not going to get too much earlier in the crystal formation process than that. The concentration of the nanorods increases over time. However, their length does not: they seem stuck at this size. They do start to associate into fibrils as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other things happening as well. There are other species in there (trimer, tetramers, single-file chains), and after about thirty minutes you can also see faceted nanocrystals of the two known bulk polymorphs, one prismatic and rodlike and one rhombic. The smallest of each are in the 100 nM range along their shortest edges. Trying the experiment using PEG instead of ammonium sulfate (another known set of conditions for producing these protein crystals) shows that the useful concentration range for the additive is much narrower, but in both cases, at the low end of the range you get rhombic, and at the high end you get prismatic. With PEG, though, if you keep pushing it, you get no crystals at all, but rather an amorphous gel-like state. And in none of the PEG experiments did they ever observe the nanorods seen in ammonium sulfate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-264x300.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Nature, C&amp;amp;E News&quot; width=&quot;264&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-264x300.jpeg 264w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-300x341.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals.jpeg 700w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13431&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gelation pathway seemed to involve fibril formation as well, which looked in the earlier experiments like it might be a precursor to formation of the rhombic crystals. Weirdly, the authors found that you can take some of that gel and use it to nucleate another protein solution, one that would otherwise form only the rhombic crystals, and form the prismatic crystals with it instead (which is a bizarre thought to me, and probably to a lot of other people who don’t crystallize things for a living). You actually see the crystals growing out of the surface of the lump of gelatinous protein gorp, as shown at right. This is order out of chaos, for sure; I’ll bet that the temperature of the solution at that interface is changing just to make the thermodynamics of all that loss of entropy work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the early stages of crystal formation like this allowed the authors to come up with all the plausible models of the nanorods and compare those to experimental data. One clearly matches better than the rest of them, so now we know what the earliest crystal formation contacts are, and can start to explain why. The preferred mode of contact buries a lot more negative charges in the protein surface, and the paper goes into detail about how this can explain the effects of sulfate ions in the solution versus PEG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it appears that the prismatic crystals (from ammonium sulfate) are made up of bunches of nanorods, rather than growing molecule-by-molecule, which is also contrary to the mental pictures that many of us have. Meanwhile, the rhombic crystals grow more like the traditional picture, monomer by monomer. The nanorod form, though, can also be trapped in a metastable fibril state, starting off as individual fibrils and going on to a gel, with too high an activation energy to dissociate and form prismatic crystals. But its surface can nucleate the formation of such crystals (as in the above photo). At really high PEG concentrations you get a different gel, which is not composed of fibrils, and seems to be a complete dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they don’t see any evidence for, though, is another mode predicted by theory (and which I mentioned in the last post on this stuff): formation of phase-separated nanodroplets that then crystallize. Those nanodroplets take us back to the hot topic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;protein condensates&lt;/a&gt; inside cells, and perhaps its a good thing that they’re not invariably precursors to forming protein crystals (!) That is very likely the reason that such condensates seem to feature intrinsically disordered proteins as well, to avoid the crystallization problem. . .&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are located in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene, are reported to be associated with body weight and the body mass index (BMI). However, their effects on anthropometric measurements in adolescents are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the association of three adjacent polymorphisms (rs9930506, rs9930501, &amp;amp; rs9932754) in the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene with anthropometric indices in Iranian adolescent males.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The participants comprised a total of 237 adolescent males who were recruited randomly from two high schools in Tehran, Iran. The DNA samples were genotyped for the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms by DNA sequencing. BMI, body fat percentage (BF%), and body muscle percentage (BM%) were determined using a validated bioelectrical impedance analysis scale.

For CyberKnife-mediated prostate cancer treatment, a tumour-tracking approach is applied to correct the target location by acquiring X-ray images of implanted fiducial markers intermittently. This study investigated the dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion during CyberKnife treatment. We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients treated using the CyberKnife (35 Gy delivered in five fractions). Using log files of recorded prostate motion, the intra-fraction prostate motion was simulated. We defined the worst-case intra-fraction prostate motion as the difference between pre- and post-deviation on log files and shifted structure sets according to the corresponding offsets for each beam. The dose–volume indices were calculated and compared with the original plan in terms of clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (CTV plus a 2-mm margin), rectum, bladder, and urethra. Prostate motions of &gt;3, &gt;5, and &gt;10 mm were observed for 31.3, 9.1, and 0.5% of the 1929 timestamps, respectively. Relative differences between the simulated and original plans were mostly less than 1%. Although significant decreases were observed in D&lt;sub&gt;50%&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;98%&lt;/sub&gt; of the target, absolute dose differences were &amp;lt;0.1 Gy compared with the planned dose.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype E almost exclusively occurs in African people, and its presence is more commonly associated with the development of chronic HBV (CHB) infection. Moreover, an epidemiological link has been found between the distribution of HBV genotype E infection and African countries with high incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma. As part of a programme for the health assessment of migrants, we evaluated 358 young African subjects for HBV infection; 58.1% (208/358) were positive for an HBV marker, and 54 (25.5%) had CHB. Eighty-one percent of the CHB subjects were infected with HBV genotype E, with a median serum HBV-DNA of 3.2 (IQR: 2.7–3.6) logIU/ml. All patients had high serum HBsAg titres (10,899 [range 5,359–20,272] IU/ml), and no correlation was found between HBsAg titres and HBV-DNA plasma levels. RT sequence analysis showed the presence of a number of immune escape mutations: strains from all of the patients had a serine at HBsAg position 140; 3 also had T116N, Y100C, and P142L+S143L substitutions; and 1 had a G112R substitution. Six (18%) patients had stop-codons at position 216. In 5 of the 9 (26.5%) CHB patients, ultrasound liver biopsy, quantification of total intrahepatic HBV-DNA and cccDNA, and RT/HBsAg sequencing were performed. The median (IQR) total intrahepatic HBV-DNA was 766 (753–1139) copies/1000 cells, and the median (IQR) cccDNA was 17 (10–27) copies/1000 cells. Correlations were observed for both total intrahepatic HBV-DNA and cccDNA with serum HBV-DNA, while no correlation was found for the HBsAg titres. A difference of 2.5/1,000 nucleotides was found in the HBsAg sequences obtained from plasma and from liver tissue, with 3 cases of possible viral anatomical compartmentalization. In conclusion, a high rate of CHB infection due to the E genotype was demonstrated in a group of immigrants from Western Africa. An analysis of the viral strains obtained showed the virological characteristics of immune escape, which may be the cause of viral replication persistence. Moreover, a fair percentage of stop codon mutations were found. The lack of correlation between HBsAg titres and plasma or intrahepatic HBV-DNA found in these subjects suggests a pathway of virus production that is not linked to HBsAg secretion. Studies with a larger number of patients with CHB due to the E genotype are advisable to corroborate these observations.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1e:7d6c1c1c</id><title>High rates of chronic HBV genotype E infection in a group of migrants in Italy from West Africa: Virological characteristics associated with poor immune clearance</title><fingerprint>65b3ef36</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vincenzo Malagnino, Romina Salpini, Gaetano Maffongelli, Arianna Battisti, Lavinia Fabeni, Lorenzo Piermatteo, Luna Colagrossi, Vanessa Fini, Alessandra Ricciardi, Cesare Sarrecchia, Carlo Federico Perno, Massimo Andreoni, Valentina Svicher, Loredana Sarmati&lt;/p&gt;

Studies with a larger number of patients with CHB due to the E genotype are advisable to corroborate these observations.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196300</link><updated>1524517200000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196300</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Allexa Dow</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196300</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196300</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1524517200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Allexa Dow, Sladjana Prisic&lt;/p&gt;
Zinc is an essential micronutrient required for proper structure and function of many proteins. Bacteria regularly encounter zinc depletion and have evolved diverse mechanisms to continue growth when zinc is limited, including the expression of zinc-independent paralogs of zinc-binding proteins. Mycobacteria have a conserved operon encoding four zinc-independent alternative ribosomal proteins (AltRPs) that are expressed when zinc is depleted. It is unknown if mycobacterial AltRPs replace their primary paralogs in the ribosome and maintain protein synthesis under zinc-limited conditions, and if such replacements contribute to their physiology. This study shows that AltRPs from &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; are essential for growth when zinc ion is scarce. Specifically, the deletion mutant of this operon (Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt;) is unable to grow in media containing a high-affinity zinc chelator, while growth of the wild type strain is unaffected under the same conditions. However, when zinc is gradually depleted during growth in zinc-limited medium, the Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; mutant maintains the same growth rate as seen for the wild type strain. In contrast to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; grown with sufficient zinc supplementation that forms shorter cells when transitioning from logarithmic to stationary phase, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; deficient for zinc elongates after the expression of AltRPs in late logarithmic phase. These zinc-depleted bacteria also exhibit a remarkable morphology characterized by a condensed chromosome, increased number of polyphosphate granules, and distinct appearance of lipid bodies and the cell wall compared to the zinc-replete cells. However, the Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; cells fail to elongate and transition into the zinc-limited morphotype, resembling the wild type zinc-replete bacteria instead. Therefore, the &lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; operon in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; has a vital role in continuation of growth when zinc is scarce and in triggering specific morphogenesis during the adaptation to zinc limitation, suggesting that AltRPs can functionally replace their zinc-dependent paralogs, but also contribute to mycobacterial physiology in a unique way.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba3:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Alternative ribosomal proteins are required for growth and morphogenesis of &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium smegmatis&amp;lt;/i&gt; under zinc limiting conditions</title><fingerprint>57aa26da</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allexa Dow, Sladjana Prisic&lt;/p&gt;

Biofilms are microbial collectives that occupy a diverse array of surfaces. It is well known that the function and evolution of biofilms are strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of different strains and species within them, but how spatiotemporal distributions of different genotypes in biofilm populations originate is still underexplored. Here, we study the origins of biofilm genetic structure by combining model development, numerical simulations, and microfluidic experiments using the human pathogen &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt;. Using spatial correlation functions to quantify the differences between emergent cell lineage segregation patterns, we find that strong adhesion often, but not always, maximizes the size of clonal cell clusters on flat surfaces. Counterintuitively, our model predicts that, under some conditions, investing in adhesion can reduce rather than increase clonal group size. Our results emphasize that a complex interaction between fluid flow and cell adhesiveness can underlie emergent patterns of biofilm genetic structure. This structure, in turn, has an outsize influence on how biofilm-dwelling populations function and evolve.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-LcIezdmCHM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d1:bdf8aaf1</id><title>Cell adhesion and fluid flow jointly initiate genotype spatial distribution in biofilms</title><fingerprint>a2273f75</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ricardo Martínez-García, Carey D.

This structure, in turn, has an outsize influence on how biofilm-dwelling populations function and evolve.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-LcIezdmCHM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E4130.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E4130.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E4130.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/17/E4130/F1.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>281</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E4130</canonicalUrl><author><name>Irina Ivanova Vaseva, Enas Qudeimat, Thomas Potuschak, Yunlong Du, Pascal Genschik, Filip Vandenbussche, Dominique Van Der Straeten</name></author><published>1524585995000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1524590032943</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The gaseous hormone ethylene plays a key role in plant growth and development, and it is a major regulator of stress responses.

&lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&lt;/i&gt; is endemic to China and is a new fruit tree species with economic and environmental benefits, with potential developmental and utilization applications. We report the first complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;. Its genome is 158,084 bp in size, and the overall GC content is 36.8%. An inverted repeats (IR) of 52,672 bp in size is separated by a large single-copy (LSC) region of 86,374 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 19,038 bp. The chloroplast genome of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; contains 131 genes including 90 protein-coding genes, 33 transfer RNA genes, and 8 ribosomal RNA genes. The genome has a total 510 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Of these, 306, 149, and 55 were found in the LSC, IR, and SSC regions, respectively. In addition, a comparison of the boundaries of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions of ten other &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species exhibited an overall high degree of sequence similarity, with slight variations in the IR boundary region which included gene deletions, insertions, expansions, and contractions. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; lost the &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRA/SSC border and it has the largest &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRB/SSC border among these &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species, whereas the &lt;i&gt;rps19&lt;/i&gt; gene was inserted at the IRB/LSC junction. Furthermore, phylogenetic reconstruction using 61 conserved coding-protein genes clustered &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Prunus tomentosa&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, the complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; provides a rich source of genetic information for studies on &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; taxonomy, phylogeny, and evolution, as well as lays the foundation for further development and utilization of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fdf3a72a:5f7708:9f3b30f2</id><title>The chloroplast genome of &amp;lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&amp;lt;/i&gt;: Genomic characterization and phylogenetic analysis</title><fingerprint>3962f85c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaopeng Mu, Pengfei Wang, Junjie Du, Yu Gary Gao, Jiancheng Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Although severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis-related diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD), there is no reliable biomarker of CAD risks in patients with OSA. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1-Abs) are associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-two adults diagnosed with OSA by polysomnography, 96 patients with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 64 healthy volunteers (HVs) were consecutively enrolled. Serum samples were collected from patients with OSA at diagnostic polysomnography and from patients with ACS at disease onset. Serum NBL1-Ab level was measured by amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay and its association with clinical variables related to atherosclerosis was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;NBL1-Ab level was significantly elevated in patients with both OSA and ACS compared with HVs. Subgroup analyses showed that NBL1-Ab level was markedly higher in patients with severe OSA and OSA patients with a history of CAD. Weak associations were observed between NBL1-Ab level and apnea-hypopnea index, age, mean SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and arousal index, whereas significantly higher NBL1-Ab levels were observed in OSA patients with a history of CAD than in those without a history of CAD. Sensitivity analysis using a logistic regression model also demonstrated that increased NBL1-Ab levels were associated with the previous history of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Elevated NBL1-Ab levels may be associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA, which needs to be confirmed further.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1a:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1): A potential biomarker for coronary artery disease in patients with obstructive sleep apnea</title><fingerprint>b0341bac</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takuma Matsumura, Jiro Terada, Taku Kinoshita, Yoriko Sakurai, Misuzu Yahaba, Kenji Tsushima, Seiichiro Sakao, Kengo Nagashima, Toshinori Ozaki, Yoshio Kobayashi, Takaki Hiwasa, Koichiro Tatsumi&lt;/p&gt;

One of the more fundamental health policy questions is the relationship between health care quality and spending. A better understanding of these relationships is needed to inform health systems interventions aimed at increasing quality and efficiency of care. We measured 65 validated quality indicators (QI) across Ontario physician networks. QIs were aggregated into domains representing six dimensions of care: screening and prevention, evidence-based medications, hospital-community transitions (7-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician; 30-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician and specialist), potentially avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable readmissions and unplanned returns to the ED, and poor cancer end of life care. Each domain rate was computed as a weighted average of QI rates, weighting by network population at risk. We also measured overall and sector-specific per capita healthcare network spending. We evaluated the associations between domain rates, and between domain rates and spending using weighted correlations, weighting by network population at risk, using an ecological design. All indicators were measured using Ontario health administrative databases. Large variations were seen in timely hospital-community transitions and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Networks with timely hospital-community transitions had lower rates of avoidable admissions and readmissions (r = -0.89, -0.58, respectively). Higher physician spending, especially outpatient primary care spending, was associated with lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations (r = -0.83) and higher rates of timely hospital-community transitions (r = 0.81) and moderately associated with lower readmission rates (r = -0.46). Investment in effective primary care services may help reduce burden on the acute care sector and associated expenditures.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5c:34f43e70</id><title>Association between quality domains and health care spending across physician networks</title><fingerprint>13e993e5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Farah Rahman, Jun Guan, Richard H.

Violent acts on university campuses are becoming more frequent. Enrollment rates of Latinos at universities is increasing. Research has indicated that youths are more susceptible to trauma, particularly Latinos. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate the validity of commonly used posttraumatic stress measures among Latino college students. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) is one of the most commonly used metrics of posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. However, it is largely unknown if the IES-R is measuring the same construct across different sub-samples (e.g. Latino versus non-Latino). The current study aimed to assess measurement invariance for the IES-R between Latino and non-Latino participants. A total of 545 participants completed the IES-R. One- and three-factor scoring solutions were compared using confirmatory factor analyses. Measurement invariance was then evaluated by estimating several multiple-group confirmatory factor analytic models. Four models with an increasing degree of invariance across groups were compared. A significant χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; difference test was used to indicate a significant change in model fit between nested models within the measurement invariance testing process. The three-factor scoring solution could not be used for the measurement invariance process because the subscale correlations were too high for estimation (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;s 0.92–1.00). Therefore, the one-factor model was used for the invariance testing process. Invariance was met for each level of invariance: configural, metric, scalar, and strict. All measurement invariance testing results indicated that the one-factor solution for the IES-R was equivalent for the Latino and non-Latino participants.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5d:34f43e70</id><title>The performance of the IES-R for Latinos and non-Latinos: Assessing measurement invariance</title><fingerprint>fc68bb5d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jitske Tiemensma, Sarah Depaoli, Sonja D.

The occurrence of water stress during wheat growth is more frequent due to climate change. Three experiments (cyclic drought, cyclic waterlogging, and cyclic drought plus waterlogging) were conducted to investigate the effects of mild and severe cyclic/single water stress at elongation and heading stages on winter wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt; L.) yield. The effect of either mild drought at elongation or mild waterlogging at heading on wheat yield was not significant; however, significance did occur under other single water stresses. As the stress becomes more severe, the yield loss significantly increases. Extreme drought/waterlogging treatment at elongation caused a greater yield penalty than stress at heading stage. Except the combination of mild drought and mild waterlogging treatment, cyclic water stress significantly decreased wheat yields. The decrease in wheat yield under cyclic severe drought and waterlogging was significantly higher than any other treatment, with percentage decreases of 71.52 and 73.51%, respectively. In general, a yield reduction from mild cyclic water stress did not indicate more severe damage than single treatments; in contrast, grain yield suffered more when water stress occurred again after severe drought and waterlogging. Drought during elongation significantly decreased kernel number, whereas drought at heading/waterlogging during elongation and heading decreased the spike weight, which might be the main reason for the yield penalty. Furthermore, water stress caused variation in the decrease of total biomass and/or harvest index. The present study indicates comprehensive understanding of the types, degree, and stages of water stress are essential for assessing the impact of multiple water stresses on wheat yield.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715295:9aea0a7d</id><title>Does cyclic water stress damage wheat yield more than a single stress?</title><fingerprint>84746a3f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinfeng Ding, Zhengjin Huang, Min Zhu, Chunyan Li, Xinkai Zhu, Wenshan Guo&lt;/p&gt;

The study aimed to compare the chronic eccentric-overload training effects of unilateral (lateral lunge) vs bilateral (half-squat) using an inertial device, on hypertrophy and physical performance. Twenty-seven young team sports male players performed a 4 sets of 7 repetitions of inertial eccentric overload training, biweekly for 6 weeks, distributed in unilateral lunge group (UG: age: 22.8 ± 2.9 years; body mass: 75.3 ± 8.8 kg; height: 177.3 ± 3.7 cm) and bilateral squat group (BG: age: 22.6 ± 2.7 years; body mass: 79.5 ± 12.8 kg; height: 164.2 ± 7 cm). Lower limb muscle volume, counter movement jump (CMJ), power with both (POWER), dominant (POWERd) and no-dominant leg (POWERnd), change of direction turn of 90° with dominant (COD90d) and no-dominant leg (COD90nd) and 180° (COD180d and COD180nd), and 10m sprint time (T-10m) were measured pre and post-intervention. The UG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;adductor major&lt;/i&gt; (+11.1%) and &lt;i&gt;vastus medialis&lt;/i&gt; (+12.6%) higher than BG. The BG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;vastus lateralis&lt;/i&gt; (+9.9%) and &lt;i&gt;lateral gastrocnemius&lt;/i&gt; (+9.1%) higher than UG. Both groups improved CMJ, POWER, POWERd, POWERnd, COD90 and DEC-COD90, without changes in T-10m. The UG decrease DEC-COD90nd (-21.1%) and BG increase POWER (+38.6%) substantially more than the other group. Six-weeks of unilateral / bilateral EO training induce substantial improvements in lower limbs muscle volume and functional performance, although unilateral training seems to be more effective in improving COD90 performance.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2803:7d6c1c1c</id><title>The effects of unilateral and bilateral eccentric overload training on hypertrophy, muscle power and COD performance, and its determinants, in team sport players</title><fingerprint>89b168dc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Francisco Javier Núñez, Alfredo Santalla, Irene Carrasquila, Jose Antonio Asian, Jose Ignacio Reina, Luis Jesús Suarez-Arrones&lt;/p&gt;

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. On high-resolution manometry (HRM), impaired LES relaxation is defined by elevated integrated relaxation pressure (IRP). However, a new category of achalasia within the normal IRP range has been suggested.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;HRM was performed using a Starlet device and an IRP threshold of 26 mmHg. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) was performed for cases of achalasia diagnosed using established methods. During POEM, the histology of the LES was assessed. Follow-up was performed 2 months post-operatively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-one patients with achalasia (18 women, mean age 53 ± 18.6 years) were included. Among them, 27 were placed in the IRP &gt; 26 mmHg subgroup (impaired LES relaxation on HRM) and 14 in the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup (normal LES relaxation on HRM). In the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup, patients were older, had longer symptom duration, and had more esophageal dilation. The IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup had the same symptom severity as the higher IRP subgroup and POEM significantly improved symptoms and IRP, although four patients still had severe LES fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The clinical presentation of achalasia has a gap between a HRM-defined impaired LES relaxation, with aging or disease progression considered reasons for a lowered LES pressure. POEM can be a feasible treatment option, even for cases of achalasia with a normal IRP. However, patients with severe LES fibrosis need more attention for the therapeutic indication.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7693c:7d6c1c1c</id><title>A clinical study of peroral endoscopic myotomy reveals that impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation in achalasia is not only defined by high-resolution manometry</title><fingerprint>a5b0a478</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hiroki Sato, Kazuya Takahashi, Ken-ichi Mizuno, Satoru Hashimoto, Junji Yokoyama, Shuji Terai&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum&lt;/i&gt; is a thermophilic anaerobe that has been engineered to produce high amounts of ethanol, reaching ~90% theoretical yield at a titer of 70 g/L. Here we report the physiological changes that occur upon deleting the redox-sensing transcriptional regulator Rex in wild type &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;saccharolyticum&lt;/i&gt;: a single deletion of &lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; resulted in a two-fold increase in ethanol yield (from 40% to 91% theoretical yield), but the resulting strains grew only about a third as fast as the wild type strain. Deletion of the &lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; gene also had the effect of increasing expression of alcohol dehydrogenase genes, &lt;i&gt;adhE&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;adhA&lt;/i&gt;. After several serial transfers, the ethanol yield decreased from an average of 91% to 55%, and the growth rates had increased. We performed whole-genome resequencing to identify secondary mutations in the Δ&lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; strains adapted for faster growth. In several cases, secondary mutations had appeared in the &lt;i&gt;adhE&lt;/i&gt; gene. Furthermore, in these strains the NADH-linked alcohol dehydrogenase activity was greatly reduced. Complementation studies were done to reintroduce &lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; into the Δ&lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; strains: reintroducing &lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; decreased ethanol yield to below wild type levels in the Δ&lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; strain without &lt;i&gt;adhE&lt;/i&gt; mutations, but did not change the ethanol yield in the Δ&lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; strain where an &lt;i&gt;adhE&lt;/i&gt; mutation occurred.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f45fd:34f43e70</id><title>The redox-sensing protein Rex modulates ethanol production in &amp;lt;i&gt;Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>406e51cd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tianyong Zheng, Anthony A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The appropriate use of clinically accurate diagnostic tests is essential for the detection of pertussis, a poorly controlled vaccine-preventable disease. The purpose of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic criteria including culture, multi-target polymerase chain reaction (PCR), anti-pertussis toxin IgG (IgG-PT) serology, and the use of a clinical case definition. An additional objective was to describe the optimal timing of specimen collection for the various tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Clinical specimens were collected from patients with cough illness at seven locations across the United States between 2007 and 2011. Nasopharyngeal and blood specimens were collected from each patient during the enrollment visit. Patients who had been coughing for ≤ 2 weeks were asked to return in 2–4 weeks for collection of a second, convalescent blood specimen. Sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic test were estimated using three methods—pertussis culture as the “gold standard,” composite reference standard analysis (CRS), and latent class analysis (LCA).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 868 patients were enrolled and 13.6% were &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pertussis&lt;/i&gt; positive by at least one diagnostic test. In a sample of 545 participants with non-missing data on all four diagnostic criteria, culture was 64.0% sensitive, PCR was 90.6% sensitive, and both were 100% specific by LCA. CRS and LCA methods increased the sensitivity estimates for convalescent serology and the clinical case definition over the culture-based estimates. Culture and PCR were most sensitive when performed during the first two weeks of cough; serology was optimally sensitive after the second week of cough.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Timing of specimen collection in relation to onset of illness should be considered when ordering diagnostic tests for pertussis.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia, developmental delay, incomplete sexual development, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a variety of challenging behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The characteristics of PWS can be difficult for caregivers to cope with and are likely to cause significant and long- term caregiver burden. The current study examined burden in 142 caregivers of children and adults with PWS living in the US using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The study aimed to measure the level of burden in caregivers of individuals with PWS, to explore the impact of PWS on caregiver quality of life, and to assess ZBI as an indicator of that impact.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Caregivers participating in this study were predominantly mothers, 30–59 years old, non-Hispanic Whites, married or in a relationship, with an annual household income slightly distributed towards higher income. Nearly 90% of the caregiver`s children with PWS lived at home. Caregivers experienced high caregiver burden with an average ZBI score of 44.4 ± 15.4. ZBI scores were highest for caregivers of teenage and young adult individuals with PWS (49.2 ± 14.6 and 49.2 ± 14.1, respectively), while those caring for older adults (&gt;30) and the youngest age group had lower scores (38.6 ±10.5 and 34.8 ±12.5, respectively). Caregivers reported that caring for a person with PWS negatively impacted their romantic relationship, ability to work, sleep, and mood. Whereas we did not find strong correlations between family income or level of help the caregiver receives and ZBI scores, the results showed significant correlations and a linear relationship between ZBI scores and caregiver depressed mood, feelings of anxiety, negative romantic relationship impact, as well as sleep and work disruption.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study reveals that PWS incurs high caregiver burden and impacts many aspects of the lives of caregiver. We identified the ZBI as a good predictor of that impact. Our findings draw attention to the critical unmet need for support for caregivers of individuals with PWS.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5ed:7d6c1c1c</id><title>High levels of caregiver burden in Prader-Willi syndrome</title><fingerprint>f86d40e5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathalie Kayadjanian, Lauren Schwartz, Evan Farrar, Katherine Anne Comtois, Theresa V.

The forces driving the accumulation and removal of non-coding DNA and ultimately the evolution of genome size in complex organisms are intimately linked to genome structure and organisation. Our analysis provides a novel method for capturing the regional variation of lineage-specific DNA gain and loss events in their respective genomic contexts. To further understand this connection we used comparative genomics to identify genome-wide individual DNA gain and loss events in the human and mouse genomes. Focusing on the distribution of DNA gains and losses, relationships to important structural features and potential impact on biological processes, we found that in autosomes, DNA gains and losses both followed separate lineage-specific accumulation patterns. However, in both species chromosome X was particularly enriched for DNA gain, consistent with its high L1 retrotransposon content required for X inactivation. We found that DNA loss was associated with gene-rich open chromatin regions and DNA gain events with gene-poor closed chromatin regions. Additionally, we found that DNA loss events tended to be smaller than DNA gain events suggesting that they were able to accumulate in gene-rich open chromatin regions due to their reduced capacity to interrupt gene regulatory architecture.

Buckley, R. Daniel Kortschak, David L. Adelson&lt;/p&gt;
The forces driving the accumulation and removal of non-coding DNA and ultimately the evolution of genome size in complex organisms are intimately linked to genome structure and organisation. Our analysis provides a novel method for capturing the regional variation of lineage-specific DNA gain and loss events in their respective genomic contexts. To further understand this connection we used comparative genomics to identify genome-wide individual DNA gain and loss events in the human and mouse genomes. Focusing on the distribution of DNA gains and losses, relationships to important structural features and potential impact on biological processes, we found that in autosomes, DNA gains and losses both followed separate lineage-specific accumulation patterns. However, in both species chromosome X was particularly enriched for DNA gain, consistent with its high L1 retrotransposon content required for X inactivation. We found that DNA loss was associated with gene-rich open chromatin regions and DNA gain events with gene-poor closed chromatin regions. Additionally, we found that DNA loss events tended to be smaller than DNA gain events suggesting that they were able to accumulate in gene-rich open chromatin regions due to their reduced capacity to interrupt gene regulatory architecture. GO term enrichment showed that mouse loss hotspots were strongly enriched for terms related to developmental processes. However, these genes were also located in regions with a high density of conserved elements, suggesting that despite high levels of DNA loss, gene regulatory architecture remained conserved. This is consistent with a model in which DNA gain and loss results in turnover or “churning” in regulatory element dense regions of open chromatin, where interruption of regulatory elements is selected against.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H1rMm4y09CQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/434/eaat3883?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/434/eaat3883?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/434/eaat3883?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/434/eaat3883.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Jones, R.

Studies disrupting the chemokine pathway CX3CL1 (fractalkine)/ CX3CR1 have shown decreased atherosclerosis in animal models but the techniques used to interrupt the pathway have not been easily translatable into human trials. DNA vaccination potentially overcomes the translational difficulties. We evaluated the effect of a DNA vaccine, targeted to CX3CR1, on atherosclerosis in a murine model and examined possible mechanisms of action. DNA vaccination against CX3CR1, enhanced by dendritic cell targeting using DEC-205 single chain variable region fragment (scFv), was performed in 8 week old ApoE-/- mice, fed a normal chow diet. High levels of anti-CX3CR1 antibodies were induced in vaccinated mice. There were no apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine. Arterial vessels of 34 week old mice were examined histologically for atherosclerotic plaque size, macrophage infiltration, smooth muscle cell infiltration and lipid deposition. Vaccinated mice had significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque in the brachiocephalic artery. There was less macrophage infiltration but no significant change to the macrophage phenotype in the plaques. There was less lipid deposition in the lesions, but there was no effect on smooth muscle cell migration. Targeted DNA vaccination to CX3CR1 was well tolerated, induced a strong immune response and resulted in attenuated atherosclerotic lesions with reduced macrophage infiltration. DNA vaccination against chemokine pathways potentially offers a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3c9:34f43e70</id><title>DEC205-DC targeted DNA vaccine against CX3CR1 protects against atherogenesis in mice</title><fingerprint>4cb30a82</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jimmy Jianheng Zhou, Yuan Min Wang, Vincent W.

α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies found in synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Under the pathological conditions, α-syn tends to generate a diverse form of aggregates showing toxicity to neuronal cells and able to transmit across cells. However, mechanisms by which α-syn aggregates affect cytotoxicity in neurons have not been fully elucidated. Here we report that α-syn aggregates preferentially sequester specific synaptic proteins such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) through direct binding which is resistant to SDS. The sequestration effect of α-syn aggregates was shown in a cell-free system, cultured primary neurons, and PD mouse model. Furthermore, we identified a specific blocking peptide derived from VAMP2 which partially inhibited the sequestration by α-syn aggregates and contributed to reduced neurotoxicity. These results provide a mechanism of neurotoxicity mediated by α-syn aggregates and suggest that the blocking peptide interfering with the pathological role of α-syn aggregates could be useful for designing a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of PD.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76935:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Sequestration of synaptic proteins by alpha-synuclein aggregates leading to neurotoxicity is inhibited by small peptide</title><fingerprint>55727e5b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mal-Gi Choi, Mi Jin Kim, Do-Geun Kim, Ri Yu, You-Na Jang, Won-Jong Oh&lt;/p&gt;

Bacteriophage TP-84 is a well-characterized bacteriophage of historical interest. It is a member of the &lt;i&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/i&gt;, and infects a number of thermophilic &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;stearothermophilus&lt;/i&gt; strains. Its’ 47.7-kbp double-stranded DNA genome revealed the presence of 81 coding sequences (CDSs) coding for polypeptides of 4 kDa or larger. Interestingly, all CDSs are oriented in the same direction, pointing to a dominant transcription direction of one DNA strand. Based on a homology search, a hypothetical function could be assigned to 31 CDSs. No RNA or DNA polymerase-coding genes were found on the bacteriophage genome indicating that TP-84 relies on the host’s transcriptional and replication enzymes. The TP84 genome is tightly packed with CDSs, typically spaced by several-to-tens of bp or often overlapping. The genome contains five putative promoter-like sequences showing similarity to the host promoter consensus sequence and allowing for a 2-bp mismatch. In addition, ten putative rho-independent terminators were detected. Because the genome sequence shows essentially no similarity to any previously characterised bacteriophage, TP-84 should be considered a new species in an undefined genus within the &lt;i&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/i&gt; family. Thus a taxonomic proposal of a new &lt;i&gt;Tp84virus&lt;/i&gt; genus has been accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The bioinformatics genome analysis was verified by confirmation of 33 TP-84 proteins, which included: a) cloning of a selected CDS in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, coding for a DNA single-stranded binding protein (SSB; gene TP84_63), b) purification and functional assays of the recombinant TP-84 SSB, which has been shown to improve PCR reactions, c) mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of TP-84 bacteriophage capsid proteins, d) purification of TP-84 endolysin activity, e) MS analysis of the host cells from infection time course.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd07b:7c9981b6</id><title>Sequence, genome organization, annotation and proteomics of the thermophilic, 47.7-kb &amp;lt;i&gt;Geobacillus stearothermophilus&amp;lt;/i&gt; bacteriophage TP-84 and its classification in the new &amp;lt;i&gt;Tp84virus&amp;lt;/i&gt; genus</title><fingerprint>6006a444</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Piotr M.

So this is a good field for both miniaturized reaction searching (as in the link above) and for machine learning (as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/186&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s going after what’s often an even more challenging case, the C-N &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchwald%E2%80%93Hartwig_amination&quot;&gt;Buchwald-Hartwig&lt;/a&gt; coupling. That one gets used a lot in medicinal chemistry (we like nitrogen atoms), but it’s also a well-known beast when it comes to variation in yield. You can honestly never be quite sure that it’s going to work well when you set it up on a new system for the first time, because there are a lot of conditions (solvent, catalyst, additives) to pick from, and often very little guidance about which region of reaction space is going to be most fruitful. This work, a Princeton/Merck collaboration, is an attempt to calculate a way out of the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the two approaches mentioned in the first paragraph are not an either/or case. Far from it. If you’re going to do machine learning, you’re going to need a lot of reliable data (positive and negative) to feed into the model, and how better to generate that than in an automated, high-throughput setup? That’s especially true as you start adding in more reaction variables: every one of those can increase the complexity of the machine learning model in an exponential fashion, and stuff gets out of control quickly under those conditions. So the question is, can ML provide something useful here, and can it outperform the simpler-to-implement regression models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d definitely want robotic help up front: the data set was the yields from 4,608 coupling reactions  (15 aryl or heteroaryl halides, 4 ligands, 3 bases, and 23 isoxazole additives). About 30% of the reactions gave no product at all – valuable fodder for the model – and the rest were spread in a wide range from “pretty darn good” to “truly crappy”. Just what you need. At this point, you need to figure out just what you’re going to tell the system about these reactions (a nontrivial decision). Too few (or wrongly chosen) parameters, and you’ll never get a useful model. Too many, and you risk an overfitted model that looks good from a distance but is both hard to implement and still not robust. In this case, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartan_(software)&quot;&gt;Spartan&lt;/a&gt; program &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/02/14/science.aar5169.DC1/aar5169-Ahenman-SM_revision_1.pdf&quot;&gt;is used to provide&lt;/a&gt; atomic, molecular, and vibrational descriptors of the substrate(s), catalysts, bases, and additives. So what goes in are electrostatics at various atoms, vibrational modes (frequencies and intensities), dipole moments, electronegativity, surface areas, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the team took 70% of the data as a training set to see if they could predict the outcomes in the other 30%, and ran the data through a whole set of possibilities: linear and polynomial regression for starters, then k-nearest neighbors, Bayes-generalized linear models, layered neural networks, random-forest techniques, etc. Only when they got to that last two did they start to see real predictive value, and random-forest seems to have been the clear winner. Its predictions, even using only 5% of the data, were better than linear-regression models tuned up on the whole 70%. But even so, there were limits. “Activity cliffs” are always a problem in these reactions, and those are hard to pick up (even with 4,608 reactions to train on!) The wider the range of chemical/reaction space you’re trying to cover with your model, the better the chance you’re going to miss these things (and the better the chance you’re going to end up with an overfitted model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way out of that is to restrict your question to a narrower region of potential reactions (and thus get more fine detail into the model). But that, naturally, makes it less useful: after all, the dream is a Buchwald-Hartwig Box, where you walk up, draw the structures of your two reactants (no matter what they might be), and it pauses for a moment and spits out a set of good reaction conditions. That’s. . .still a little ways off. But I do have to say that this current effort beats both human intuition (insofar as anyone has any about these reactions) and other attempts to calculate likely starting points. So it is a real improvement, and the finding that random-forest techniques outperformed everything else is worth building on, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group did try putting in some additives that were not in the training set at all, to see how the model would handle them. And the answer is “not bad”: the root-mean-square error in predicted yields for the original test set versus reference set was about 8%, and the RMSE for the new additive set was about 11%. So it was not quite as good, but on the right track. (By comparison, the single-layer neural network model had about a 10% error on the original set, while the other methods came in at 15 to 16%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggested a look at the final random-forest procedure to see if there was anything that could be learned about the mechanism (a tall order, from what I know about the field). Some of the most important descriptors were things like electrostatic charge on the isoxazole additive’s atoms, its calculated LUMO, and its carbon NMR shifts. That suggests that the additive’s electrophilic behavior was important, but those parameters taken by themselves weren’t enough to produce any kind of useful model on their own. Still, a check of isoxazoles from both ends of the scale suggested that the more electrophilic ones were capable of undergoing a side reaction with the Pd catalyst that reduced yields, which may well be what the model was picking up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’d say that this paper does show (as have some others) that machine-learning techniques are going to help us out eventually in predicting reaction conditions, even if that day has not quite arrived. When you get down to it, the parameters going into this model are not particularly complicated, so it may well be a good sign that it’s worked as well as it has. You’d have to think that larger data sets and new inputs can only going to make these things perform better (after plenty of human effort and care, of course), and that’s leaving aside the general possibility of improved algorithms. I think we’ll get there, but we’re not there now.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162fcdc8e09:3dd4d2:91749e5b</id><title>Calculate Your Way Out of Bad Yields</title><fingerprint>59032214</fingerprint><description>I wrote a little while back about a brute-force approach to finding metal-catalyzed coupling conditions.

Prevalent anuric peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients usually have higher mortality than PD patients with residual urine volume. We aimed to evaluate the predictors of survival in anuric PD patients. Anuric PD patients (n = 505, &amp;lt;100 mL of daily urine) enrolled in Korean nationwide prospective cohort were analyzed. Survived and non-survived anuric PD patients were compared by propensity score matching analysis with a ratio of two to one. The propensity method was used to adjust for patient age, dialysis duration, and presence of diabetes. Among the total anuric PD patients, non-survived patients showed a significantly older age, higher incidence of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and arrhythmia, and lower serum creatinine and albumin. After propensity score matching, multivariate Cox regression analysis for patient survival showed a decreasing risk as serum albumin increased (HR = 0.347, p = 0.0094). Analysis using the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve showed that survival could be predicted with a sensitivity of 59.4% and a specificity of 63.2% using a cutoff value of 3.6 g/dL of serum albumin in unmatched total PD patients. The beneficial impact of high albumin level on death was significantly greater for patients with older age (≥50 years), no diabetes, low ultrafiltration (UF) volume (&amp;lt;1000 mL/day), and low levels of serum creatinine (&amp;lt;10 mg/dL), total cholesterol (&amp;lt;177.5 mg/dL), ferritin (&amp;lt;100 ng/mL), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (&amp;lt;0.1 mg/dL). Survival in anuric PD patients was associated with age, comorbidities, and nutritional factors such as creatinine and albumin. After adjustment by propensity score matching, serum albumin level was an independent predictor for survival in anuric PD patients.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fdf3a72a:5f7706:9f3b30f2</id><title>Survival predictors in anuric patients on peritoneal dialysis: A prospective, multicenter, propensity score-matched cohort study</title><fingerprint>dd3e8504</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ja-Yong Park, Jang-Hee Cho, Hye Min Jang, Yon Su Kim, Shin-Wook Kang, Chul Woo Yang, Nam-Ho Kim, Ji-Young Choi, Sun-Hee Park, Chan-Duck Kim, Yong-Lim Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Product packaging has long been used by the tobacco industry to target consumers and manipulate product perceptions. This study examines the extent to which cigarillo packaging influences perceptions of product flavor, taste, smell, and appeal.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A web-based experiment was conducted among young adults. Participants viewed three randomly selected cigarillo packs, varying on pack flavor descriptor, color, type, branding, and warning—totaling 180 pack images. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effect of pack elements on product perceptions.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 2,664 current, ever, and never little cigar and cigarillo users participated. Cigarillo packs with a flavor descriptor were perceived as having a more favorable taste (β = 0.21, p &amp;lt; .001) and smell (β = 0.14, p &amp;lt; .001) compared to packs with no flavor descriptor. Compared to packs with no color, pink and purple packs were more likely to be perceived as containing a flavor (β = 0.11, p &amp;lt; .001), and were rated more favorably on taste (β = 0.17, p &amp;lt; .001), smell (β = 0.15, p &amp;lt; .001), and appeal (β = 0.16, p &amp;lt; .001). While warnings on packs decreased favorable perceptions of product taste (pictorial: β = -0.07, p = .03) and smell (text-only: β = -0.08, p = .01; pictorial: β = -0.09, p = .007), warnings did not moderate the effects of flavor descriptor or color.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantitative evidence that cigarillo packaging alters consumers’ cognitive responses, and warnings on packs do not suffice to overcome the effects of product packaging. The findings support efforts at federal, state, and local levels to prohibit flavor descriptors and their associated product flavoring in non-cigarette products such as cigarillos, along with new data that supports restrictions on flavor cues and colors.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f7902:7d6c1c1c</id><title>The effect of cigarillo packaging elements on young adult perceptions of product flavor, taste, smell, and appeal</title><fingerprint>fab54a29</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Clare Meernik, Leah M.

Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20–100%, 150 BAM files in total). To demonstrate feasibility beyond exome data, we introduced read alignments to a targeted 5-gene cell-free DNA sequencing library to simulate &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; amplifications at frequencies consistent with circulating tumor DNA (10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01%) while retaining the multimodal insert size distribution of the original data. We expect Bamgineer to be of use for development and systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms by users using locally-generated data for a variety of applications.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The aim of this investigation was to analyze the influence of the genetic variations of the -163C&gt;A polymorphism of the CYP1A2 gene on the ergogenic effects of caffeine in elite basketball players.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Nineteen elite basketball players (10 men and 9 women) ingested 3 mg⋅kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of caffeine or a placebo 60 min before performing 10 repetitions of the following series: the Abalakov jump test followed by the Change-of-Direction and Acceleration Test (CODAT). The players then competed in a 20-min simulated basketball game. Self-perceived performance and side effects were recorded by questionnaires after the trials. The effects of caffeine on basketball performance were established according to players’ CYP1A2 genotype (rs762551): AA homozygotes (n = 10) and C-allele carriers (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the 10 repetitions, caffeine increased Abalakov jump height by a mean of 2.9±3.6% in AA homozygotes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) while this effect did not reach statistical significance for C-allele carriers (2.3 ± 6.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.33). Caffeine did not affect sprint time in the CODAT test in either genotype group but it increased the number of impacts performed during the simulated game in both AA homozygotes (4.1 ± 5.3%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) and C-allele carriers (3.3 ± 3.2%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01).

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The aim of this investigation was to analyze the influence of the genetic variations of the -163C&gt;A polymorphism of the CYP1A2 gene on the ergogenic effects of caffeine in elite basketball players.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Nineteen elite basketball players (10 men and 9 women) ingested 3 mg⋅kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of caffeine or a placebo 60 min before performing 10 repetitions of the following series: the Abalakov jump test followed by the Change-of-Direction and Acceleration Test (CODAT). The players then competed in a 20-min simulated basketball game. Self-perceived performance and side effects were recorded by questionnaires after the trials. The effects of caffeine on basketball performance were established according to players’ CYP1A2 genotype (rs762551): AA homozygotes (n = 10) and C-allele carriers (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the 10 repetitions, caffeine increased Abalakov jump height by a mean of 2.9±3.6% in AA homozygotes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) while this effect did not reach statistical significance for C-allele carriers (2.3 ± 6.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.33). Caffeine did not affect sprint time in the CODAT test in either genotype group but it increased the number of impacts performed during the simulated game in both AA homozygotes (4.1 ± 5.3%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) and C-allele carriers (3.3 ± 3.2%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01). During the 24 h following the test, AA homozygotes tended to experience increased insomnia with caffeine while C-allele carriers did not present this effect. The remaining variables were unaffected by the genotype.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The CYP1A2 -163C&gt;A polymorphism minimally altered the ergogenicity derived from the consumption of a moderate dose of caffeine in elite basketball players.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3404.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3404.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3404.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3404</canonicalUrl><author><name>Charles Thevenin, Maud Mouchet, Alexandre Robert, Christian Kerbiriou, Francois Sarrazin</name></author><published>1522168915000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1522172947982</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Reintroductions offer a powerful tool for reversing the effects of species extirpation and have been increasingly used over recent decades.

We aimed to determine the effects of levodopa medication on the performance of a repetitive pointing task while standing, and to investigate the optimal trial duration in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, and older adults. Seventeen individuals with Parkinson’s disease (5 freezers) and 9 older adults stood on force platforms for 30 s and 120 s while performing a bilateral repetitive pointing task, tracked by motion capture. Participants with Parkinson’s disease were assessed on and off medication and older adults were also assessed on separate days. The main findings were that: 1) on medication, participants with Parkinson’s exhibited greater center of pressure root mean square in the medial-lateral direction, greater velocity in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions, and greater range in the medial-lateral direction than off medication; 2) longer trial durations resulted in greater center of pressure range in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions and greater coefficient of variation in finger pointing on the least affected side; 3) Parkinson’s participants exhibited larger range in the medial-lateral direction compared to older adults; 4) off medication, freezers presented with less range and root mean square in the anterior-posterior direction than non-freezers; and 5) a correlation emerged between the freezing of gait questionnaire and pointing asymmetry and the coefficient of variation of pointing on the most affected side. Therefore, Parkinson’s medication may increase instability during a repetitive pointing task. Longer trials may provide a better depiction of sway by discriminating between those with and without neurological impairment. Individuals with Parkinson’s were less stable than older adults, supporting that they are at a greater risk for falls. The greater restrictive postural strategy in freezers compared to non-freezers is likely a factor that augments fall-risk. Lastly, the link between freezing of gait and upper-limb movement indicates that freezing may manifest first in the lower-limbs.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460d:34f43e70</id><title>Medication and trial duration influence postural and pointing parameters during a standing repetitive pointing task in individuals with Parkinson’s disease</title><fingerprint>15afb55e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Deborah A.

Natural substances are used in folk medicines to treat injuries. &lt;i&gt;Strychnos pseudoquina&lt;/i&gt; has scarring, antipyretic, and antimalarial actions. The present study aimed to analyze the effect of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudoquina&lt;/i&gt; on cutaneous wound healing in rats. The &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudoquina&lt;/i&gt; extract was submitted to phytochemical prospection. The levels of flavonoids and total phenolic compounds in the extract were 50.7 mg/g and 2.59 mg/g, respectively. Thirty Wistar rats were individualized in cages with food and water &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; (registration no. 730/2014). After anesthesia, three circular wounds (12mm diameter) were made in the animals, which were randomly separated into five treatments: Sal, saline; VO, ointment vehicles (lanolin and Vaseline); SS, positive control (silver sulfadiazine 1%); LE 5, freeze-dried extract 5%; and LE 10, lyophilized extract 10%. The animals were treated with the ointment daily for 21 days. Every seven days, the area and the rate of wound contraction were evaluated. Tissue samples were removed for histopathological analysis of the number of mast cells, elastic and collagen fibers, and biochemical analyses, quantification of malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonylated proteins (PCN), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), Interleukin 10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The number of mast cells, collagen and elastic fibers in the rat wounds were higher in the treatments with the plant. The extract also stimulated the activity of antioxidant enzymes, particularly SOD, presenting high levels, and maintained low levels of PCN. The TGF-β and IL-10 concentration was higher in the LE5 and LE10 treatment of the extract than in the Sal, OV and SS treatments on day 7.

The TGF-β and IL-10 concentration was higher in the LE5 and LE10 treatment of the extract than in the Sal, OV and SS treatments on day 7. The ointment based on &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudoquina&lt;/i&gt; closed the wound faster and accelerated wound healing in animals.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006056</link><updated>1522098000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/OQUjBd7KMBU/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jonathan Schiefer</name></author><unread>False</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006056</originId><published>1522098000000</published><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006056</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>31</engagement><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><recrawled>1522095842894</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Schiefer, Alexander Niederbühl, Volker Pernice, Carolin Lennartz, Jürgen Hennig, Pierre LeVan, Stefan Rotter&lt;/p&gt;
Knowing brain connectivity is of great importance both in basic research and for clinical applications. We are proposing a method to infer directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances of neuronal activity recorded at multiple sites. This allows us to identify causal relations that are reflected in neuronal population activity. To derive our strategy, we assume a generic linear model of interacting continuous variables, the components of which represent the activity of local neuronal populations. The suggested method for inferring connectivity from recorded signals exploits the fact that the covariance matrix derived from the observed activity contains information about the existence, the direction and the sign of connections. Assuming a sparsely coupled network, we disambiguate the underlying causal structure via &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-minimization, which is known to prefer sparse solutions. In general, this method is suited to infer effective connectivity from resting state data of various types. We show that our method is applicable over a broad range of structural parameters regarding network size and connection probability of the network. We also explored parameters affecting its activity dynamics, like the eigenvalue spectrum. Also, based on the simulation of suitable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes to model BOLD dynamics, we show that with our method it is possible to estimate directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances derived from such signals. In this study, we consider measurement noise and unobserved nodes as additional confounding factors. Furthermore, we investigate the amount of data required for a reliable estimate. Additionally, we apply the proposed method on full-brain resting-state fast fMRI datasets. The resulting network exhibits a tendency for close-by areas being connected as well as inter-hemispheric connections between corresponding areas. In addition, we found that a surprisingly large fraction of more than one third of all identified connections were of inhibitory nature.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQUjBd7KMBU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1626369d765:13d2b8:a077e55f</id><title>From correlation to causation: Estimating effective connectivity from zero-lag covariances of brain signals</title><fingerprint>cc3e5fdc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Schiefer, Alexander Niederbühl, Volker Pernice, Carolin Lennartz, Jürgen Hennig, Pierre LeVan, Stefan Rotter&lt;/p&gt;

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a prevalent method for gene expression analysis, depending on the stability of the reference genes for data normalization. &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia indica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;speciosa&lt;/i&gt; are popular ornamental plants which are famous for the long flowering period. However, no systematic studies on reference genes in &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia&lt;/i&gt; have yet been conducted. In the present study, we selected nine candidate reference genes (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TUA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TUB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;18S&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RPII&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EF-1α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATC&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EIF5A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) and evaluated their expression stability in different tissues during floral development of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;indica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;speciosa&lt;/i&gt; using four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and, RefFinder).

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products contain various amounts of dimeric IgG complexes. Current insights into the possible biological activities of these dimers remain controversial, and both immunemodulating and immune-activating effects have been reported. Here, we analyzed the putative immune-activating effects of dimers isolated from IVIg.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Dimers isolated from IVIg were purified by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) and tested for the ability to induce neutrophil degranulation in vitro.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Dimers isolated from IVIg were found to be incapable of inducing in vitro neutrophil degranulation or complement activation, even at concentrations exceeding those expected to be reached upon administration in patients. These results depend on the removal of artefactual activation by using 0.1 micron filtration and the use of poloxamer to prevent adsorption of IgG onto the solid phase.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The data suggest dimeric IgG found in IVIg may bind to Fc-receptors without causing activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c2:9aea0a7d</id><title>Dimeric IgG complexes from IVIg are incapable of inducing &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; neutrophil degranulation or complement activation</title><fingerprint>99668730</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Iwan Kustiawan, Ninotska I.

Although significant attention has been devoted to analyzing stigma associated with epilepsy, there is still a significant lack of valid and reliable instruments. We aimed to validate the 23-item Czech version of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE; originally developed in Brazil), which has been used to evaluate epilepsy-related stigma in the general population. Verification of the SSE questionnaire was carried out in a group of 207 students aged 15–18 years of whom none had epilepsy. These students completed the SSE twice in a period of 3–6 months as part of standard test-retest evaluation practice. The instrument exhibits good psychometric properties including internal consistency higher than in the original version (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.856 here compared with 0.81 reported in Brazil) and acceptable test-retest reliability. Using exploratory factor analysis (not provided for the original version), four factors were identified and corresponding subscales were described and interpreted. Two items did not fit into the structure and were eliminated. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to propose and verify the hierarchical 4-factor structure of the Czech version of SSE confirming the existence of a common factor corresponding to stigma. The results showed that the Czech version of SSE has good psychometric properties and can be used in further research and clinical practice.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde2b:9f3b30f2</id><title>Psychometric properties of the Czech version of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy</title><fingerprint>a2b21182</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dana Brabcová, Jiří Kohout, Daniel Potužák, Barbora Beňová, Pavel Kršek&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Musculoskeletal complaints and injuries (MSCI) are common in military populations. However, only a limited number of studies have followed soldiers during international deployments and investigated the prevalence of MSCI during and at the end of their deployment. The aim was to describe the prevalence of MSCI in different military occupational specialties and categorise their most common tasks in terms of exposures to physical workloads during a six-month long international deployment in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey, including 325 soldiers (300 men), aged 20–62 participating in an international deployment in Afghanistan during the spring of 2012. Soldiers were clustered into different military occupational specialties: Infantry, Administration, Logistics, Logistics/Camp, Medical and Other. Data were collected through the use of the Musculoskeletal Screening Protocol at the end of the international mission.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven percent reported MSCI during deployment, with 28% at the end.The most common locations of MSCI during the mission were lower back, knee, shoulders, upper back, neck and foot, while the knee and lower back prevailed at the end of the mission. Almost half of the soldiers who had MSCI reported affected work ability. The most common duties during the mission were vehicle patrolling, staff duties, guard/security duties, foot patrols and transportation. Soldiers reported that vehicle patrolling, staff duties and transportation were demanding with respect to endurance strength, guard/security duties challenged both maximum and endurance strength while foot patrolling challenged maximum and endurance strength, aerobic and anaerobic endurance and speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MSCI during international deployment are common among Swedish soldiers. The results indicate the need to further develop strategies focusing on matching the soldiers’ capacity to the job requirements, with relevant and fair physical selection-tests during the recruitment process and proactive interventions targeting MSCI before and during deployment, in order to enhance soldiers’ readiness and promote operational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73f:9f3b30f2</id><title>Self-reported musculoskeletal complaints and injuries and exposure of physical workload in Swedish soldiers serving in Afghanistan</title><fingerprint>2ae4a2de</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandra Halvarsson, Ingela Hagman, Matthias Tegern, Lisbet Broman, Helena Larsson&lt;/p&gt;

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing architectures with many interconnections of simple neural-inspired computing elements, and have been applied to biomedical fields such as imaging analysis and diagnosis. We have developed a new ANN framework called Cox-nnet to predict patient prognosis from high throughput transcriptomics data. In 10 TCGA RNA-Seq data sets, Cox-nnet achieves the same or better predictive accuracy compared to other methods, including Cox-proportional hazards regression (with LASSO, ridge, and mimimax concave penalty), Random Forests Survival and CoxBoost. Cox-nnet also reveals richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels. The outputs from the hidden layer node provide an alternative approach for survival-sensitive dimension reduction. In summary, we have developed a new method for accurate and efficient prognosis prediction on high throughput data, with functional biological insights.

Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive nucleotide sequences that make up a large portion of eukaryotic genomes. They can move and duplicate within a genome, increasing genome size and contributing to genetic diversity within and across species. Accurate identification and classification of TEs present in a genome is an important step towards understanding their effects on genes and their role in genome evolution. We introduce TE-Learner, a framework based on machine learning that automatically identifies TEs in a given genome and assigns a classification to them. We present an implementation of our framework towards LTR retrotransposons, a particular type of TEs characterized by having long terminal repeats (LTRs) at their boundaries. We evaluate the predictive performance of our framework on the well-annotated genomes of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and we compare our results for three LTR retrotransposon superfamilies with the results of three widely used methods for TE identification or classification: RepeatMasker, Censor and LtrDigest. In contrast to these methods, TE-Learner is the first to incorporate machine learning techniques, outperforming these methods in terms of predictive performance, while able to learn models and make predictions efficiently. Moreover, we show that our method was able to identify TEs that none of the above method could find, and we investigated TE-Learner’s predictions which did not correspond to an official annotation. It turns out that many of these predictions are in fact strongly homologous to a known TE.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WmOp0oT-h9c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162f3a6e287:392b8:a077e55f</id><title>A machine learning based framework to identify and classify long terminal repeat retrotransposons</title><fingerprint>fa317272</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leander Schietgat, Celine Vens, Ricardo Cerri, Carlos N.

Background &lt;p&gt;Linkage to and retention in care for US persons living with HIV (PLWH) after release from jail usually declines. We know of no rigorously evaluated behavioral interventions that can improve this. We hypothesized that a strengths-based case management intervention that we developed for PLWH leaving jail would increase linkage/retention in care (indicated by receipt of laboratory draws) and a suppressed HIV viral load (VL) in the year following release.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We conducted a quasi-experimental feasibility study of our intervention for PLWH jailed in Atlanta. We recruited 113 PLWH in jail starting in 2014. “SUCCESS” (Sustained, Unbroken Connection to Care, Entry Services, and Suppression) began in jail and continued post-release. Subjects who started the intervention but subsequently began long-term incarcerations were excluded from further analysis. Persons who were retained in the intervention group were compared to contemporaneously incarcerated PLWH who did not receive the intervention. Identities were submitted to an enhanced HIV/AIDS reporting system (eHARS) at the state health department to capture all laboratories drawn. Both community engagement and care upon jail return were assessed equally. For 44 intervention participants released to Atlanta, 50% of care occurred on subsequent jail stays, as documented with EventFlow software. Forty-five receiving usual services only were recruited for comparison. By examining records of jail reentries, half of participants and 60% of controls recidivated (range: 1–8 returns). All but 6 participants in the intervention and 9 subjects in the comparison arm had ≥1 laboratory recorded in eHARS post-release. Among the intervention group, 52% were retained in care (i.e., had two laboratory studies, &gt; = 3 months apart), versus 40% among the comparison group (OR = 1.60, 95% CI (0.71, 3.81)). Both arms showed improved viral load suppression.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a trend towards increased retention for PLWH released from jail after SUCCESS, compared to usual services.

Background &lt;p&gt;Linkage to and retention in care for US persons living with HIV (PLWH) after release from jail usually declines. We know of no rigorously evaluated behavioral interventions that can improve this. We hypothesized that a strengths-based case management intervention that we developed for PLWH leaving jail would increase linkage/retention in care (indicated by receipt of laboratory draws) and a suppressed HIV viral load (VL) in the year following release.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We conducted a quasi-experimental feasibility study of our intervention for PLWH jailed in Atlanta. We recruited 113 PLWH in jail starting in 2014. “SUCCESS” (Sustained, Unbroken Connection to Care, Entry Services, and Suppression) began in jail and continued post-release. Subjects who started the intervention but subsequently began long-term incarcerations were excluded from further analysis.

Commercial hunting for the international trade in animal hides in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century decimated many populations of aquatic wildlife in Amazonia. However, impacts varied significantly between different species and regions, depending upon hunting intensity, accessibility of habitat, and the inherent resilience of various species and their habitats. We investigated the differential responses of two Amazonian Mustelid species, the neotropical otter and giant otter, to commercial hunting pressure along the upper Rio Negro in Brazil, and examined historical factors that influenced spatial and temporal variation in commercial exploitation. We analyzed previously unanalyzed data from historical records of hide shipments to track changes in hide sales and prices for the two species in the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. We also gathered oral histories from older Baniwa people who had witnessed or participated in commercial otter hunting. These complimentary data sources reveal how intrinsic biological and social characteristics of the two otter species interacted with market forces and regional history. Whereas giant otter populations were driven to local or regional extinction during the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century by commercial hunting, neotropical otters persisted. In recent decades, giant otter populations have returned to some parts of the upper Rio Negro, a development which local people welcome as part of a generalized recovery of the ecosystems in their territory as a result of the banning of animal pelt exports and indigenous land demarcation. This paper expands the scope of the field historical ecology and reflects on the role of local knowledge in biodiversity conservation.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c43:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Differential resilience of Amazonian otters along the Rio Negro in the aftermath of the 20&amp;lt;sup&gt;th&amp;lt;/sup&gt; century international fur trade</title><fingerprint>29f67cee</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Natalia C.

Haploid laboratory strains of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; are commonly used for genetic engineering to enable their xylose utilization but little is known about the industrial yeast which is often recognized as diploid and as well as haploid and tetraploid. Here we report three unique signature pathway expression patterns and gene interactions in the centre metabolic pathways that signify xylose utilization of genetically engineered industrial yeast &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; NRRL Y-50463, a diploid yeast. Quantitative expression analysis revealed outstanding high levels of constitutive expression of &lt;i&gt;YXI&lt;/i&gt;, a synthesized yeast codon-optimized xylose isomerase gene integrated into chromosome XV of strain Y-50463. Comparative expression analysis indicated that the &lt;i&gt;YXI&lt;/i&gt; was necessary to initiate the xylose metabolic pathway along with a set of heterologous xylose transporter and utilization facilitating genes including &lt;i&gt;XUT4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;XUT6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;XKS1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;XYL2&lt;/i&gt;. The highly activated transketolase and transaldolase genes &lt;i&gt;TKL1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TKL2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TAL1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;NQM1&lt;/i&gt; as well as their complex interactions in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway branch were critical for the serial of sugar transformation to drive the metabolic flow into glycolysis for increased ethanol production. The significantly increased expression of the entire &lt;i&gt;PRS&lt;/i&gt; gene family facilitates functions of the life cycle and biosynthesis superpathway for the yeast. The outstanding higher levels of constitutive expression of &lt;i&gt;YXI&lt;/i&gt; and the first insight into the signature pathway expression and the gene interactions in the closely related centre metabolic pathways from the industrial yeast aid continued efforts for development of the next-generation biocatalyst.

The aim of this study was to compare the axial lengths (ALs) using a new biometer with swept-source optical coherence tomography (Argos) versus ALs using a conventional biometer with partial coherence interferometry (IOL Master, version 5). The ALs in 48 eyes of 48 cataract patients were measured with Argos using refractive indexes that correspond to the particular tissue and with IOL Master using a single refractive index. The eyes were divided into three subgroups by AL length: short-AL group (n = 16), &amp;lt;23.27 mm; intermediate-AL group (n = 16), 23.27–24.03 mm; long-AL group (n = 16), ≥24.04 mm. The ALs (mm) measured with the Argos and IOL Master biometers, respectively, were 22.77 ± 0.43 and 22.74 ± 0.44, 23.63 ± 0.21 and 23.62 ± 0.21, and 26.00 ± 1.61 and 26.05 ± 1.64 in the short-, intermediate-, and long-AL groups, respectively. The mean ALs with the Argos biometer were longer than those with the IOL Master biometer in the short-AL group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) There was no significant difference in the intermediate-AL groups (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.14). In contrast, the mean ALs with the Argos biometer were shorter than those with the IOL Master biometer in the long-AL group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Differences between the ALs measured with the two biometers were statistically significant in short- and long-AL subgroups. However, the differences might not be clinically significant.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb4:34f43e70</id><title>Comparison of a new biometer using swept-source optical coherence tomography and a conventional biometer using partial coherence interferometry</title><fingerprint>a439b709</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoaki Higashiyama, Hazuki Mori, Fumi Nakajima, Masahito Ohji&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a live, viral vaccine under advanced development as a non-replicating smallpox vaccine. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial was conducted to demonstrate the humoral immunogenic equivalence of three consecutively manufactured MVA production lots, and to confirm the safety and tolerability of MVA focusing on cardiac readouts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The trial was conducted at 34 sites in the US. Vaccinia-naïve adults aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to one of four groups using a 1:1:1:1 randomization scheme. Subjects received either two MVA injections from three consecutive lots (Groups 1-3), or two placebo injections (Group 4), four weeks apart. Everyone except personnel involved in vaccine handling and administration was blinded to treatment. Safety assessment focused on cardiac monitoring throughout the trial. Vaccinia-specific antibody titers were measured using a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The primary immunogenicity endpoint was Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) after two MVA vaccinations measured by PRNT at trial visit 4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01144637.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 2013 and May 2014, 4005 subjects were enrolled and received at least one injection of MVA (n = 3003) or placebo (n = 1002). The three MVA lots induced equivalent antibody titers two weeks after the second vaccination, with seroconversion rates of 99·8% (PRNT) and 99·7% (ELISA). Overall, 180 (6·0%) subjects receiving MVA and 29 (2·9%) subjects in the placebo group reported at least one unsolicited Adverse Event (AE) that was considered trial-related. Vaccination was well tolerated without significant safety concerns, particularly regarding cardiac assessment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The neutralizing and total antibody titers induced by each of the three lots were equivalent. No significant safety concerns emerged in this healthy trial population, especially regarding cardiac safety, thus confirming the excellent safety and tolerability profile of MVA.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01144637&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793636:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Immunogenicity and safety of three consecutive production lots of the non replicating smallpox vaccine MVA: A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled phase III trial</title><fingerprint>49f44515</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Edgar Turner Overton, Steven J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Heavy burden of child injuries and lack of policy response in Ethiopia call for an improved understanding of the situation and development of action plans from multiple governmental agencies and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A consortium of international and Ethiopian researchers and stakeholders used extensive literature review and mixed analytical methods to estimate and project the burden of fatal and non-fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia from 2015 to 2030. Estimates were derived for children aged 0–14 years. Data sources include a longitudinal study conducted by the Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia and the World Bank as well as model-based estimates from World Health Organization 2017 and Global Burden of Disease 2016 project.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Injuries caused about 25 thousand deaths among 0-14-year olds in Ethiopia in 2015. The leading cause of fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia was road-traffic injuries, followed by fire, heat and hot substances and drowning. The death rate due to injuries among 0–14 years olds was about 50 percent higher in males than females. Rural children were exposed to a greater risk of injury than their urban peers. The longitudinal survey suggests that the incidence rate of child injuries increased during the period 2011–2014. The annual mortality caused by injuries is projected to increase from 10,697 in 2015 to 11,279 in 2020 and 11,989 in 2030 among children under 5 years, an increase of 12 percentage points in 15 years. The number of deaths among 0-14-year olds will be 26,463, 27,807, and 30,364 respectively in 2015, 2020, and 2030.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;As the first multisectoral collaboration on child injuries in Ethiopia, this study identified gaps in understanding of the burden of child injuries in Ethiopia. In consultation with Ethiopian government and other stakeholders, we propose starting an injury surveillance system at health clinics and hospitals and building an intervention package based on existing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f08:9f3b30f2</id><title>Child injuries in Ethiopia: A review of the current situation with projections</title><fingerprint>6d69379</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qingfeng Li, Olakunle Alonge, Collene Lawhorn, Yirga Ambaw, Smita Kumar, Troy Jacobs, Adnan A.

In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of repeated brain metastases (BM) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS2) following local failure of a prior radiosurgical procedure (SRS1). Between December 1996 and August 2015, 30 patients with 36 BM underwent SRS2 with a median dose of 18Gy. All BM were located outside critical structures. Following SRS2, local control at 6 months and one year were respectively 82.9% (IC 95%: 67.6–91.9) and 67.8% (IC 95%: 51–81). On multivariate analysis, planning target volume (PTV) &amp;lt; 3cc (HR: 0.19 (0.1–0.52)) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) prior to SRS2 (HR: 0.25 (0.1–0.64)) were significantly associated with a better local control. One- and two-year overall survival rates after SRS2 were respectively 65.5% (IC 95%: 47.3–80%) and 27.6% (IC 95%: 14.7–45.7). Median overall survival following SRS2 was 14.2 months (range 1–106). Nineteen (63%) patients died from progressive systemic disease. Three (10%) patients died from out-field progressive brain disease and 8 (27%) in-field. Concerning toxicities, edema, radionecrosis, and hemorrhages were identified in 5 (12.8%), 4 (10.2%), and 5 (12.8%) patients respectively. No toxicity resulted in a neurological deficit. On univariate analysis, toxicities were significantly associated with PTV &gt; 7cc (p = 0.02) and all patients had a WBRT before SRS2. A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases showed encouraging rates of local control. This treatment led to acceptable toxicities, especially for brain metastases smaller than 7cc, in our selected cohort of patients with BM located outside critical structures. Further studies are needed.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d745:9f3b30f2</id><title>Second course of stereotactic radiosurgery for locally recurrent brain metastases: Safety and efficacy</title><fingerprint>eb5b022d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juliette Moreau, Toufic Khalil, Guillaume Dupic, Emmanuel Chautard, Jean-Jacques Lemaire, Florian Magnier, Véronique Dedieu, Michel Lapeyre, Pierre Verrelle, Julian Biau&lt;/p&gt;

On univariate analysis, toxicities were significantly associated with PTV &gt; 7cc (p = 0.02) and all patients had a WBRT before SRS2. A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases showed encouraging rates of local control. This treatment led to acceptable toxicities, especially for brain metastases smaller than 7cc, in our selected cohort of patients with BM located outside critical structures. Further studies are needed.</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3800.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3800.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3800.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/15/3800/F1.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>295</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3800</canonicalUrl><author><name>Graham M.

TDP-43 is an ubiquitous and highly conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in several cellular processes including pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, mRNA stability and transport. Notwithstanding the evidence of TDP-43 involvement in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative disorders (i.e. ALS and FTLD), the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Given the high degree of functional similarity between the human and fly orthologs of TDP-43, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; is a simple and useful model to study the pathophysiological role of this protein &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. It has been demonstrated that the depletion of the TDP-43 fly ortholog (tbph) induces deficient locomotive behaviors and reduces life span and anatomical defects at the neuromuscular junction. In this study, using the known binding specificity of TDP-43/tbph for (UG) repeated sequences, we performed a bioinformatic screening for fly genes with at least 6 (TG) repeats in a row within the 3&apos;-UTR regions in order to identify the genes that might be regulated by this factor. Among these genes, we were able to identify RhoGAPp190 as a potential target of the tbph-mediated neurodegeneration. RhoGAPp190 is a negative regulator of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; RhoA, a GTPase protein implicated in the fine modulation of critical cellular processes including axon branch stability and motor axon defasciculation at muscle level and cognitive processes. We were able to demonstrate that the RhoGAPp190 expression is upregulated in a tbph-null fly model, providing evidence that this deregulation is associated to tbph silencing. Our results introduce RhoGAPp190 as a novel potential mediator in the complex scenario of events resulting from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tbph loss-of-function.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793632:7d6c1c1c</id><title>RhoGAPp190: A potential player in tbph-mediated neurodegeneration in &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>886166b2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Simona Langellotti, Giulia Romano, Fabian Feiguin, Francisco Ernesto Baralle, Maurizio Romano&lt;/p&gt;

We sought to identify biomarkers which delineated individual hypertrophic responses to resistance training. Untrained, college-aged males engaged in full-body resistance training (3 d/wk) for 12 weeks. Body composition via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL) thickness via ultrasound, blood, VL muscle biopsies, and three-repetition maximum (3-RM) squat strength were obtained prior to (PRE) and following (POST) 12 weeks of training. K-means cluster analysis based on VL thickness changes identified LOW [n = 17; change (mean±SD) = +0.11±0.14 cm], modest (MOD; n = 29, +0.40±0.06 cm), and high (HI; n = 21, +0.69±0.14 cm) responders. Biomarkers related to histology, ribosome biogenesis, proteolysis, inflammation, and androgen signaling were analyzed between clusters. There were main effects of time (POST&gt;PRE, p&amp;lt;0.05) but no cluster×time interactions for increases in DXA lean body mass, type I and II muscle fiber cross sectional area and myonuclear number, satellite cell number, and macronutrients consumed. Interestingly, PRE VL thickness was ~12% greater in LOW versus HI (p = 0.021), despite POST values being ~12% greater in HI versus LOW (p = 0.006). However there was only a weak correlation between PRE VL thickness scores and change in VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.114, p = 0.005). Forced post hoc analysis indicated that muscle total RNA levels (i.e., ribosome density) did not significantly increase in the LOW cluster (351±70 ng/mg to 380±62, p = 0.253), but increased in the MOD (369±115 to 429±92, p = 0.009) and HI clusters (356±77 to 470±134, p&amp;lt;0.001; POST HI&gt;POST LOW, p = 0.013). Nonetheless, there was only a weak association between change in muscle total RNA and VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.079, p = 0.026). IL-1β mRNA levels decreased in the MOD and HI clusters following training (p&amp;lt;0.05), although associations between this marker and VL thickness changes were not significant (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0002, p = 0.919). In conclusion, individuals with lower pre-training VL thickness values and greater increases muscle total RNA levels following 12 weeks of resistance training experienced greater VL muscle growth, although these biomarkers individually explained only ~8–11% of the variance in hypertrophy.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4603:34f43e70</id><title>Biomarkers associated with low, moderate, and high vastus lateralis muscle hypertrophy following 12 weeks of resistance training</title><fingerprint>f801a9ee</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher B.

The sodium-independent cystine-glutamate antiporter plays an important role in extracellular cystine uptake. It comprises the transmembrane protein, xCT and its chaperone, CD98. Because glutathione is only weakly cell membrane permeable, cellular uptake of its precursor, cystine, is known to be a key step in glutathione synthesis. Moreover, it has been reported that xCT expression affects the progression of tumors and their resistance to therapy. Sulfasalazine is an inhibitor of xCT that is known to increase cellular oxidative stress, giving it anti-tumor potential. Here, we describe a radio-sensitizing effect of sulfasalazine using a B16F10 melanoma model. Sulfasalazine decreased glutathione concentrations and resistance to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in B16F10 melanoma cells, but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. It synergistically enhanced the cyto-killing effect of X-irradiation in B16F10 cells. It inhibited cellular DNA damage repair and prolonged cell cycle arrest after X-irradiation. Furthermore, in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; transplanted melanoma model, sulfasalazine decreased intratumoral glutathione content, leading to enhanced susceptibility to radiation therapy. These results suggest the possibility of using SAS to augment the treatment of radio-resistant cancers.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc713b:34f43e70</id><title>Sulfasalazine, an inhibitor of the cystine-glutamate antiporter, reduces DNA damage repair and enhances radiosensitivity in murine B16F10 melanoma</title><fingerprint>1aa12fc1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masaki Nagane, Eiichi Kanai, Yuki Shibata, Takuto Shimizu, Chie Yoshioka, Takuya Maruo, Tadashi Yamashita&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Loss to care is high among asymptomatic HIV-infected women initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. However, whether pregnancy itself plays a role in the high loss to care rate is uncertain. We compared loss to care over seven years between pregnant and non-pregnant women at enrollment into HIV care in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective analysis of all ART-naive women aged 15–45 initiating HIV care at two large clinics in Kinshasa, DRC, from 2007–2013. Pregnancy status was recorded at care enrollment. Patients were classified as having no follow-up if they did not return to care after the initial enrollment visit. Among those with at least one follow-up visit after enrollment, we classified patients as lost to care if more than 365 days had passed since their last clinic visit. We used logistic regression to model the association between pregnancy status and no follow-up, and Cox proportional hazards regression to model the association between pregnancy status and time to loss to care.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2175 women included in the analysis, 1497 (68.8%) were pregnant at enrollment. Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were less likely to be over 35 years of age (19.1% vs. 31.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and less likely to be in WHO stage III or IV (9.0% vs. 26.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Among pregnant women, 106 (7.1%) were not seen after enrollment, versus 25 (3.7%) non-pregnant women (adjusted odds ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.24–3.24). Of the 2,044 women with at least one follow-up visit, 46.5% of pregnant women and 46.7% of non-pregnant women were lost to care by 5 years; hazards of loss to care were similar for pregnant and non-pregnant women (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.93–1.26).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this large cohort of HIV-infected women, patients pregnant at care enrollment were more likely to never return for follow-up. Among those who attended at least one follow-up visit, loss to care was not different between pregnant and non-pregnant women, suggesting that pregnancy itself may not be the main driver of the high attrition observed in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7692f:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Association between pregnancy at enrollment into HIV care and loss to care among women in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2006-2013</title><fingerprint>e9c8c069</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Ross, Andrew Edmonds, Donald R.

Among those who attended at least one follow-up visit, loss to care was not different between pregnant and non-pregnant women, suggesting that pregnancy itself may not be the main driver of the high attrition observed in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195874</link><updated>1523566800000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195874</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Fábio de Azevedo Silva</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195874</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195874</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1523566800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fábio de Azevedo Silva, Rhavena Graziela Liotti, Ana Paula de Araújo Boleti, Érica de Melo Reis, Marilene Borges Silva Passos, Edson Lucas dos Santos, Olivia Moreira Sampaio, Ana Helena Januário, Carmen Lucia Bassi Branco, Gilvan Ferreira da Silva, Elisabeth Aparecida Furtado de Mendonça, Marcos Antônio Soares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Paullinia cupana&lt;/i&gt; is associated with a diverse community of pathogenic and endophytic microorganisms.

We found that -catenin palmitoylation is also instrumental in the development of neuropathic pain. The abundances of palmitoylated -catenin and the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC3 were increased in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons in rat models of neuropathic pain. Inhibiting palmitoyl acyltransferases or decreasing -catenin abundance in the DRG by intrathecal injection of 2-bromopalmitate or shRNA, respectively, alleviated oxaliplatin or nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain in the rats. The palmitoylation of -catenin, which was induced by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, facilitated its interaction with the voltage-gated sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 and the kinesin motor protein KIF3A, which promoted the trafficking of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 to the plasma membrane in DRG neurons and contributed to mechanical hypersensitivity and allodynia in rats. These findings suggest that a palmitoylation-mediated KIF3A/-catenin/Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 complex enhances the transmission of mechanical and nociceptive signals; thus, blocking this mechanism may be therapeutic in patients with neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>RuJRIXzN26JgDGk9YhlIBfh4YrPi0r+1c4exm9G1IBw=_16268b24d05:62ff818:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Palmitoylation of {delta}-catenin promotes kinesin-mediated membrane trafficking of Nav1.6 in sensory neurons to promote neuropathic pain</title><fingerprint>3161279e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;Palmitoylation of -catenin is critical to synapse plasticity and memory formation.

The cutaneous silent period is an inhibitory evoked response that demonstrates a wide variety of responses in muscles of the human upper limb. Classically, the cutaneous silent period results in a characteristic muscle pattern of extensor inhibition and flexor facilitation within the upper limb, in the presence of nociceptive input. The aims of the current study were: 1) to primarily investigate the presence and characteristics of the cutaneous silent period response across multiple extensor and flexor muscles of the upper limb, and 2) to secondarily investigate the influence of stimulation site on this nociceptive reflex response. It was hypothesized that the cutaneous silent period would be present in all muscles, regardless of role (flexion/extension) or the stimulation site. Twenty-two healthy, university-age adults (14 males; 8 females; 23 ± 5 yrs) participated in the study. Testing consisted of three different stimulation sites (Digit II, V, and II+III nociceptive stimulation) during a low intensity, sustained muscle contraction, in which, 7 upper limb muscles were monitored via surface EMG recording electrodes. Distal muscles of the upper limb presented with the earliest reflex onset times, longest reflex duration, and lowest level of EMG suppression when compared to the more proximal muscles, regardless of extensor/flexor role. Additionally, the greatest overall inhibitory influence was expressed within the distal muscles. In conclusion, the present study provides a new level of refinement within the current understanding of the spinal organization associated with nociceptive input processing and the associated motor control of the upper limb. Subsequently, these results have further implications on the impact of nociception on supraspinal processing.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b2:91749e5b</id><title>Differential processing of nociceptive input within upper limb muscles</title><fingerprint>e7139302</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathanial R.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the photochemical degradation of trypan blue (TB) and to identify decomposition products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Defined solution samples of TB and a mixture with lutein/zeaxanthin were exposed to blue light. Thermal degradation processes were ruled out using controls not subjected to irradiation. All samples were analyzed using optical microscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Degradation kinetics were determined based on changes in absorbance; intermediates were identified by analyzing mass differences of characteristic fragment ion peaks within the fragmentation patterns, and assignments were verified by NMR.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photochemical degradation, which can be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin. Intermediates vary depending on the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin. The self-sensitized photodegradation of TB occurs under generation of dimethyl sulfate and presumed formation of phenol. In contrast, within the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin the decomposition of TB indicates the formation of methoxyamine and sulfonyl arin. Thermal degradation processes were not observed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photodegradation that may be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin and results in the formation of cytotoxic decomposition products. Our findings contribute to understand degradation mechanisms of TB and may elucidate previous clinical and experimental observations of cellular toxicity after TB application.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c8:9aea0a7d</id><title>Photochemical degradation of trypan blue</title><fingerprint>711b2088</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias Brockmann, Véronique Blanchard, Philipp Heretsch, Claudia Brockmann, Eckart Bertelmann&lt;/p&gt;

Urinary type IV collagen (U-Col4) and albumin excretion is evaluated to monitor the development of diabetic kidney disease. However, U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, 1067 participants without diabetes and with urinary albumin-creatinine ratio &amp;lt;300 mg/gCr (normo- or microalbuminuria) who underwent an annual health examination in 2004 were enrolled and observed for 5 years. They were divided according to the amount of U-Col4 or urinary albumin excreted. The decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated. In participants with eGFR ≥80 mL/min, abnormal U-Col4 excretion was indicated as a significant independent risk factor for 10% eGFR change per year, which is one of the prognostic factors for the development of end-stage kidney disease. Moreover, in contrast to urinary albumin excretion, U-Col4 excretion was not related to age or kidney function, suggesting that some individuals with abnormal U-Col4 excretion can have an independent hidden risk for the development of kidney dysfunction. In conclusion, it is important to measure U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes to determine changes in renal features in every individual and help detect future complications such as diabetic kidney disease. If U-Col4 excretion is abnormal, kidney manifestation should be carefully followed up, even if the kidney function and urinalysis findings are normal.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd081:7c9981b6</id><title>Urinary type IV collagen excretion is involved in the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate in the Japanese general population without diabetes: A 5-year observational study</title><fingerprint>a4d1fbb0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fumi Kishi, Kojiro Nagai, Norimichi Takamatsu, Tatsuya Tominaga, Masanori Tamaki, Eriko Shibata, Taichi Murakami, Seiji Kishi, Hideharu Abe, Yasuhiko Koezuka, Naoto Minagawa, Go Ichien, Toshio Doi&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; cell lineage is nearly invariant. Whether this stereotyped cell-division pattern promotes reproducibility in cell shapes/positions is not generally known, as manual spatiotemporal cell-shape/position alignments are labor-intensive, and fully-automated methods are not described. Here, we report automated algorithms for spatiotemporal alignments of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryos from pre-morphogenesis to motor-activity initiation. We use sparsely-labeled green-fluorescent nuclei and a pan-nuclear red-fluorescent reporter to register consecutive imaging time points and compare embryos. Using our method, we monitor early assembly of the nerve-ring (NR) brain neuropil. While NR pioneer neurons exhibit reproducible growth kinetics and axon positions, cell-body placements are variable. Thus, pioneer-neuron axon locations, but not cell-body positions, are under selection. We also show that anterior NR displacement in &lt;i&gt;cam-1&lt;/i&gt;/ROR Wnt-receptor mutants is not an early NR assembly defect. Our results demonstrate the utility of automated spatiotemporal alignments of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryos, and uncover key principles guiding nervous-system development in this animal.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4244:9f3b30f2</id><title>Automated &amp;lt;i&gt;C&amp;lt;/i&gt;. &amp;lt;i&gt;elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; embryo alignments reveal brain neuropil position invariance despite lax cell body placement</title><fingerprint>30642d54</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Insley, Shai Shaham&lt;/p&gt;

Here, we report automated algorithms for spatiotemporal alignments of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryos from pre-morphogenesis to motor-activity initiation. We use sparsely-labeled green-fluorescent nuclei and a pan-nuclear red-fluorescent reporter to register consecutive imaging time points and compare embryos. Using our method, we monitor early assembly of the nerve-ring (NR) brain neuropil. While NR pioneer neurons exhibit reproducible growth kinetics and axon positions, cell-body placements are variable. Thus, pioneer-neuron axon locations, but not cell-body positions, are under selection. We also show that anterior NR displacement in &lt;i&gt;cam-1&lt;/i&gt;/ROR Wnt-receptor mutants is not an early NR assembly defect. Our results demonstrate the utility of automated spatiotemporal alignments of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryos, and uncover key principles guiding nervous-system development in this animal.</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3361.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3361.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3361.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/15/E3361/F1.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>188</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3361</canonicalUrl><author><name>Henning Piezunka, Wonjae Lee, Richard Haynes, Matthew S.

Enzymatic functionalization of cross-β structured protein nanofibrils has hitherto resulted in a severe reduction of the catalytic efficiency of high turnover biocatalysts. It has been speculated that steric restrictions and mass transport pose limits on the attached enzymes, but detailed kinetics analyzing this have not yet been reported. For a more comprehensive understanding, we studied protein nanofibrils endowed with TEM1, a β-lactamase from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. The packing density of TEM1 along the fibrils was controlled by co-fibrillation; in other words, the N-terminal ureidosuccinate transporter Ure2(1–80) from &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; was simultaneously aggregated with the chimeric proteins TEM1-Ure2(1–80). The mature fibrils were trapped in a column, and the rate of ampicillin hydrolysis was recorded using a continuous substrate flow. The turnover rate was plotted as a function of substrate molecules available per enzyme per second, which demonstrated that an elevated substrate availability counteracts mass transport limitations. To analyze this data set, we derived a kinetic model, which makes it possible to easily characterize and compare enzymes packed in columns. The functional TEM1 nanofibrils possess 80% of the catalytic turnover rate compared to free TEM1 in solution. Altogether, we have created protein nanofibrils that can effectively hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotic contaminations and provided a groundwork strategy for other highly functional enzymatic nanofibrils.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba0:7d6c1c1c</id><title>The kinetics of TEM1 antibiotic degrading enzymes that are displayed on Ure2 protein nanofibrils in a flow reactor</title><fingerprint>a589eec1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Schmuck, Mats Sandgren, Torleif Härd&lt;/p&gt;

As a consequence, we propose the hallmark signatures as a ground truth to characterise tails of infrequent genomic alterations and identify potential novel cancer driver genes and networks.</description></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302026v2?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302026v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302026v2?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/17/302026</canonicalUrl><author><name>Aun, E.</name></author><published>1523948400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523987370071</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>We have developed an easy-to-use and memory-efficient method called PhenotypeSeeker that (a) generates a k-mer-based statistical model for predicting a given phenotype and (b) predicts the phenotype from the sequencing data of a given bacterial isolate.

A widespread opinion is that conservation efforts disproportionately benefit charismatic species. However, this doesn’t mean that they are not threatened, and which species are “charismatic” remains unclear. Here, we identify the 10 most charismatic animals and show that they are at high risk of imminent extinction in the wild. We also find that the public ignores these animals’ predicament and we suggest it could be due to the observed biased perception of their abundance, based more on their profusion in our culture than on their natural populations. We hypothesize that this biased perception impairs conservation efforts because people are unaware that the animals they cherish face imminent extinction and do not perceive their urgent need for conservation. By freely using the image of rare and threatened species in their product marketing, many companies may participate in creating this biased perception, with unintended detrimental effects on conservation efforts, which should be compensated by channeling part of the associated profits to conservation. According to our hypothesis, this biased perception would be likely to last as long as the massive cultural and commercial presence of charismatic species is not accompanied by adequate information campaigns about the imminent threats they face.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Nro8ydzQjr8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162bafef6cd:c0b2ae:76251cdd</id><title>The paradoxical extinction of the most charismatic animals</title><fingerprint>d602cb88</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Franck Courchamp, Ivan Jaric, Céline Albert, Yves Meinard, William J.

High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been shown &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to impinge on telomere homeostasis in a number of ways. However, the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; interaction of viruses with the telomere homeostasis apparatus has not been previously explored. Since E6 and E7 are the main viral oncogenes and key for viral replication, we have explored here the short-term phenotypes of the genes in the context of defective telomere homeostasis. We examined the short-term phenotypes of E6 and E7 in a context where the Terc component of the telomerase holoenzyme was knocked out. We determined that Terc was dispensable for most oncogene-mediated phenotypes. Surprisingly, E7-mediated reduction of label retaining cells was found to be in part dependent on the presence of Terc. Under the conditions examined here, there appears to be no compelling evidence Terc is required for most short-term viral oncogene mediated phenotypes. Further studies will elucidate its role in longer-term phenotypes.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefba:11c251fd</id><title>Terc is dispensable for most of the short-term HPV16 oncogene-mediated phenotypes in mice</title><fingerprint>b7ff2789</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charis Achilleos, Stella Michael, Katerina Strati&lt;/p&gt;
