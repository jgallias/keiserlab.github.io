Background &lt;p&gt;This study explored spatial-temporal variation in diagnoses of gonorrhoea to identify and quantify endemic areas and clusters in relation to patient characteristics and outcomes of partner notification (PN) across England, UK.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Endemic areas and clusters were identified using a two-stage analysis with Kulldorff’s scan statistics (SaTScan).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2,571,838 tests, 53,547 diagnoses were gonorrhoea positive (positivity = 2.08%). The proportion of diagnoses in heterosexual males was 1.5 times that in heterosexual females. Among index cases, men who have sex with men (MSM) were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with gonorrhoea than heterosexual males (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity and deprivation rank, 4 endemic areas were identified including 11,047 diagnoses, 86% of which occurred in London. 33 clusters included 17,629 diagnoses (34% of total diagnoses in 2012 and 2013) and spanned 21 locations, some of which were dominated by heterosexually acquired infection, whilst others were MSM focused. Of the 53,547 diagnoses, 14.5% (7,775) were the result of PN. The proportion of patients who attended services as a result of PN varied from 0% to 61% within different age, gender and sexual orientation cohorts. A third of tests resulting from PN were positive for gonorrhoea. 25% of Local Authorities (n = 81, 95% CI: 20.2, 29.5) had a higher than expected proportion for female PN diagnoses as compared to 16% for males (n = 52, 95% CI: 12.0, 19.9).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The English gonorrhoea epidemic is characterised by spatial-temporal variation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several types of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) impair the physical and mental status. The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive ability of several cardiovascular biomarkers for identifying the incidence of disability as future recipients of public long-term care (LTC) service.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The subjects of this study were community-dwelling elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age without a history of CVD (n = 5,755; mean age, 71 years). The endpoint of this study was official certification as a recipient of LTC. The cohort was divided into quartiles (Qs) based on the levels of three CVD biomarkers: the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), plasma B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (BNP), and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration (hsCRP). A time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the multi-adjusted relative hazard ratios (HRs) for incident LTC among the quartiles of each biomarker.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the follow-up (mean 5.6 years), 710 subjects were authorized as recipients of LTC. The HR was only significantly increased in the higher Qs of UACR (Q3, p &amp;lt; 0.01; Q4, p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, other biomarkers were not significantly associated with the endpoint.

A sensitive and innovative assay system based on a micro-MEMS-fluxgate sensor and immunomagnetic beads-labels was developed for the rapid analysis of C-reactive proteins (CRP). The fluxgate sensor presented in this study was fabricated through standard micro-electro-mechanical system technology. A multi-loop magnetic core made of Fe-based amorphous ribbon was employed as the sensing element, and 3-D solenoid copper coils were used to control the sensing core. Antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic microbeads were strategically utilized as signal tags to label the CRP via the specific conjugation of CRP to polyclonal CRP antibodies. Separate Au film substrates were applied as immunoplatforms to immobilize CRP-beads labels through classical sandwich assays. Detection and quantification of the CRP at different concentrations were implemented by detecting the stray field of CRP labeled magnetic beads using the newly-developed micro-fluxgate sensor. The resulting system exhibited the required sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. A detection limit as low as 0.002 μg/mL CRP with a linearity range from 0.002 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL was achieved, and this suggested that the proposed biosystem possesses high sensitivity. In addition to the extremely low detection limit, the proposed method can be easily manipulated and possesses a quick response time.

A sensitive and innovative assay system based on a micro-MEMS-fluxgate sensor and immunomagnetic beads-labels was developed for the rapid analysis of C-reactive proteins (CRP). The fluxgate sensor presented in this study was fabricated through standard micro-electro-mechanical system technology. A multi-loop magnetic core made of Fe-based amorphous ribbon was employed as the sensing element, and 3-D solenoid copper coils were used to control the sensing core. Antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic microbeads were strategically utilized as signal tags to label the CRP via the specific conjugation of CRP to polyclonal CRP antibodies. Separate Au film substrates were applied as immunoplatforms to immobilize CRP-beads labels through classical sandwich assays. Detection and quantification of the CRP at different concentrations were implemented by detecting the stray field of CRP labeled magnetic beads using the newly-developed micro-fluxgate sensor. The resulting system exhibited the required sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. A detection limit as low as 0.002 μg/mL CRP with a linearity range from 0.002 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL was achieved, and this suggested that the proposed biosystem possesses high sensitivity. In addition to the extremely low detection limit, the proposed method can be easily manipulated and possesses a quick response time. The response time of our sensor was less than 5 s, and the entire detection period for CRP analysis can be completed in less than 30 min using the current method. Given the detection performance and other advantages such as miniaturization, excellent stability and specificity, the proposed biosensor can be considered as a potential candidate for the rapid analysis of CRP, especially for point-of-care platforms.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Assembly of the membrane domain of ATP synthase in human mitochondria [Biochemistry]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2988.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6d3:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2988</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2988.short?rss=1</originId><published>1521567125000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c3f6b923</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2988.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The ATP synthase in human mitochondria is a membrane-bound assembly of 29 proteins of 18 kinds.

Land managers increasingly rely upon landscape assessments to understand the status of natural resources and identify conservation priorities.

These general models utilize measures of habitat disturbance and human activity to map indices of ecological integrity.

Lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes (DM2) prevention implementation studies can be effective and lasting. Long-term weight loss maintenance enhances the intervention effect through a significant decrease in diabetes incidence over time. Our objective was to identify factors predicting long-term successful weight reduction maintenance achieved during a DM2 prevention program in patients with high DM2 risk in primary health care. Study participants (n = 263), middle-aged, slightly obese with baseline increased DM2 risk (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC)&gt;14), but no diabetes were invited to receive 11 lifestyle counselling sessions, guided physical activity sessions and motivational support during 10-months. The study participants had three clinical examinations during the study (baseline, one and three years). Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of weight reduction maintenance two years after the discontinuation of the intervention. Out of 105 patients who completed all three examinations (baseline age 56.6 (standard deviation (SD) = 10.7), body mass index 31.1 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (SD = 4.9), FINDRISC 18.6 (SD = 3.1)), 73 patients (70%) showed weight loss during the intervention (mean weight loss 4.2 kg, SD = 5.1). The total weight loss achieved in the maintainers (27 of 73 study participants) two years after the intervention had finished was 6.54 kg (4.47 kg+2.0 kg). The non-maintainers, on the other hand, returned to their initial weight at the start of the intervention (+0.21 kg). In multivariable analysis baseline history of increased glucose (odds ratio (OR) = 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–13.6) and reduction of total fat in diet during follow-up (OR = 4.3; 95% CI 1.5–12.2) were independent predictors of successful weight loss. Further studies exploring predictors of weight loss maintenance in diabetes prevention are needed to help health care providers to redesign interventions and improve long-term outcomes of real life interventions.</content></content><author><name>Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska</name></author><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska, Noël C.

In 2013, a large measles epidemic occurred in the Aketi Health Zone of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We conducted a two-stage, retrospective cluster survey to estimate the attack rate, the case fatality rate, and the measles-specific mortality rate during the epidemic. 1424 households containing 7880 individuals were included. The estimated attack rate was 14.0%, (35.0% among children aged &amp;lt;5years). The estimated case fatality rate was 4.2% (6.1% among children aged &amp;lt;5years). Spatial analysis and linear regression showed that younger children, those who did not receive care, and those living farther away from Aketi Hospital early in the epidemic had a higher risk of measles related death. Vaccination coverage prior to the outbreak was low (76%), and a delayed reactive vaccination campaign contributed to the high attack rate. We provide evidences suggesting that a comprehensive case management approach reduced measles fatality during this epidemic in rural, inaccessible resource-poor setting.</content></content><author><name>Etienne Gignoux</name></author><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Etienne Gignoux, Jonathan Polonsky, Iza Ciglenecki, Mathieu Bichet, Matthew Coldiron, Enoch Thuambe Lwiyo, Innocent Akonda, Micaela Serafini, Klaudia Porten&lt;/p&gt;

Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein specific for &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; and constitutes one of the three main protein antigens of the Bexsero vaccine. Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect. Moreover, we found that the C3-convertase of the alternative complement pathway is one of the proteases responsible for this processing. Overall, our data provide new insights on the cleavage of NHBA protein during meningococcal infection. NHBA cleavage may occur at different stages of the infection, and it likely has a different role depending on the environment the bacterium is interacting with.</content></content><author><name>Martina Di Fede</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Di Fede, Massimiliano Biagini, Elena Cartocci, Carlo Parillo, Alessandra Greco, Manuele Martinelli, Sara Marchi, Alfredo Pezzicoli, Isabel Delany, Silvia Rossi Paccani&lt;/p&gt;

Our implementation is the first practical step towards fulfilling the promise of graph genomes to radically enhance the scalability and precision of genomic analysis by incorporating prior knowledge of population characteristics.</description></item><item><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 12, Page i-i, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25210?af=R</link><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626593d80b:6ce27:76251cdd</id><unread>True</unread><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25210?af=R</originId><published>1522122610699</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e165575</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 12, Page i-i, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25210?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/1096987x/39/12&quot;&gt;Volume 39, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, Page i-i, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1522122610699</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Spatial variations of soil respiration and temperature sensitivity along a steep slope of the semiarid Loess Plateau</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195400</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd077:7c9981b6</id><updated>1523048400000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195400</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195400</originId><published>1523048400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>767ae66b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195400</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Qiqi Sun, Rui Wang, Yaxian Hu, Lunguang Yao, Shengli Guo&lt;/p&gt;
The spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity pose a great challenge to accurately estimate the carbon flux in global carbon cycling, which has primarily been researched in flatlands versus hillslope ecosystems. On an eroded slope (35°) of the semiarid Loess Plateau, soil respiration, soil moisture and soil temperature were measured &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; at upper and lower slope positions in triplicate from 2014 until 2016, and the soil biochemical and microbial properties were determined. The results showed that soil respiration was significantly greater (by 44.2%) at the lower slope position (2.6 μmol m&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;) than at the upper slope position, as were soil moisture, carbon, nitrogen fractions and root biomass. However, the temperature sensitivity was 13.2% greater at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The soil fungal community changed from being Basidiomycota-dominant at the upper slope position to being Zygomycota-dominant at the lower slope position, corresponding with increased β-D-glucosidase activity at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position. We concluded that soil respiration was enhanced by the greater soil moisture, root biomass, carbon and nitrogen contents at the lower slope position than at the upper slope position. Moreover, the increased soil respiration and decreased temperature sensitivity at the lower slope position were partially due to copiotrophs replacing oligotrophs. Such spatial variations along slopes must be properly accounted for when estimating the carbon budget and feedback of future climate change on hillslope ecosystems.</content></content><author><name>Qiqi Sun</name></author><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qiqi Sun, Rui Wang, Yaxian Hu, Lunguang Yao, Shengli Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Molecular characterization of early hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains rare. Ten out of 78 patients of a hematology/oncology center were found to be HCV RNA positive two to four months after hospitalization. Only two of the ten patients were anti-HCV positive. HCV hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) was amplified in seven patients (including one anti-HCV positive) and analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS). Genetic variants were reconstructed by Shorah and an empirically established 0.5% variant frequency cut-off was implemented. These sequences were compared by phylogenetic and diversity analyses. Ten unrelated blood donors with newly acquired HCV infection detected at the time of donation (HCV RNA positive and anti-HCV negative) served as controls. One to seven HVR1 variants were found in each patient. Sequences intermixed phylogenetically with no evidence of clustering in individual patients. These sequences were more similar to each other (similarity 95.4% to 100.0%) than to those of controls (similarity 64.8% to 82.6%). An identical predominant variant was present in four patients, whereas other closely related variants dominated in the remaining three patients. In five patients the HCV population was limited to a single variant or one predominant variant and minor variants of less than 10% frequency. In conclusion, NGS analysis of a cluster of HCV infections acquired in the hospital setting revealed the presence of low diversity, very closely related variants in all patients, suggesting an early-stage infection with the same virus. NGS combined with phylogenetic analysis and classical epidemiological analysis could help in tracking of HCV outbreaks.</content></content><author><name>Kamila Caraballo Cortes</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kamila Caraballo Cortes, Magdalena Rosińska, Maciej Janiak, Małgorzata Stępień, Osvaldo Zagordi, Karol Perlejewski, Sylwia Osuch, Agnieszka Pawełczyk, Iwona Bukowska-Ośko, Rafał Płoski, Piotr Grabarczyk, Tomasz Laskus, Marek Radkowski&lt;/p&gt;

We present a new educational initiative called Meet-U that aims to train students for collaborative work in computational biology and to bridge the gap between education and research. Meet-U mimics the setup of collaborative research projects and takes advantage of the most popular tools for collaborative work and of cloud computing. Students are grouped in teams of 4–5 people and have to realize a project from A to Z that answers a challenging question in biology. Meet-U promotes &amp;quot;coopetition,&amp;quot; as the students collaborate within and across the teams and are also in competition with each other to develop the best final product. Meet-U fosters interactions between different actors of education and research through the organization of a meeting day, open to everyone, where the students present their work to a jury of researchers and jury members give research seminars. This very unique combination of education and research is strongly motivating for the students and provides a formidable opportunity for a scientific community to unite and increase its visibility. We report on our experience with Meet-U in two French universities with master’s students in bioinformatics and modeling, with protein–protein docking as the subject of the course. Meet-U is easy to implement and can be straightforwardly transferred to other fields and/or universities.

We present a new educational initiative called Meet-U that aims to train students for collaborative work in computational biology and to bridge the gap between education and research. Meet-U mimics the setup of collaborative research projects and takes advantage of the most popular tools for collaborative work and of cloud computing. Students are grouped in teams of 4–5 people and have to realize a project from A to Z that answers a challenging question in biology. Meet-U promotes &amp;quot;coopetition,&amp;quot; as the students collaborate within and across the teams and are also in competition with each other to develop the best final product. Meet-U fosters interactions between different actors of education and research through the organization of a meeting day, open to everyone, where the students present their work to a jury of researchers and jury members give research seminars. This very unique combination of education and research is strongly motivating for the students and provides a formidable opportunity for a scientific community to unite and increase its visibility.

UroSEEK detected genetic abnormalities in 68% of urines obtained from BC patients under surveillance who demonstrated clinical evidence of recurrence. The advantages of UroSEEK over cytology were evident in low-grade BCs; UroSEEK detected 67% of cases whereas cytology detected none. These results establish the foundation for a new non-invasive approach for detection of urothelial cancer.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03859-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Entropy favors heterogeneous structures of networks near the rigidity threshold</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03859-9</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162aed0934a:1c002b8:7c9981b6</id><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03859-9</originId><published>1523343600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e28f6f72</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/CsKK2q_iJVo/s41467-018-03859-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entropy favors heterogeneous structures of networks near the rigidity threshold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entropy favors heterogeneous structures of networks near the rigidity threshold, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03859-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03859-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The mechanical and thermodynamic properties of amorphous materials are governed by their disordered network at microscales, but the detail remains elusive.

Background &lt;p&gt;Atypical meningiomas are common central nervous system neoplasms with high recurrence rate and poorer prognosis compared to their grade I counterparts. Surgical excision and radiotherapy remains the mainstay therapy but medical treatments are limited. We explore new drug candidates using computational drug repurposing based on the gene expression signature of atypical meningioma tissue with subsequent analysis of drug-generated expression profiles. We further explore possible mechanisms of action for the identified drug candidates using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We extracted gene expression profiles for atypical meningiomas (12 samples) and normal meningeal tissue (4 samples) from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which were then used to generate a gene signature comprising of 281 differentially expressed genes. Drug candidates were explored using both the Board Institute Connectivity Map (cmap) and Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). Functional analysis of significant differential gene expression for drug candidates was performed with IPA.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using our integrated approach, we identified multiple, already licensed, drug candidates such as emetine, verteporfin, phenoxybenzamine and trazodone. Analysis with IPA revealed that these drugs target signal cascades potentially relevant in pathogenesis of meningiomas, particular examples are the effect on ERK by trazodone, MAP kinases by emetine, and YAP-1 protein by verteporfin.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Gene expression profiling and use of drug expression profiles have yielded several plausible drug candidates for treating atypical meningioma, some of which have already been suggested by preceding studies. Although our analyses suggested multiple anti-tumour mechanisms for these drugs, further &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies are required for validation.&lt;/p&gt; Importance of the study &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge this is the first study which combines relatively new, yet established computational techniques to identify additional treatments for a difficult to manage cerebral neoplasm.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hospital inpatients often experience medical and psychiatric problems simultaneously. Although this implies a certain relationship between healthcare utilization and costs, this relationship has never been systematically reviewed.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective is to examine the extent to which medical-psychiatric comorbidities relate to health-economic outcomes in general and in different subgroups. If the relationship is significant, this would give additional reasons to facilitate the search for targeted and effective treatments for this complex population.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A systematic review in Embase, Medline, Psycinfo, Cochrane, Web of Science and Google Scholar was performed up to August 2016 and included cross-references from included studies. Only peer-reviewed empirical studies examining the impact of inpatient medical-psychiatric comorbidities on three health-economic outcomes (length of stay (LOS), medical costs and rehospitalizations) were included. Study design was not an exclusion criterion, there were no restrictions on publication dates and patients included had to be over 18 years. The examined populations consisted of inpatients with medical-psychiatric comorbidities and controls. The controls were inpatients without a comorbid medical or psychiatric disorder. Non-English studies were excluded.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From electronic literature databases, 3165 extracted articles were scrutinized on the basis of title and abstract. This resulted in a full-text review of 86 articles: 52 unique studies were included. The review showed that the presence of medical-psychiatric comorbidity was related to increased LOS, higher medical costs and more rehospitalizations. The meta-analysis revealed that patients with comorbid depression had an increased mean LOS of 4.38 days compared to patients without comorbidity (95% CI: 3.07 to 5.68, I2 = 31%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Medical-psychiatric comorbidity is related to increased LOS, medical costs and rehospitalization; this is also shown for specific subgroups. This study had some limitations; namely, that the studies were very heterogenetic and, in some cases, of poor quality in terms of risk of bias. Nevertheless, the findings remain valid and justify the search for targeted and effective interventions for this complex population.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Luc Jansen</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Luc Jansen, Maarten van Schijndel, Jeroen van Waarde, Jan van Busschbach&lt;/p&gt;

Amino acid signaling mediated by the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is fundamental to cell growth and metabolism. However, how cells negatively regulate amino acid signaling remains largely unknown. Here, we show that interaction between 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc), a subunit of multiple amino acid transporters, and the multifunctional hub protein girders of actin filaments (Girdin) down-regulates mTORC1 activity. 4F2hc interacts with Girdin in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)- and amino acid signaling–dependent manners to translocate to the lysosome. The resultant decrease in cell surface 4F2hc leads to lowered cytoplasmic glutamine (Gln) and leucine (Leu) content, which down-regulates amino acid signaling. Consistently, Girdin depletion augments amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation and inhibits amino acid deprivation–induced autophagy. These findings uncovered the mechanism underlying negative regulation of amino acid signaling, which may play a role in tightly regulated cell growth and metabolism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tMWvVxdBQbk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Liang Weng</name></author><crawled>1521049595242</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Liang Weng, Yi-Peng Han, Atsushi Enomoto, Yasuyuki Kitaura, Shushi Nagamori, Yoshikatsu Kanai, Naoya Asai, Jian An, Maki Takagishi, Masato Asai, Shinji Mii, Takashi Masuko, Yoshiharu Shimomura, Masahide Takahashi&lt;/p&gt;

To move a hard table together, humans may coordinate by following the dominant partner’s motion [1–4], but this strategy is unsuitable for a soft mattress where the perceived forces are small. How do partners readily coordinate in such differing interaction dynamics? To address this, we investigated how pairs tracked a target using flexion-extension of their wrists, which were coupled by a hard, medium or soft virtual elastic band. Tracking performance monotonically increased with a stiffer band for the worse partner, who had higher tracking error, at the cost of the skilled partner’s muscular effort. This suggests that the worse partner followed the skilled one’s lead, but simulations show that the results are better explained by a model where partners share movement goals through the forces, whilst the coupling dynamics determine the capacity of communicable information. This model elucidates the versatile mechanism by which humans can coordinate during both hard and soft physical interactions to ensure maximum performance with minimal effort.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bXD1PWYahz8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Atsushi Takagi</name></author><crawled>1521740722341</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Atsushi Takagi, Francesco Usai, Gowrishankar Ganesh, Vittorio Sanguineti, Etienne Burdet&lt;/p&gt;

Bats lower the emission SPL when approaching a target. The SPL reduction has been explained by intensity compensation which implies that bats adjust the emission SPL to perceive the retuning echoes at the same level. For a better understanding of this control mechanism we recorded the echolocation signals of four &lt;i&gt;Myotis myotis&lt;/i&gt; with an onboard microphone when foraging in the passive mode for rustling mealworms offered in two feeding dishes with different target strength, and determined the reduction rate for the emission SPL and the increase rate for the SPL of the returning echoes.

Bats lower the emission SPL when approaching a target. The SPL reduction has been explained by intensity compensation which implies that bats adjust the emission SPL to perceive the retuning echoes at the same level. For a better understanding of this control mechanism we recorded the echolocation signals of four &lt;i&gt;Myotis myotis&lt;/i&gt; with an onboard microphone when foraging in the passive mode for rustling mealworms offered in two feeding dishes with different target strength, and determined the reduction rate for the emission SPL and the increase rate for the SPL of the returning echoes.

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ.

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts. Surprisingly, our data show that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells are significantly enhanced in the genital tract TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice during mid-stage &lt;i&gt;Chlamydial&lt;/i&gt; infection. In late-stage infections, both mouse strains developed hydrosalpinx; however, the extent of hydrosalpinx was more severe in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Together, these data suggest that TLR3 promotes the clearance of &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; during early and mid-stages of genital tract infection, and that loss of TLR3 is detrimental in the development hydrosalpinx.</content></content><author><name>Sebastian E.

Our first aim was to compare the anaerobic threshold (AnT) determined by the incremental protocol with the reverse lactate threshold test (RLT), investigating the previous cycling experience effect. Secondarily, an alternative RLT application based on heart rate was proposed. Two groups (12 per group-according to cycling experience) were evaluated on cycle ergometer. The incremental protocol started at 25 W with increments of 25 W at each 3 minutes, and the AnT was calculated by bissegmentation, onset of blood lactate concentration and maximal deviation methods. The RLT was applied in two phases: a) lactate priming segment; and b) reverse segment; the AnT (AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt;) was calculated based on a second order polynomial function. The AnT from the RLT was calculated based on the heart rate (AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt;) by the second order polynomial function. In regard of the Study 1, most of statistical procedures converged for similarity between the AnT determined from the bissegmentation method and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt;. For 83% of non-experienced and 75% of experienced subjects the bias was 4% and 2%, respectively. In Study 2, no difference was found between the AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt; and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt;. For 83% of non-experienced and 91% of experienced subjects, the bias between AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt; and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt; was similar (i.e. 6%). In summary, the AnT determined by the incremental protocol and RLT are consistent. The AnT can be determined during the RLT via heart rate, improving its applicability. However, future studies are required to improve the agreement between variables.</content></content><author><name>Leonardo Henrique Dalcheco Messias</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leonardo Henrique Dalcheco Messias, Emanuel Elias Camolese Polisel, Fúlvia Barros Manchado-Gobatto&lt;/p&gt;

For 83% of non-experienced and 91% of experienced subjects, the bias between AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt; and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt; was similar (i.e. 6%). In summary, the AnT determined by the incremental protocol and RLT are consistent. The AnT can be determined during the RLT via heart rate, improving its applicability. However, future studies are required to improve the agreement between variables.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00246</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Correction to Uncovering the Determinants of a Highly Perturbed Tyrosine pKa in the Active Site of Ketosteroid Isomerase</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00246</link><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_162691d45c6:5a2b21:bdf8aaf1</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00246</originId><crawled>1522181948870</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><fingerprint>20545b0e</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00246&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Plant-growth promotion has been linked to the &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; genus since the beginning of this research field.

Strain SVBP6, isolated from bulk soil of an agricultural plot, showed a broad antifungal activity and several other plant-probiotic activities. As this species has been recently described, and it seems like some plant-growth promoting (PGP) traits do not belong to the classical pseudomonads toolbox, we decide to explore the SVBP6 genome via an bioinformatic approach.

Background &lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has a reported greater prevalence and poorer treatment outcomes in people living with HIV (PLWH) than comparable HIV-uninfected cohorts. We conducted a cross-sectional study to delineate the factors driving T2D in PLWH in an ethnically diverse cohort, and additionally observed how these have changed over time.&lt;/p&gt; Setting &lt;p&gt;We studied a diverse HIV cohort in London to determine the prevalence and risk factors for T2D, and compared them to a cohort studied 10 years previously.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients were classified as normoglycaemic (fasting glucose &amp;lt;6.0 mmol/l) or dysglycaemic (≥6.0 mmol/l). The relative contribution to dysglycaemia of modifiable and fixed factors, including demographics, anthropometrics, comorbidities, immune status, and HIV therapy, were analysed using univariate and logistic regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;T2D prevalence was 15.1% in 2015 with a relative risk of 2.4 compared to the general population. The prevalence compared to 6.8% ten years earlier. The 2015 versus the 2005 cohort was significantly older (median age 49 (42–57) years versus 41 (IQR 35–47), p&amp;lt;0.001), had a higher BMI (27.4 (23.3–29.9) versus 24.9 (22.4–28.0) kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, p = 0.019) and hypertensive (37.9% versus 19.6 respectively, p&amp;lt;0.001). The strongest predictors of dysglycaemia in the 2015 cohort were hepatic steatosis and hypertension, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) 6.74 (3.48–13.03) and 2.92 (1.66–5.16) respectively, and also HIV-related factors of weight gain following antiretroviral initiation and longer known duration of HIV infection (OR 1.07 (1.04–1.11) and 1.06 (1.02–1.10) respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The alarmingly high prevalence of T2D in HIV requires improved screening, targeted to older patients and those with a longer duration of exposure to antiretrovirals. Effective diabetes prevention and management strategies are needed urgently to reduce this risk; such interventions should target both conventional risk factors, such as abdominal obesity, and HIV-specific risk factors such as weight gain following initiation of antiretrovirals.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Alastair D.

Recent studies have suggested that proficient bilinguals show morphological decomposition in the L2, but the question remains as to whether this process is modulated by the cognateness of the morphemic constituents of L2 words and by L2 proficiency. To answer this question was the main goal of the present research. For that purpose, a masked priming lexical decision task was conducted manipulating for the first time the degree of orthographic overlap of the L2 word as a whole, as well as of their morphemic constituents (bases and suffixes). Thirty-four European Portuguese-English bilinguals (16 intermediate and 18 high-proficient) and 16 English native-speaking controls performed the task in English. Results revealed that both groups of bilinguals decomposed words as the native control group. Importantly, results also showed that morphological priming effects were sensitive not only to cross-language similarities of words as a whole, but also to their morphemic constituents (especially, suffixes).</content></content><author><name>Montserrat Comesaña</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Montserrat Comesaña, Pauline Bertin, Helena Oliveira, Ana Paula Soares, Juan Andrés Hernández-Cabrera, Séverine Casalis&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The transcription factor SOX2 has been identified as a lineage survival oncogene in squamous cell carcinoma and copy number gain is a common event in several human malignancies including head and neck cancer. However, the regulation and function of SOX2 during carcinogenesis as well as its prognostic value appears to be highly context dependent. As an example, high SOX2 expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is related to a favorable prognosis, while it is associated with poor outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. More recently, higher SOX2 levels and improved survival was also reported for head and neck SCC (HNSCC), and silencing of SOX2 expression in HNSCC cell lines revealed a mesenchymal-like phenotype with prominent vimentin expression. So far, SOX2 expression and its clinical relevance for other head and neck cancers, such as adenoid cystic carcinoma (HNACC) have not been sufficiently investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;SOX2, vimentin and E-cadherin expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining on serial sections from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples of a patient cohort (n = 45) with primary ACC and correlated with patient and tumor characteristics as well as survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;High SOX2 expression was found in 14 (31%) primary tumor specimens and was significantly correlated with a N0 lymph node status (p = 0.04), while low SOX2 expression was correlated with a solid growth pattern (p = 0.031). Of the 45 patients, 27 tumor samples resembled an EMT-like phenotype, as assessed by high vimentin and low E-cadherin levels. However, in HNACC SOX2 levels were neither correlated with vimentin nor with E-cadherin expression, further supporting a context dependent regulation and function of SOX2 in distinct tumor entities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The absence of SOX2 was predominantly found in solid HNACC, which are characterized by a more aggressive phenotype in ACC.

Analysis found that cob and thi genes are abundant and likely very essential than other vit genes.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005473</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>6</engagement><title>Ultrastructural localisation of protein interactions using conditionally stable nanobodies</title><recrawled>1522951034312</recrawled><engagementRate>0.27</engagementRate><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e9:76251cdd</id><updated>1522962000000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005473</originId><published>1522962000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005473</link><fingerprint>9519aa11</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/mrmHIECypRw/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas Ariotti, James Rae, Nichole Giles, Nick Martel, Emma Sierecki, Yann Gambin, Thomas E.

We describe the development and application of a suite of modular tools for high-resolution detection of proteins and intracellular protein complexes by electron microscopy (EM). Conditionally stable GFP- and mCherry-binding nanobodies (termed csGBP and csChBP, respectively) are characterized using a cell-free expression and analysis system and subsequently fused to an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) enzyme. Expression of these cassettes alongside fluorescently labelled proteins results in recruitment and stabilisation of APEX, whereas unbound APEX nanobodies are efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This greatly simplifies correlative analyses, enables detection of less-abundant proteins, and eliminates the need to balance expression levels between fluorescently labelled and APEX nanobody proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system to bimolecular complementation (‘EM split-fluorescent protein’), for localisation of protein–protein interactions at the ultrastructural level.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrmHIECypRw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Nicholas Ariotti</name></author><crawled>1522950975641</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas Ariotti, James Rae, Nichole Giles, Nick Martel, Emma Sierecki, Yann Gambin, Thomas E.

Computing power and theory have, however, long been insufficient to enable AFE calculations to be routinely applied in early stage drug discovery. One of the major difficulties in performing AFE calculations is the length of time required for calculations to converge to an ensemble average. CPU implementations of MD‐based free energy algorithms can effectively only reach tens of nanoseconds per day for systems on the order of 50,000 atoms, even running on massively parallel supercomputers. Therefore, converged free energy calculations on large numbers of potential lead compounds are often untenable, preventing researchers from gaining crucial insight into molecular recognition, potential druggability and other crucial areas of interest.

We present here a seamless GPU implementation, within the PMEMD module of the AMBER molecular dynamics package, of thermodynamic integration (TI) capable of reaching speeds of &gt;140 ns/day for a 44,907‐atom system, with accuracy equivalent to the existing CPU implementation in AMBER.

Before the technology matures and gains practical application, further study on the form and the mixing process of calcium-based additives for cement clinker coproduction will be required.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23802-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Genomic diversity in ochratoxigenic and non ochratoxigenic strains of Aspergillus carbonarius</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23802-8</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1628acdc610:9385a96:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23802-8/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23802_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>444</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23802-8</originId><published>1522738800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>60b34735</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/OTr5uSwDgSQ/s41598-018-23802-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genomic diversity in ochratoxigenic and non ochratoxigenic strains of &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus carbonarius&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genomic diversity in ochratoxigenic and non ochratoxigenic strains of &amp;lt;i&gt;Aspergillus carbonarius&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 03 April 2018;

Large placental and birth weight, and fetal male sex were factors for a long cord, which again was associated with a doubled risk of intrauterine and perinatal death, and increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome. Anomalous cord insertion, female sex, and a small placenta were associated with a short cord, which was associated with increased risk of fetal malformations, placental complications, caesarean delivery, non-cephalic presentation, perinatal and intrauterine death. At term, cord knot was associated with a quadrupled risk of perinatal death. The combination of a cord knot and entanglement had a more than additive effect to the association to perinatal death. There was a more than doubled risk of recurrence of a long or short cord, knot and entanglement in a subsequent pregnancy of the same woman.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Cord length is influenced both by maternal and fetal factors, and there is increased risk of recurrence.

In particular the universal enrichment of negative charge and the larger than average SES area for a polar atom on the surface of a water-soluble protein suggest that from a protein-solvent interaction perspective to fold into a native state is to optimize the electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between solvent molecules and the surface polar atoms of a protein rather than to only minimize its apolar surface area.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Diel hysteresis between soil respiration and soil temperature in a biological soil crust covered desert ecosystem</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd085:7c9981b6</id><updated>1523048400000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</originId><published>1523048400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e6b1c326</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guan, Xinrong Li, Peng Zhang, Yongle Chen&lt;/p&gt;
Soil respiration induced by biological soil crusts (BSCs) is an important process in the carbon (C) cycle in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, where vascular plants are restricted by the harsh environment, particularly the limited soil moisture. However, the interaction between temperature and soil respiration remains uncertain because of the number of factors that control soil respiration, including temperature and soil moisture, especially in BSC-dominated areas. In this study, the soil respiration in moss-dominated crusts and lichen-dominated crusts was continuously measured using an automated soil respiration system over a one-year period from November 2015 to October 2016 in the Shapotou region of the Tengger Desert, northern China. The results indicated that over daily cycles, the half-hourly soil respiration rates in both types of BSC-covered areas were commonly related to the soil temperature. The observed diel hysteresis between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature in the BSC-covered areas was limited by nonlinearity loops with semielliptical shapes, and soil temperature often peaked later than the half-hourly soil respiration rates in the BSC-covered areas. The average lag times between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature for both types of BSC-covered areas were two hours over the diel cycles, and they were negatively and linearly related to the volumetric soil water content. Our results highlight the diel hysteresis phenomenon that occurs between soil respiration rates and soil temperatures in BSC-covered areas and the negative response of this phenomenon to soil moisture, which may influence total C budget evaluations. Therefore, the interactive effects of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration in BSC-covered areas should be considered in global carbon cycle models of desert ecosystems.</content></content><author><name>Chao Guan</name></author><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guan, Xinrong Li, Peng Zhang, Yongle Chen&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of the study was to develop Tizanidine HCl (TZN) and Meloxicam (MLX) loaded bilayer mucoadhesive films intended for buccal administration, aiming to enhance the bioavailability. Bilayer films were prepared by solvent evaporation technique selecting arabinoxylan (ARX) as a sustained release (SR) layer forming polymer and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) E-15 as an immediate release (IR) layer-forming polymer. Prepared films were subjected to &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug release, surface morphology, mechanical strength, compatibility of the ingredients, drug contents, &lt;i&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/i&gt; mucoadhesion strength and drug permeation. Crossover study design was applied to study the i&lt;i&gt;n-vivo&lt;/i&gt; pharmacokinetics by using albino rabbits. Various pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; of both drugs loaded in films were compared with standard solution/dispersion administered to the rabbits at the dose of 1mg/kg. The results unveiled instant release and permeation of MLX from IR layer, while good controlled release and permeation characteristics of TZN from SR films over 8 h. films were of uniform thickness with smooth surface and satisfactory mechanical strength. Mucoadhesion strength was sufficient to provide suitable contact time with mucosal membrane. The pharmacokinetic study exhibited prompt absorption of MLX with better AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (6655.64 ng/ml*h vs 6538.99 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (436.98 ng/ml vs 411.33 ng/ml) from oral dispersion.

&lt;i&gt;Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARα)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Egl nine homolog 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;EGLN3)&lt;/i&gt; play critical roles in facilitating the adaptation to a hypoxic environment. However, the relationship between &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; variants and hypoxic adaptation remains poorly understood in Tibetan chickens. To better understand the effects of genetic variation, we sequenced exons of &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; in 138 Lowland chickens (LC) from 7 breeds that were located in Emei, Miyi, Shimian, Wanyuan, Pengxian, and Muchuan in the Sichuan province, and Wenchang in the Hainan province (altitudes for these locations are below 1800 meters). Total 166 Tibetan chickens (TC) from 7 subpopulations that were located in Shigatse, Lhoka, Lhasa, Garze, Aba, Diqing and Yushu in the Tibetan area were also sequenced (altitudes greater than 2700 meters). One single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs316017491, C &gt; T) was identified in &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and was shared by TC and LC with no significant difference for allele frequencies between them (P &gt; 0.05). Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP1, A29410G; SNP2, rs13886097; SNP3, T29467C; SNP4, rs735915170; SNP5, rs736599044; and SNP6, rs740077421) including one non-synonymous mutation (SNP2, T &gt; C) were identified in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt;. This is the first report of SNP1 and SNP3. There was a difference between TC and LC for allele frequencies (P &amp;lt;0.01), except for SNP1, SNP4, and SNP5) The fix index statistic test indicated that there was population differentiation between TC and LC for SNP2, SNP3, and SNP6 in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genetic distance among chickens, finch and great tit were close for both &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt;. Bioinformatics analysis of &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; showed that SNP2 leads to an amino acid substitution of Ile for Met, which results in the protein being more likely to be hydrolyzed.

Background &lt;p&gt;A number of studies have investigated cognitive impairment in paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) but deficits regarding executive functions have not been comprehensively assessed up to now. This study was meant to explore cognitive impairment in German paediatric MS patients with a focus on deficits in executive functions and relate these to clinical disease parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Forty paediatric MS patients, which presented at the German centre for MS in childhood and adolescence, were assessed for cognitive deficits applying a very comprehensive battery of cognitive tests including the Wechsler Intelligence scale and subtests of the D-KEFS for executive functions. The performance of MS patients was compared with a group of age and sex matched healthy controls using between-subjects ANOVAs. Paediatric MS patients performed worse in tests assessing verbal comprehension and fluency, processing speed, memory, calculation skills and other executive functions. Arranged by the cognitive domain, group differences were most pronounced regarding verbal comprehension and fluency for the WISC subtests Comprehension (p = 0.000), Vocabulary (p = 0.003) and Information (p = 0.005); regarding processing speed for the written SDMT (p = 0.001) and the WISC subtest Coding (p = 0.005); regarding memory for the VLMT training (p = 0.007) and the BASIC MLT pattern learning training (p = 0.009); regarding executive functions including working memory for the WISC subtest Arithmetics (p = 0.002), the D-KEFS Design Fluency (p = 0.003) and the Corsi block tapping backward task (p = 0.003). Fluid reasoning was largely intact. Relations of cognitive performance and clinical parameters were assessed in MS patients. Disease duration was associated with a reduced performance in tests belonging to the domains verbal comprehension and fluency (WISC Vocabulary: p = 0.034, WISC Information: p = 0.015) and fluid reasoning (WISC Picture Completion: p = 0.003) as well as the WISC Working Memory Index (p = 0.047). Patients with a disease onset between 11 and 14 years performed better in fluid reasoning (WISC matrix reasoning: p = 0.024) than patients with a disease onset at an age above 14. The number of relapses negatively influenced the visual spatial memory performance (BASIC MLT pattern learning training: p = 0.009).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The distribution of cognitive deficits in a representative group German of paediatric MS patients was similar to the pattern known from other European and North-American cohorts. Paediatric MS patients do have cognitive deficits in executive functions and key qualities necessary for successful school performance.

Background &amp;amp; aims &lt;p&gt;The causes of gastrointestinal complaints in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remain poorly understood. Altered nerve function has emerged as an important pathogenic factor as IBS mucosal biopsy supernatants consistently activate enteric and sensory neurons. We investigated the neurally active molecular components of such supernatants from patients with IBS and quiescent ulcerative colitis (UC).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Effects of supernatants from 7 healthy controls (HC), 20 IBS and 12 UC patients on human and guinea pig submucous neurons were studied with neuroimaging techniques. We identify differentially expressed proteins with proteome analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Nerve activation by IBS supernatants was prevented by the protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) antagonist SCHE79797. UC supernatants also activated enteric neurons through protease dependent mechanisms but without PAR1 involvement. Proteome analysis of the supernatants identified 204 proteins, among them 17 proteases as differentially expressed between IBS, UC and HC. Of those the four proteases elastase 3a, chymotrypsin C, proteasome subunit type beta-2 and an unspecified isoform of complement C3 were significantly more abundant in IBS compared to HC and UC supernatants. Of eight proteases, which were upregulated in IBS, the combination of elastase 3a, cathepsin L and proteasome alpha subunit-4 showed the highest prediction accuracy of 98% to discriminate between IBS and HC groups.

Background &amp;amp; aims &lt;p&gt;The causes of gastrointestinal complaints in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remain poorly understood. Altered nerve function has emerged as an important pathogenic factor as IBS mucosal biopsy supernatants consistently activate enteric and sensory neurons. We investigated the neurally active molecular components of such supernatants from patients with IBS and quiescent ulcerative colitis (UC).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Effects of supernatants from 7 healthy controls (HC), 20 IBS and 12 UC patients on human and guinea pig submucous neurons were studied with neuroimaging techniques. We identify differentially expressed proteins with proteome analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Nerve activation by IBS supernatants was prevented by the protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) antagonist SCHE79797. UC supernatants also activated enteric neurons through protease dependent mechanisms but without PAR1 involvement. Proteome analysis of the supernatants identified 204 proteins, among them 17 proteases as differentially expressed between IBS, UC and HC. Of those the four proteases elastase 3a, chymotrypsin C, proteasome subunit type beta-2 and an unspecified isoform of complement C3 were significantly more abundant in IBS compared to HC and UC supernatants. Of eight proteases, which were upregulated in IBS, the combination of elastase 3a, cathepsin L and proteasome alpha subunit-4 showed the highest prediction accuracy of 98% to discriminate between IBS and HC groups. Elastase synergistically potentiated the effects of histamine and serotonin–the two other main neuroactive substances in the IBS supernatants. A serine protease inhibitor isolated from the probiotic &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium longum&lt;/i&gt; NCC2705 (SERPIN&lt;sub&gt;BL&lt;/sub&gt;), known to inhibit elastase-like proteases, prevented nerve activation by IBS supernatants.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Proteases in IBS and UC supernatants were responsible for nerve activation. Our data demonstrate that proteases, particularly those signalling through neuronal PAR1, are biomarker candidates for IBS, and protease profiling may be used to characterise IBS.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>31</engagement><title>Nigeria hit by unprecedented Lassa fever outbreak</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1201?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d2514b:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6381/1201.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1201?rss=1</originId><crawled>1521143966531</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Epidemiology, Medicine, Diseases, Virology</item></keywords><fingerprint>31c8d8f0</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1201?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Roberts, L.</name></author><published>1521135592000</published></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01094</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] mPEG5k-b-PLGA2k/PCL3.4k/MCT Mixed Micelles as Carriers of Disulfiram for Improving Plasma Stability and Antitumor Effect in Vivo</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01094</link><id>hkv7tkf6rNovbaIxikRBMOPZEsTuri716fXYbY8OcAk=_16220c29f61:1635b48:bdf8aaf1</id><recrawled>1521571526502</recrawled><unread>False</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01094</originId><crawled>1520968048481</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01094/20180313/images/medium/mp-2017-010942_0009.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>195</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><fingerprint>e16f4701</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01094/20180313/images/medium/mp-2017-010942_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01094&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of anaphylaxis-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the first step toward developing preventative strategies and optimizing care systems. We aimed to describe and compare epidemiological features and clinical outcomes among patients with anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs according to causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified emergency medical service (EMS)-treated anaphylaxis-associated OHCA patients from a nationwide OHCA registry between 2008 and 2015. We compared epidemiological characteristics and outcomes according to causal agents (a natural agents group and an iatrogenic agents group) and evaluated temporal variability in incidence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare survival to discharge between causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the study period (8 years), the total number of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs was 233. A total of 224 eligible cases were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients (85.6%) in the natural agents group and 32 patients (14.3%) in the iatrogenic agents group. There was significant diurnal and seasonal variability in the frequency of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values&amp;lt;0.01 for both), with the highest incidences occurring during the day (7:01 am to 3 pm; 64.6%) and in summer (June to August, 48.7%). Compared with the natural agents group, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for survival to discharge in the iatrogenic agents group was statistically insignificant (AOR 3.61, 95% CI 0.86 to 15.06).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is considerably low, and significant temporal variability, with a peak during the day and in summer, is evident.

&lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; is the causative agent of melioidosis and regarded as a bioterrorism threat. It can adapt to the nutrient-limited environment as the bacteria can survive in triple distilled water for 16 years. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; exhibits intrinsic resistance to diverse groups of antibiotics in particular while growing in biofilms. Recently, nutrient-limited condition influenced both biofilm formation and ceftazidime (CAZ) tolerance of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; were found. However, there is no information about how nutrient-limitation together with antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment affects the structure of the biofilm produced by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, no comparative study to investigate the biofilm architectures of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and the related &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; under different nutrient concentrations has been reported. Therefore, this study aims to provide new information on the effects of four antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;. ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IMI), meropenem (MEM) and doxycycline (DOX) on biofilm architecture of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; with different nutrient concentrations under static and flow conditions using confocal laser scanning microscopy.

The findings of this study indicate that nutrient-limited environment enhanced survival of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm after exposure to the tested antibiotics. The shedding planktonic &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; were also found to have increased CAZ tolerance in nutrient-limited environment. However, killing activities of MEM and IMI were stronger than CAZ and DOX on &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; both in planktonic cells and in 2-day old biofilm.

Differences in biofilm architecture were observed for biofilms grown under static and flow conditions. Under static conditions, biofilms grown in full strength modified Vogel and Bonner’s medium (MVBM) showed honeycomb-like architecture while a knitted-like structure was observed under limited nutrient condition (0.1×MVBM). Under flow conditions, biofilms grown in MVBM showed a multilayer structure while merely dispersed bacteria were found when grown in 0.1×MVBM. Altogether, this study provides more insight on the effect of four antibiotics against &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm under different nutrient and flow conditions.

Chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), play essential roles in the human immune system, they are involved in cancer metastasis as well as in HIV-infection. A plethora of studies show that homo- and heterodimers or even higher order oligomers of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 modulate receptor function. In addition, membrane cholesterol affects chemokine receptor activity. However, structural information about homo- and heterodimers formed by chemokine receptors and their interplay with cholesterol is limited. Here, we report homo- and heterodimer configurations of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 at atomistic detail, as obtained from thousands of molecular dynamics simulations. The observed homodimerization patterns were similar for the closely related CC chemokine receptors, yet they differed significantly between the CC receptors and CXCR4. Despite their high sequence identity, cholesterol modulated the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. Chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2. Furthermore, associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns. This work provides a first comprehensive structural overview over the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hs4EV4VzCNk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Stefan Gahbauer</name></author><crawled>1520877508959</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Gahbauer, Kristyna Pluhackova, Rainer A.

Here, we report homo- and heterodimer configurations of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 at atomistic detail, as obtained from thousands of molecular dynamics simulations. The observed homodimerization patterns were similar for the closely related CC chemokine receptors, yet they differed significantly between the CC receptors and CXCR4. Despite their high sequence identity, cholesterol modulated the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. Chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2. Furthermore, associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns. This work provides a first comprehensive structural overview over the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hs4EV4VzCNk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Protein-Protein Interaction Network Analysis and Identification of Key Players in N-hydroxy-nor-L-Arg (nor-NOHA) and N(omega)-hydroxy-L-arginine (NOHA) Mediated Pathways for Treatment of Cancer Through Arginase Inhibiton: Insights from Systems Biology [CONFIRMATORY RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281030v1?rss=1</link><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16220b9f981:64f7f8:7d6c1c1c</id><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/13/281030</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281030v1?rss=1</originId><published>1520924400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f045945f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281030v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>L-arginine is involved in a number of processes in our bodies.

These data suggest that NKG2DLs are not equivalent in their capacity to activate NKG2D and establish a previously unknown paradigm in how ligand-induced changes to the nanoscale organization of the cell surface can affect immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>A novel calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580), suppresses the parathyroid cell function with little effect on the gastrointestinal tract or CYP isozymes &amp;lt;i&gt;in vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195316</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f63:34f43e70</id><updated>1522789200000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195316</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195316</originId><published>1522789200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6e5b4f3</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195316</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takehisa Kawata, Shin Tokunaga, Miki Murai, Nami Masuda, Waka Haruyama, Youji Shoukei, Yutaka Hisada, Tetsuya Yanagida, Hiroshi Miyazaki, Michihito Wada, Tadao Akizawa, Masafumi Fukagawa&lt;/p&gt;
Cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet), an oral calcimimetic agent has been widely used for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In sharp contrast to vitamin D receptor activators, cinacalcet suppresses SHPT without inducing hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia. Nevertheless, some patients remain refractory to SHPT with this agent, as the dose cannot be sufficiently increased due to gastrointestinal symptoms. In order to resolve this issue, we have developed a newly synthesized calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580). In a rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy, oral administration of evocalcet efficiently suppressed the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). With regard to the gastro-intestinal effects, cinacalcet induced a significant delay in gastric emptying in rats, while evocalcet did no marked effects on it. Evocalcet also demonstrated the less induction of emesis compared to cinacalcet in common marmosets. The pharmacological effects of evocalcet were observed at lower doses because of its higher bioavailability than cinacalcet, which may have contributed to the reduced GI tract symptoms. In addition, evocalcet showed no substantial direct inhibition of any CYP isozymes in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; liver microsome assay, suggesting a better profile in drug interactions than cinacalcet that inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. These findings suggest that evocalcet can be a better alternative to cinacalcet, an oral calcimimetic agent, with a wider safety margin.</content></content><author><name>Takehisa Kawata</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takehisa Kawata, Shin Tokunaga, Miki Murai, Nami Masuda, Waka Haruyama, Youji Shoukei, Yutaka Hisada, Tetsuya Yanagida, Hiroshi Miyazaki, Michihito Wada, Tadao Akizawa, Masafumi Fukagawa&lt;/p&gt;

The main drawback of ranking of researchers by the number of papers, citations or by the Hirsch index is ignoring the problem of distributing authorship among authors in multi-author publications. So far, the single-author or multi-author publications contribute to the publication record of a researcher equally. This full counting scheme is apparently unfair and causes unjust disproportions, in particular, if ranked researchers have distinctly different collaboration profiles. These disproportions are removed by less common fractional or authorship-weighted counting schemes, which can distribute the authorship credit more properly and suppress a tendency to unjustified inflation of co-authors. The urgent need of widely adopting a fair ranking scheme in practise is exemplified by analysing citation profiles of several highly-cited astronomers and astrophysicists. While the full counting scheme often leads to completely incorrect and misleading ranking, the fractional or authorship-weighted schemes are more accurate and applicable to ranking of researchers as well as research teams. In addition, they suppress differences in ranking among scientific disciplines. These more appropriate schemes should urgently be adopted by scientific publication databases as the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) or the Scopus (Elsevier).</content></content><author><name>Václav Vavryčuk</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Václav Vavryčuk&lt;/p&gt;

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease characterized by epithelial cell activation, expansion of the fibroblast population and excessive extracellular matrix accumulation. The mechanisms are incompletely understood but evidence indicates that the deregulation of several proteases contributes to its pathogenesis. Transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4) is a novel type II transmembrane serine protease that may promote migration and facilitate epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), two critical processes in the pathogenesis of IPF. Thus, we hypothesized that over-expression of TMPRSS4 in the lung could promote the initiation and/or progression of IPF. In this study we first evaluated the expression and localization of TMPRSS4 in IPF lungs by real time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Then we examined the lung fibrotic response in wild-type and TMPRSS4 deficient mice using the bleomycin-induced lung injury model. We found that this protease is upregulated in IPF lungs, where was primarily expressed by epithelial and mast cells. Paralleling the findings in vivo, TMPRSS4 was expressed by alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro and unexpectedly, provoked an increase of E-cadherin. No expression was observed in normal human or IPF lung fibroblasts. The lung fibrotic response evaluated at 28 days after bleomycin injury was markedly attenuated in the haplodeficient and deficient TMPRSS4 mice. By morphology, a significant reduction of the fibrotic index was observed in KO and heterozygous mice which was confirmed by measurement of collagen content (hydroxyproline: WT: 164±21.1 μg/lung versus TMPRSS4 haploinsufficient: 110.2±14.3 μg/lung and TMPRSS4 deficient mice: 114.1±24.2 μg/lung (p&amp;lt;0.01). As in IPF, TMPRSS4 was also expressed in epithelial and mast cells. These findings indicate that TMPRSS4 is upregulated in IPF lungs and that may have a profibrotic role.</content></content><author><name>Ana Valero-Jiménez</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Valero-Jiménez, Joaquín Zúñiga, José Cisneros, Carina Becerril, Alfonso Salgado, Marco Checa, Ivette Buendía-Roldán, Criselda Mendoza-Milla, Miguel Gaxiola, Annie Pardo, Moisés Selman&lt;/p&gt;
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease characterized by epithelial cell activation, expansion of the fibroblast population and excessive extracellular matrix accumulation. The mechanisms are incompletely understood but evidence indicates that the deregulation of several proteases contributes to its pathogenesis. Transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4) is a novel type II transmembrane serine protease that may promote migration and facilitate epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), two critical processes in the pathogenesis of IPF. Thus, we hypothesized that over-expression of TMPRSS4 in the lung could promote the initiation and/or progression of IPF. In this study we first evaluated the expression and localization of TMPRSS4 in IPF lungs by real time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Then we examined the lung fibrotic response in wild-type and TMPRSS4 deficient mice using the bleomycin-induced lung injury model. We found that this protease is upregulated in IPF lungs, where was primarily expressed by epithelial and mast cells. Paralleling the findings in vivo, TMPRSS4 was expressed by alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro and unexpectedly, provoked an increase of E-cadherin. No expression was observed in normal human or IPF lung fibroblasts. The lung fibrotic response evaluated at 28 days after bleomycin injury was markedly attenuated in the haplodeficient and deficient TMPRSS4 mice. By morphology, a significant reduction of the fibrotic index was observed in KO and heterozygous mice which was confirmed by measurement of collagen content (hydroxyproline: WT: 164±21.1 μg/lung versus TMPRSS4 haploinsufficient: 110.2±14.3 μg/lung and TMPRSS4 deficient mice: 114.1±24.2 μg/lung (p&amp;lt;0.01). As in IPF, TMPRSS4 was also expressed in epithelial and mast cells. These findings indicate that TMPRSS4 is upregulated in IPF lungs and that may have a profibrotic role.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006066</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>44</engagement><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&amp;lt;/i&gt; 2017 Reviewer and Editorial Board Thank You</title><recrawled>1521145272972</recrawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006066</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1622ace2bc4:b9c551:bdf8aaf1</id><updated>1521147600000</updated><unread>False</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006066</originId><published>1521147600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>d9383fc0</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/cyxasNTvFuQ/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cyxasNTvFuQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1521136577476</crawled><description>&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cyxasNTvFuQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Adaptive diversification of growth allometry in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana [Evolution]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3416.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1626893ee0e:63522ae:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/13/3416/F1.medium.gif</url><width>440</width><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>238</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3416</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3416.short?rss=1</originId><published>1522168915000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fdaa9362</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3416.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Seed plants vary tremendously in size and morphology; however, variation and covariation in plant traits may be governed, at least in part, by universal biophysical laws and biological constants.

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke patients with active cancer frequently experience early neurological deterioration (END); however, the predictors of END are not well studied. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has recently been described as a predictor of poor outcomes in cancer and stroke. However, its role in cancer-related stroke has not been addressed.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;We aimed to evaluate the association between the NLR and END in cancer-related stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We included 85 cryptogenic stroke patients with active cancer. END was defined as an increase ≥ 4 on the total National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score within 72 hours of admission. The NLR was calculated as the ratio of the absolute neutrophil count to the absolute lymphocyte count. We obtained the NLR during the following three periods: at admission, 1–3 days after admission (D 1–3 NLR) and 4–7 days after admission (D 4–7 NLR).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;END occurred in 15 (18%) of the 85 patients. END was significantly associated with the initial NIHSS score, infarction volume, and the D 1–3 NLR. In multivariate analysis, a higher D 1–3 NLR, measured before END events, remained an independent predictor of END [adjusted odds ratio = 2.78, 95% confidence interval = 1.09–7.08, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.032]. In terms of temporal changes in the NLR, the END group showed a tendency toward temporal increase in the NLR at D 1–3 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.061) with subsequent decrements in the D 4–7 NLR (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.088), while the non-END group showed no significant changes in the NLR between periods.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study demonstrated that a higher NLR could predict END events in cryptogenic stroke patients with active cancer.

Tristan da Cunha Islands, an archipelago of four rocky volcanic islands situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and part of the United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), present a rare example of a relatively unimpacted temperate marine ecosystem. We conducted the first quantitative surveys of nearshore kelp forests, offshore pelagic waters and deep sea habitats. Kelp forests had very low biodiversity and species richness, but high biomass and abundance of those species present. Spatial variation in assemblage structure for both nearshore fish and invertebrates/algae was greatest between the three northern islands and the southern island of Gough, where sea temperatures were on average 3-4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; colder. Despite a lobster fishery that provides the bulk of the income to the Tristan islands, lobster abundance and biomass are comparable to or greater than many Marine Protected Areas in other parts of the world. Pelagic camera surveys documented a rich biodiversity offshore, including large numbers of juvenile blue sharks, &lt;i&gt;Prionace glauca&lt;/i&gt;. Species richness and abundance in the deep sea is positively related to hard rocky substrate and biogenic habitats such as sea pens, crinoids, whip corals, and gorgonians were present at 40% of the deep camera deployments. We observed distinct differences in the deep fish community above and below ~750 m depth. Concurrent oceanographic sampling showed a discontinuity in temperature and salinity at this depth. While currently healthy, Tristan’s marine ecosystem is not without potential threats: shipping traffic leading to wrecks and species introductions, pressure to increase fishing effort beyond sustainable levels and the impacts of climate change all could potentially increase in the coming years. The United Kingdom has committed to protection of marine environments across the UKOTs, including Tristan da Cunha and these results can be used to inform future management decisions as well as provide a baseline against which future monitoring can be based.</content></content><author><name>Jennifer E.

Transfer entropy from non-uniform embedding is a popular tool for the inference of causal relationships among dynamical subsystems. In this study we present an approach that makes use of low-dimensional conditional mutual information quantities to decompose the original high-dimensional conditional mutual information in the searching procedure of non-uniform embedding for significant variables at different lags. We perform a series of simulation experiments to assess the sensitivity and specificity of our proposed method to demonstrate its advantage compared to previous algorithms. The results provide concrete evidence that low-dimensional approximations can help to improve the statistical accuracy of transfer entropy in multivariate causality analysis and yield a better performance over other methods.

Worldwide tree mortality as induced by climate change presents a challenge to forest managers. To successfully manage vulnerable forests requires the capacity of regeneration to compensate for losses from tree mortality. We observed rapid regeneration and the growth release of young trees after warming-induced mortality in a David aspen-dominated (&lt;i&gt;Populus davidiana&lt;/i&gt;) broad-leaved forest in Inner Mongolia, China, as based on individual tree measurements taken in 2012 and 2015 from a 6-ha permanent plot. Warming and drought stress killed large trees 10–15 m tall with a total number of 2881 trees during 2011–2012, and also thinned the upper crowns. David aspen recruitment increased 2 times during 2012–2015 and resulted in a high transition probability of David aspen replacing the same or other species, whereas the recruitment of Mongolian oak (&lt;i&gt;Quercus mongolica&lt;/i&gt;) was much lower: it decreased from 2012 to 2015, indicating that rapid regeneration represented a regrowth phase for David aspen, and not succession to Mongolian oak. Further, we found that the recruitment density increased with canopy openness, thus implying that warming-induced mortality enhanced regeneration. Our results suggest that David aspen has a high regrowth ability to offset individual losses from warming-induced mortality. This important insight has implications for managing this vulnerable forest in the semi-arid region of northern China.</content></content><author><name>Pengwu Zhao</name></author><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pengwu Zhao, Chongyang Xu, Mei Zhou, Bo Zhang, Peng Ge, Nan Zeng, Hongyan Liu&lt;/p&gt;

This important insight has implications for managing this vulnerable forest in the semi-arid region of northern China.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>B1-B2 phase transition mechanism and pathway of PbS under pressure</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010381?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1622364c343:d035f:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010381?af=R</originId><published>1520577130000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f30ec1e2</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010381?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/10&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 10&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>Adebayo A.

Understanding the relationship between external stimuli and the spiking activity of cortical populations is a central problem in neuroscience. Dense recurrent connectivity in local cortical circuits can lead to counterintuitive response properties, raising the question of whether there are simple arithmetical rules for relating circuits’ connectivity structure to their response properties. One such arithmetic is provided by the mean field theory of balanced networks, which is derived in a limit where excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents precisely balance on average. However, balanced network theory is not applicable to some biologically relevant connectivity structures. We show that cortical circuits with such structure are susceptible to an amplification mechanism arising when excitatory-inhibitory balance is broken at the level of local subpopulations, but maintained at a global level. This amplification, which can be quantified by a linear correction to the classical mean field theory of balanced networks, explains several response properties observed in cortical recordings and provides fundamental insights into the relationship between connectivity structure and neural responses in cortical circuits.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FNF84rL9qos&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Christopher Ebsch</name></author><crawled>1521136577476</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher Ebsch, Robert Rosenbaum&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Traffic accidents are associated with the visual function of drivers, as well as many other factors. Driving simulator systems have the advantage of controlling for traffic- and automobile-related conditions, and using pinhole glasses can control the degree of concentric concentration of the visual field. We evaluated the effect of concentric constriction of the visual field on automobile driving, using driving simulator tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subjects meeting criteria for normal eyesight were included in the study. Pinhole glasses with variable aperture sizes were adjusted to mimic the conditions of concentric visual field constrictions of 10° and 15°, using a CLOCK CHART&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. The test contained 8 scenarios (2 oncoming right-turning cars and 6 jump-out events from the side).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighty-eight subjects were included in the study; 37 (mean age = 52.9±15.8 years) subjects were assigned to the 15° group, and 51 (mean = 48.6±15.5 years) were assigned to the 10° group. For all 8 scenarios, the number of accidents was significantly higher among pinhole wearing subjects. The average number of all types of accidents per person was significantly higher in the pinhole 10° group (4.59±1.81) than the pinhole 15° group (3.68±1.49) (P = 0.032). The number of accidents associated with jump-out scenarios, in which a vehicle approaches from the side on a straight road with a good view, was significantly higher in the pinhole 10° group than in the pinhole 15° group.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Concentric constriction of the visual field was associated with increased number of traffic accidents.

Background &lt;p&gt;The burden of medically-attended acute gastro-enteritis (MA-AGE) that can be attributed to norovirus is not well established in Japan. Using a nationwide database of medical care insurance claims, we estimated the incidence of medically-attended norovirus-attributable gastroenteritis (MA-NGE) in Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The incidences of MA-NGE outpatient consultations or hospitalization in Japan were modelled on seasonal patterns of MA-AGE for unspecified causes derived from the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC) database for the period July 2007 to June 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age-adjusted annual incidence rates (per 10,000 person-years) of MA-NGE associated with outpatient care or hospitalization were 389 (95% CI 269–558) and 13 (95% CI 9–20), respectively. Highest rates were in children under 5 years of age: 1,569 (95% CI 1,325–1,792) for outpatient consultations and 48 (95% CI 39–56) for hospitalizations. Of all gastroenteritis episodes associated with outpatient care or hospitalization, 29% and 31% were attributed to norovirus, respectively. Norovirus was estimated to be responsible for 4,964,000 outpatient visits (95% CI 3,435,000–7,123,000) and 171,000 hospitalizations (95% CI 110,000–251,000) per year across Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Incidence rates of MA-AGE are high in Japan, and norovirus-attributable disease is at least as high as in some other developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Chia-Hsien Chang</name></author><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chia-Hsien Chang, Motonobu Sakaguchi, John Weil, Thomas Verstraeten&lt;/p&gt;

One of the more fundamental health policy questions is the relationship between health care quality and spending. A better understanding of these relationships is needed to inform health systems interventions aimed at increasing quality and efficiency of care. We measured 65 validated quality indicators (QI) across Ontario physician networks. QIs were aggregated into domains representing six dimensions of care: screening and prevention, evidence-based medications, hospital-community transitions (7-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician; 30-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician and specialist), potentially avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable readmissions and unplanned returns to the ED, and poor cancer end of life care. Each domain rate was computed as a weighted average of QI rates, weighting by network population at risk. We also measured overall and sector-specific per capita healthcare network spending. We evaluated the associations between domain rates, and between domain rates and spending using weighted correlations, weighting by network population at risk, using an ecological design. All indicators were measured using Ontario health administrative databases. Large variations were seen in timely hospital-community transitions and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Networks with timely hospital-community transitions had lower rates of avoidable admissions and readmissions (r = -0.89, -0.58, respectively). Higher physician spending, especially outpatient primary care spending, was associated with lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations (r = -0.83) and higher rates of timely hospital-community transitions (r = 0.81) and moderately associated with lower readmission rates (r = -0.46). Investment in effective primary care services may help reduce burden on the acute care sector and associated expenditures.</content></content><author><name>Farah Rahman</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Farah Rahman, Jun Guan, Richard H.

Within the human host, the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; is exposed to multiple selection pressures. The host environment changes dramatically in severe malaria, but the extent to which the parasite responds to—or is selected by—this environment remains unclear. From previous studies, the parasites that cause severe malaria appear to increase expression of a restricted but poorly defined subset of the PfEMP1 variant, surface antigens. PfEMP1s are major targets of protective immunity. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyse gene expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients. The transcriptomes of 19 parasite isolates associated with severe malaria indicated that these parasites had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and probably transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation; reduced surface expression of PfEMP1; and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins. Our RNAseq also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments and also confirmed all previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and severe disease. These findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and also indicate how parasites adapt to—or are selected by—the host environment in severe malaria.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rNZ95HC-F9Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Gerry Q.

&lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; formation of epithelial cell-cell contacts relies on actin-based protrusions as well as tightly controlled turnover of junctional actin once cells encounter each other and adhesion complexes assemble. The specific contributions of individual actin regulators on either protrusion formation or junctional actin turnover remain largely unexplored. Based on our previous findings of Formin-like 2 (FMNL2)-mediated control of junctional actin dynamics, we investigated its potential role in membrane protrusions and impact on newly forming epithelial contacts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of FMNL2 in human MCF10A cells combined with optogenetic control of Rac1 activity confirmed its critical function in the establishment of intercellular contacts.

&lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; formation of epithelial cell-cell contacts relies on actin-based protrusions as well as tightly controlled turnover of junctional actin once cells encounter each other and adhesion complexes assemble. The specific contributions of individual actin regulators on either protrusion formation or junctional actin turnover remain largely unexplored. Based on our previous findings of Formin-like 2 (FMNL2)-mediated control of junctional actin dynamics, we investigated its potential role in membrane protrusions and impact on newly forming epithelial contacts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of FMNL2 in human MCF10A cells combined with optogenetic control of Rac1 activity confirmed its critical function in the establishment of intercellular contacts. While lamellipodial protrusion rates remained unaffected, FMNL2 knockout cells were characterized by impaired filopodia formation similar to depletion of the Rho GTPase Cdc42. Silencing of Cdc42, however, failed to affect FMNL2-mediated contact formation. Hence, we propose a cell-cell contact-specific and Rac1-mediated function of FMNL2 entirely independent of Cdc42. Consistent with this, direct visualizations of native epithelial junction formation revealed a striking and specifically Rac1- and not Cdc42-dependent recruitment of FMNL2 to newly forming junctions as well as established cell-cell contacts within epithelial sheets.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01622</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Fragment-Based Approach to Targeting Inosine-5&apos;-monophosphate Dehydrogenase (IMPDH) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01622</link><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_162547eb16b:489fcc:bdf8aaf1</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01622/20180323/images/medium/jm-2017-016229_0015.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>133</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01622</originId><crawled>1521836011883</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fd1fb897</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01622/20180323/images/medium/jm-2017-016229_0015.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01622&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The folding of proteins with a complex knot is still an unresolved question. Based on representative members of Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolases (UCHs) that contain the 5&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knot in the native state, we explain how UCHs are able to unfold and refold &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; reversibly within the structure-based model. In particular, we identify two, topologically different folding/unfolding pathways and corroborate our results with experiment, recreating the chevron plot. We show that confinement effect of chaperonin or weak crowding greatly facilitates folding, simultaneously slowing down the unfolding process of UCHs, compared with bulk conditions. Finally, we analyze the existence of knots in the denaturated state of UCHs. The results of the work show that the crowded environment of the cell should have a positive effect on the kinetics of complex knotted proteins, especially when proteins with deeper knots are found in this family.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IQnzANgGzpM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yani Zhao</name></author><crawled>1521222945837</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yani Zhao, Pawel Dabrowski-Tumanski, Szymon Niewieczerzal, Joanna I.

Although significant attention has been devoted to analyzing stigma associated with epilepsy, there is still a significant lack of valid and reliable instruments. We aimed to validate the 23-item Czech version of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE; originally developed in Brazil), which has been used to evaluate epilepsy-related stigma in the general population. Verification of the SSE questionnaire was carried out in a group of 207 students aged 15–18 years of whom none had epilepsy. These students completed the SSE twice in a period of 3–6 months as part of standard test-retest evaluation practice. The instrument exhibits good psychometric properties including internal consistency higher than in the original version (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.856 here compared with 0.81 reported in Brazil) and acceptable test-retest reliability. Using exploratory factor analysis (not provided for the original version), four factors were identified and corresponding subscales were described and interpreted. Two items did not fit into the structure and were eliminated. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to propose and verify the hierarchical 4-factor structure of the Czech version of SSE confirming the existence of a common factor corresponding to stigma. The results showed that the Czech version of SSE has good psychometric properties and can be used in further research and clinical practice.</content></content><author><name>Dana Brabcová</name></author><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dana Brabcová, Jiří Kohout, Daniel Potužák, Barbora Beňová, Pavel Kršek&lt;/p&gt;

To ascertain the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; regulatory, central functions of WNT10A, we examined the net effects of WNT10A depletion using &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice (&lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We generated &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;mice, displaying a range of unique phenotypes of morpho/organogenetic failure, such as growth retardation, alopecia, kyphosis and infertility, and then focused on the functions of WNT10A in wound healing. We subjected C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) or &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;mice to skin ulcer formation. The &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;mice had significantly larger injured areas and delayed wound healing, which were associated with (a) a smaller number of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and microvessels; and (b) more reduced expression and synthesis of collagen, compared with WT mice with intact WNT10A expression, especially in those with activated myofibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These observations indicate that WNT10A signaling can play a pivotal in vivo role in wound healing by regulating the expression and synthesis of collagen, as one of fibrogenic factors, at least in part, and critical &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; roles of WNT10A-mediated effective wound healing are extremely closely associated with collagen expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Ke-Yong Wang</name></author><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ke-Yong Wang, Sohsuke Yamada, Hiroto Izumi, Manabu Tsukamoto, Tamiji Nakashima, Takashi Tasaki, Xin Guo, Hidetaka Uramoto, Yasuyuki Sasaguri, Kimitoshi Kohno&lt;/p&gt;

Black locust (&lt;i&gt;Robinia pseudoacacia&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an easy to raise, fast growing, medium-sized deciduous tree species highly tolerant to harsh eco-conditions, i.e., drought and harsh winters, and it is widely adaptable to sandy, loamy, and marshy soils. The basis for this adaptability remains to be investigated at the transcriptomic level using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Selection of a reliable gene for the normalization of qPCR data is important for obtaining accurate results in gene expression. The goal of this study was to identify an appropriate reference gene from 12 candidate genes for gene expression analysis in black locust exposed to various stressors such as abscisic acid (ABA), NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and varying temperatures. In GeNorm and NormFinder analyses, &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; (actin) and &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene expression were the most stable in all conditions except heat stress, but in BestKeeper analysis, &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;helicase&lt;/i&gt; gene expression were the most stable under NaCl and heat stress. In contrast, &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; were highest under abscisic acid (ABA), &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;βTUB&lt;/i&gt; (beta tubulin) under cold stress, and &lt;i&gt;helicase&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EF1α&lt;/i&gt; (elongation factor 1 alpha) under PEG stress. We found that the most stable reference gene combination for all conditions was &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, the expression pattern of &lt;i&gt;NAC2&lt;/i&gt; (a transcription factor) and &lt;i&gt;BGL2&lt;/i&gt; in different tissues and under different stress conditions was analyzed relative to &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;UBQ&lt;/i&gt; (ubiquitin) the least stably expressed gene. &lt;i&gt;NAC2 and BGL2&lt;/i&gt; both had highest expression in flowers and pods under ABA stress at 48h.

Further, a transcriptome pattern associated with longevity is reinforced in NMR breeders contradicting the disposable soma theory of aging and potentially contributing to their exceptional long life- and healthspan.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03391-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Surface tension-assisted additive manufacturing</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03391-w</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1624d3d0584:3d95f2a:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-03391-w/MediaObjects/41467_2018_3391_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>514</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03391-w</originId><published>1521702000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6cf70a99</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/hwxCxRgIDik/s41467-018-03391-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surface tension-assisted additive manufacturing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surface tension-assisted additive manufacturing, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03391-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03391-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Integrating cell-laden hydrogels effectively into the 3D printing process is a challenge in the creation of tissue engineering scaffolds.

Performance-based financing (PBF) schemes have been expanding rapidly across low and middle income countries in the past decade, with considerable external financing from multilateral, bilateral and global health initiatives. Many of these countries have been fragile and conflict-affected (FCAS), but while the influence of context is acknowledged to be important to the operation of PBF, there has been little examination of how it affects adoption and implementation of PBF. This article lays out initial hypotheses about how FCAS contexts may influence the adoption, adaption, implementation and health system effects of PBF. These are then interrogated through a review of available grey and published literature (140 documents in total, covering 23 PBF schemes). We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</content></content><author><name>Maria Paola Bertone</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Paola Bertone, Jean-Benoît Falisse, Giuliano Russo, Sophie Witter&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We examine to what extent the effect of early-life conditions (health and socioeconomic status) on health in later life is mediated by educational attainment and life-course trajectories (fertility, partnership, employment).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 12,034), we apply, separately by gender, multichannel sequence analysis and cluster analysis to obtain groups of similar family and employment histories. The KHB method is used to disentangle direct and indirect effects of early-life conditions on health.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Early-life-conditions indirectly impact on health in later life as result of their influence on education and family and employment trajectories. For example, between 22% and 42% of the effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Even higher percentages are found for men (35% - 57%). On the contrary, the positive effect of poor health at childhood on poor health at older ages is not significantly mediated by education and life-course trajectories. Education captures most of the mediating effect of parental socio-economic status. More specifically, between 66% and 75% of the indirect effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Again, higher percentages are found for men (86% - 93%). Early-life conditions, especially socioeconomic status, influence family and employment trajectories indirectly through their impact on education. We also find a persistent direct impact of early-life conditions on health at older ages.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate that early-life experiences influence education and life-course trajectories and health in later life, suggesting that public investments in children are expected to produce long lasting effects on people’s lives throughout the different phases of their life-course.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Bruno Arpino</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Arpino, Jordi Gumà, Albert Julià&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Linkage to and retention in care for US persons living with HIV (PLWH) after release from jail usually declines. We know of no rigorously evaluated behavioral interventions that can improve this. We hypothesized that a strengths-based case management intervention that we developed for PLWH leaving jail would increase linkage/retention in care (indicated by receipt of laboratory draws) and a suppressed HIV viral load (VL) in the year following release.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We conducted a quasi-experimental feasibility study of our intervention for PLWH jailed in Atlanta. We recruited 113 PLWH in jail starting in 2014. “SUCCESS” (Sustained, Unbroken Connection to Care, Entry Services, and Suppression) began in jail and continued post-release. Subjects who started the intervention but subsequently began long-term incarcerations were excluded from further analysis. Persons who were retained in the intervention group were compared to contemporaneously incarcerated PLWH who did not receive the intervention. Identities were submitted to an enhanced HIV/AIDS reporting system (eHARS) at the state health department to capture all laboratories drawn. Both community engagement and care upon jail return were assessed equally. For 44 intervention participants released to Atlanta, 50% of care occurred on subsequent jail stays, as documented with EventFlow software. Forty-five receiving usual services only were recruited for comparison. By examining records of jail reentries, half of participants and 60% of controls recidivated (range: 1–8 returns). All but 6 participants in the intervention and 9 subjects in the comparison arm had ≥1 laboratory recorded in eHARS post-release.

Our results demonstrate the utility of automated spatiotemporal alignments of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryos, and uncover key principles guiding nervous-system development in this animal.</description></item><item><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25167?af=R</link><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626555968b:6ce05:76251cdd</id><unread>False</unread><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25167?af=R</originId><published>1522118530699</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>23f7b56d</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25167?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1522118530699</crawled></item><item><engagement>320</engagement><title>Complex behavior arose at dawn of humans</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1200?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d2514c:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6381/1200.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1200?rss=1</originId><crawled>1521143966531</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Anthropology, Evolution</item></keywords><fingerprint>36258be</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1200?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Gibbons, A.</name></author><published>1521135592000</published></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002864</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>81</engagement><title>Autophagy is essential for maintaining the growth of a human (mini-)organ: Evidence from scalp hair follicle organ culture</title><recrawled>1523381048368</recrawled><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002864</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1626db778eb:4248d4:bdf8aaf1</id><updated>1522270800000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002864</originId><published>1522270800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e04b4211</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/VVncDRle7Ww/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chiara Parodi, Jonathan A.

Autophagy plays a crucial role in health and disease, regulating central cellular processes such as adaptive stress responses, differentiation, tissue development, and homeostasis. However, the role of autophagy in human physiology is poorly understood, highlighting a need for a model human organ system to assess the efficacy and safety of strategies to therapeutically modulate autophagy. As a complete, cyclically remodelled (mini-)organ, the organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs), which, after massive growth (anagen), spontaneously enter into an apoptosis-driven organ involution (catagen) process, may provide such a model. Here, we reveal that in anagen, hair matrix keratinocytes (MKs) of organ-cultured HFs exhibit an active autophagic flux, as documented by evaluation of endogenous lipidated Light Chain 3B (LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) proteins and the ultrastructural visualization of autophagosomes at all stages of the autophagy process. This autophagic flux is altered during catagen, and genetic inhibition of autophagy promotes catagen development. Conversely, an anti–hair loss product markedly enhances intrafollicular autophagy, leading to anagen prolongation. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role of autophagy in human hair growth. Moreover, we show that organ-cultured scalp HFs are an excellent preclinical research model for exploring the role of autophagy in human tissue physiology and for evaluating the efficacy and tissue toxicity of candidate autophagy-modulatory agents in a living human (mini-)organ.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VVncDRle7Ww&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Chiara Parodi</name></author><crawled>1522259163371</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chiara Parodi, Jonathan A.

Moreover, the oil also has cytoprotective activity probably because of its ability to inhibit the action of free radicals.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Pisces: An Accurate and Versatile Variant Caller for Somatic and Germline Next-Generation Sequencing Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291641v1?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162736a0cb4:749f4ad:34f43e70</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/29/291641</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291641v1?rss=1</originId><published>1522306800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><fingerprint>287ec11d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291641v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology is transitioning quickly from research labs to clinical settings.

Hypovitaminosis D has been extensively documented in critically ill humans. However, whether or not critically ill dogs have alterations in vitamin D concentrations remains unconfirmed. The primary aims of our study were to compare serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D] concentrations in critically ill dogs with healthy control dogs, determine the prognostic utility of serum 25(OH)D concentration as a biomarker in critically ill dogs, and to assess if serum 25(OH)D concentrations in critically ill dogs are associated with length of stay in the intensive care unit or illness severity. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D together with a range of other clinical, biochemical, and hematological parameters, were measured in 99 dogs within 24 hours of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Critically ill dogs (P = 0.001) and dogs with sepsis (P = 0.002) had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy control dogs. In addition, serum 25(OH)D concentration was an independent predictor of in-hospital and 30 day survival. Using a cut-off of 33 ng/mL, serum 25(OH)D concentrations had excellent sensitivity (0.94; 95% CI, 0.71–1.00), but poor specificity (0.41; 95% CI, 0.31–0.53) for detection of survival. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLE) fast score but were not associated with ICU length of stay. Hospitalized dogs with critical illness have decreased serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy dogs and can be used to predict survival in this cohort.</content></content><author><name>Jared A.

Background &lt;p&gt;A large number of programs have been implemented in many countries to increase the healthcare workforce recruitment in rural and remote areas. Rural early exposure programs for medical students have been shown to be effective strategies. However, no related studies have been reported before in China. This study was carried out to determine the association between medical students’ participation in rural clinical clerkships and their intentions to choose rural medical work after graduation from western medical schools in China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Based on a two-stage random sampling method, the cross-sectional survey was carried out in ten western provinces in China. A brief questionnaire filled in by medical students was used for data collection. A total of 4278 medical students participated in the study. The response rate was approximately 90.34%. Pearson’s chi-squared tests and binary logistic regression analyses were performed for data analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Approximately 52.0% of medical students disclosed intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation. Only one in five participants had experience with a rural clinical clerkship. Rural clinical clerkships were significantly associated with medical students’ intentions to work in rural medical institutions (OR: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.05–1.46); further analyses indicated that such clerkships only had a significant impact among the medical students with an urban background (OR: 2.10, 95%CI: 1.48–2.97). In terms of the sociodemographic characteristics, younger age, low level of parental education, majoring in general practice, and studying in low-level medical schools increased the odds of having intentions to engage in rural medical work among medical students; however, rural origins was the only positive univariate predictor. In addition, the predictors of intentions to choose rural medical work were different between medical students with a rural background and those with an urban background.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rural clinical clerkship is likely to increase the odds of having intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation among medical students in western China, especially for those with an urban background. Related policy makers could consider developing compulsory rural clerkship programs and implement them among medical students to increase early rural exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jinlin Liu</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinlin Liu, Bin Zhu, Ying Mao&lt;/p&gt;

Metagenomics is a powerful tool for characterizing viral composition within environmental samples, but sample and molecular processing steps can bias the estimation of viral community structure. The objective of this study is to understand the inherent variability introduced when conducting viral metagenomic analyses of wastewater and provide a bioinformatic strategy to accurately analyze sequences for viral community analyses. A standard approach using a combination of ultrafiltration, membrane filtration, and DNase treatment, and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) produced DNA preparations without any bacterial derived genes. Results showed recoveries in wastewater matrix ranged between 60–100%. A bias towards small single stranded DNA (ssDNA; polyomavirus) virus types vs larger double stranded DNA (dsDNA; adenovirus) viruses was also observed with a total estimated recovery of small circular viruses to be as much as 173-fold higher. Notably, ssDNA abundance decreased with sample dilution while large dsDNA genomes (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Caudovirales&lt;/i&gt;) initially increased in abundance with dilution before gradually decreasing with further dilution in wastewater samples. The present study revealed the inherent biases associated with different components of viral metagenomic methods applied to wastewater. Overall, these results provide a well-characterized approach for effectively conducting viral metagenomics analysis of wastewater and reveal that dilution can effectively mitigate MDA bias.</content></content><author><name>Nichole E.

The aim of this study was to characterize the urine metabolome of women with &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT) uro-genital infection (n = 21), comparing it with a group of CT-negative subjects (n = 98). By means of a proton-based nuclear magnetic resonance (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR) spectroscopy, we detected and quantified the urine metabolites of a cohort of 119 pre-menopausal Caucasian women, attending a STI Outpatients Clinic in Italy. In case of a CT positive result, CT molecular genotyping was performed by &lt;i&gt;omp1&lt;/i&gt; gene semi-nested PCR followed by RFLP analysis. We were able to identify several metabolites whose concentrations were significantly higher in the urine samples of CT-positive subjects, including sucrose, mannitol, pyruvate and lactate. In contrast, higher urinary levels of acetone represented the main feature of CT-negative women.
These results were not influenced by the age of patients nor by the CT serovars (D, E, F, G, K) responsible of the urethral infections. Since the presence of sugars can increase the stability of chlamydial proteins, higher levels of sucrose and mannitol in the urethral lumen, related to a higher sugar consumption, could have favoured CT infection acquisition or could have been of aid for the bacterial viability. Peculiar dietary habits of the subjects enrolled, in term of type and amount of food consumed, could probably explain these findings. Lactate and pyruvate could result from CT-induced immunopathology, as a product of the inflammatory microenvironment.

Meta-research is the study of research itself: its methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives. Given that science is the key driver of human progress, improving the efficiency of scientific investigation and yielding more credible and more useful research results can translate to major benefits. The research enterprise grows very fast. Both new opportunities for knowledge and innovation and new threats to validity and scientific integrity emerge. Old biases abound, and new ones continuously appear as novel disciplines emerge with different standards and challenges.

Meta-research is the study of research itself: its methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives. Given that science is the key driver of human progress, improving the efficiency of scientific investigation and yielding more credible and more useful research results can translate to major benefits. The research enterprise grows very fast. Both new opportunities for knowledge and innovation and new threats to validity and scientific integrity emerge. Old biases abound, and new ones continuously appear as novel disciplines emerge with different standards and challenges. Meta-research uses an interdisciplinary approach to study, promote, and defend robust science. Major disruptions are likely to happen in the way we pursue scientific investigation, and it is important to ensure that these disruptions are evidence based.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oooAXQ5WXhg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00029</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Optical and Structural Characterization of a Chronic Myeloid Leukemia DNA Biosensor</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00029</link><id>ofNPcmQ46PpGzt1nO49W9STAvkUsM7jssLxNXMp09ME=_16254922a23:4a5012:bdf8aaf1</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00029/20180323/images/medium/cb-2018-00029s_0005.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>323</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00029</originId><crawled>1521837287971</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId></origin><fingerprint>736d552</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00029/20180323/images/medium/cb-2018-00029s_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00029&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

A heterozygous mutation in the Wolfram syndrome type 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;WFS1&lt;/i&gt;) causes autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hereditary hearing loss, DFNA6/14/38, or Wolfram-like syndrome. To date, more than 40 different mutations have been reported to be responsible for DFNA6/14/38. In the present study, &lt;i&gt;WFS1&lt;/i&gt; variants were screened in a large series of Japanese hearing loss (HL) patients to clarify the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DFNA6/14/38 and Wolfram-like syndrome. Massively parallel DNA sequencing of 68 target genes was performed in 2,549 unrelated Japanese HL patients to identify genomic variations responsible for HL. The detailed clinical features in patients with &lt;i&gt;WFS1&lt;/i&gt; variants were collected from medical charts and analyzed. We successfully identified 13 &lt;i&gt;WFS1&lt;/i&gt; variants in 19 probands: eight of the 13 variants were previously reported mutations, including three mutations (p.A684V, p.K836N, and p.E864K) known to cause Wolfram-like syndrome, and five were novel mutations. Variants were detected in 15 probands (2.5%) in 602 families with presumably autosomal dominant or mitochondrial HL, and in four probands (0.7%) in 559 sporadic cases; however, no variants were detected in the other 1,388 probands with autosomal recessive or unknown family history. Among the 30 individuals possessing variants, marked variations were observed in the onset of HL as well as in the presence of progressive HL and tinnitus. Vestibular symptoms, which had been rarely reported, were present in 7 out of 30 (23%) of the affected individuals. The most prevalent audiometric configuration was low-frequency type; however, some individuals had high-frequency HL. Haplotype analysis in three mutations (p.A716T, p.K836T, and p.E864K) suggested that the mutations occurred at these mutation hot spots. The present study provided new insights into the audiovestibular phenotypes in patients with &lt;i&gt;WFS1&lt;/i&gt; mutations.</content></content><author><name>Masafumi Kobayashi</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masafumi Kobayashi, Maiko Miyagawa, Shin-ya Nishio, Hideaki Moteki, Taro Fujikawa, Kenji Ohyama, Hirofumi Sakaguchi, Ikuyo Miyanohara, Akiko Sugaya, Yasushi Naito, Shin-ya Morita, Yukihiko Kanda, Masahiro Takahashi, Kotaro Ishikawa, Yuki Nagano, Tetsuya Tono, Chie Oshikawa, Chiharu Kihara, Haruo Takahashi, Yoshihiro Noguchi, Shin-ichi Usami&lt;/p&gt;

Tuberculosis places a staggering burden on human health globally. The new World Health Organisation End-TB Strategy has highlighted the urgent need for more effective TB vaccines to improve control of the disease. Protein-based subunit vaccines offer potential as safe and effective generators of protective immunity, and the use of particulate vaccine formulation and delivery by the pulmonary route may enhance local immunogenicity. In this study, novel particulate subunit vaccines were developed utilising biodegradable poly(lactic-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycolic acid) (PLGA) slow-release particles as carriers for the &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; lipoprotein MPT83, together with the adjuvants trehalose-dibehenate (TDB) or Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Following delivery by the pulmonary or subcutaneous routes, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these vaccines were assessed in a murine model of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection. When delivered peripherally, these vaccines induced modest, antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 responses, but strong anti-MPT83 antibody responses. Mucosal delivery of the PLGA(MPT83) vaccine, with or without TDB, increased antigen-specific Th17 responses in the lungs, however, PLGA-encapsulated vaccines did not provide protection against &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; challenge. By contrast, peripheral delivery of DDA liposomes containing MPT83 and TDB or MPL, stimulated both Th1 and Th17 responses and generated protection against &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; challenge. Therefore, PLGA-formulated vaccines primarily stimulate strong humoral immunity, or Th17 responses if used mucosally, and may be a suitable carrier for vaccines against extracellular pathogens. This study emphasises the critical nature of the vaccine carrier, adjuvant and route of delivery for optimising vaccine efficacy against TB.</content></content><author><name>Anneliese S.

This study emphasises the critical nature of the vaccine carrier, adjuvant and route of delivery for optimising vaccine efficacy against TB.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00204</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Cystamine and Disulfiram Inhibit Human Transglutaminase 2 via an Oxidative Mechanism</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00204</link><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_1626d72a256:3b4263:bdf8aaf1</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00204/20180328/images/medium/bi-2018-00204r_0007.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>182</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00204</originId><crawled>1522254651990</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3124a5c1</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00204/20180328/images/medium/bi-2018-00204r_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00204&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Vaginal delivery has been recommended for more than ten years for women living with HIV (WLWH) with good virological control. However, in Europe most WLWH still deliver by cesarean section (CS). Our aim was to assess the rate of vaginal delivery and the indications for CS in WLWH over 20 years in a setting of low overall CS rate.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of all WLWH delivering in Finland 1993–2013. We identified the women by combining national health registers and extracted data from patient files.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study comprised 212 women with 290 deliveries. Over 35% of the women delivered several children during the study years. During 2000–2013, with consistent viral load monitoring, 80.0% showed HIV viral loads &amp;lt;50 copies/mL in the last measurement preceding the delivery. Altogether 74.5% of all WLWH delivered vaginally and the rate of both elective CS and emergency CS was 12.8% each. For most CSs (63.5%) the indication was obstetrical, for 28.4% it was avoiding HIV transmission and for 0.7% it was mother’s request. In hospitals with less than ten HIV-related deliveries during the study period, the rate of elective CS was higher than in more experienced hospitals (22.7% versus 10.6% [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024]).

Background &lt;p&gt;Current South African health policy for chronic disease management proposes integration of chronic services for better outcomes for chronic conditions; that is based on the Integrated Chronic Disease Model (ICDM). However, scant data exist on how patients with chronic multimorbidities currently experience the (re)-organisation of health services and what their perceived needs are in order to enhance the management of their conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A qualitative study was conducted in a community health centre treating both HIV and diabetes patients in Cape Town. The study was grounded in the Shippee&apos;s Cumulative Complexity Model (CCM) and explored “patient workload” and “patient capacity” to manage chronic conditions. Individual interviews were conducted with 10 adult patient-participants with HIV and type two diabetes (T2D) multimorbidity and 6 healthcare workers who provided health services to these patient-participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patient-participants in this study experienced clinic-related workload such as: two separate clinics for HIV and T2D and perceived and experienced power mismatch between patients and healthcare workers. Self-care related workloads were largely around nutritional requirements, pill burden, and stigma. Burden of these demands varied in difficulty among patient-participants due to capacity factors such as: positive attitudes, optimal health literacy, social support and availability of economic resources. Strategies mentioned by participants for improved continuity of care and self-management of multi-morbidities included integration of chronic services, consolidated guidelines for healthcare workers, educational materials for patients, improved information systems and income for patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Using the CCM to explore multimorbidity captured most of the themes around &amp;quot;patient workload&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;patient capacity”, and was thus a suitable framework to explore multimorbidity in this high HIV/T2D burden setting.

Several recent studies have claimed that rodents have good visual recognition abilities. However, the extent to which rats can recognize other rats and distinguish between males and females using visual information alone remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the ability of rats to visually recognize mirror, video-recorded, and still images and to discriminate between images of males and females. Rats were tested in a place preference apparatus with a mirror, a video-recorded image of a rat, or a still image of a rat at one end. The data were assessed using t-test with Bonferroni correction. Male and female rats spent significantly more time in the mirror chamber and the video-recorded image chamber than in their respective blank chambers (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and male rats also spent more time in the chamber containing a still image. Furthermore, it was found that male rats exhibited significantly more sniffing behavior around the mirror than in the blank chamber (P &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas female rats were no significant differences in the sniffing behaviors in the mirror, moving or still image experiments. Identical results were obtained regardless of whether the rat in the image was the same or opposite sex. These results indicate that rats can process the differences in mirror, video-recorded, and still images as visual information, but are unable to use this information to distinguish between the sexes.</content></content><author><name>Tomiko Yakura</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomiko Yakura, Hiroki Yokota, Yusuke Ohmichi, Mika Ohmichi, Takashi Nakano, Munekazu Naito&lt;/p&gt;

The risk of atrial fibrillation (AF)-related stroke is usually assessed by calculating the CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-VASc score, the components of which are various risk factors, including prior stroke. Although prior stroke is considered the strongest risk factor, the associated risk is actually inferred. Nevertheless, it implies a “freedom-from-event effect” (FEE)—the longer a patient is stroke-free, the lower the stroke risk. Although dynamic prognostication has been applied to cancer, the FEE has been ignored in AF, probably because of methodological difficulties. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the FEE in the risk of AF-related stroke. We modeled various populations of AF patients and simulated the development of stroke assuming a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, where the hazard depends on age, comorbidities, and individual variability. Parameters were set so that the model respects the CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-VASc scoring scheme and reproduces the 1-year CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-VASc score-wise stroke risk and relative risk conferred by real-world risk factors. We tracked stroke risk over 0 to 15 years of freedom-from-stroke time (FST), both prospective FST (pFST), which begins at the time of diagnosis and continues to the future, and retrospective FST (rFST), which begins at the present and looks backward to the time of diagnosis. The pFST counterbalanced the increase in stroke risk conferred by aging; in patients with a CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-VASc score of 1, the pFST offset 62% of the age-conferred risk increase. The rFST reduced the stroke risk; in patients with a CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-VASc score of 2 and without prior stroke, an rFST of 6.8 years reduced the stroke risk to the midpoint between CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-VASc scores 1 and 2.

Failure of this repression causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) due to mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 engineered chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) locus-specific proteomics to characterize D4Z4-associated proteins. These and other approaches identified the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) and Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1) complexes as necessary for DUX4 repression in human skeletal muscle cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Furthermore, DUX4-induced expression of MBD3L proteins partly relieved this repression in FSHD muscle cells.

Failure of this repression causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) due to mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 engineered chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) locus-specific proteomics to characterize D4Z4-associated proteins. These and other approaches identified the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) and Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1) complexes as necessary for DUX4 repression in human skeletal muscle cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Furthermore, DUX4-induced expression of MBD3L proteins partly relieved this repression in FSHD muscle cells. Together, these findings identify NuRD and CAF-1 as mediators of DUX4 chromatin repression and suggest a mechanism for the amplification of DUX4 expression in FSHD muscle cells.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00216</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Cooperative Interactions of Three Hotspot Heparin Binding Residues Are Critical for Allosteric Activation of Antithrombin by Heparin</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00216</link><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_16277bc9f0b:10eb56e:76251cdd</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00216/20180329/images/medium/bi-2018-00216x_0011.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>456</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00216</originId><crawled>1522427272971</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c0b42144</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00216/20180329/images/medium/bi-2018-00216x_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00216&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

However, it is unclear to what extent APA regulates these processes uniquely in specific cell types. Using a new technique, cTag-PAPERCLIP, we discovered significant differences in APA between the principal types of mouse cerebellar neurons, the Purkinje and granule cells, as well as between proliferating and differentiated granule cells. Transcripts that differed in APA in these comparisons were enriched in key neuronal functions and many differed in coding sequence in addition to 3&apos;UTR length. We characterize &lt;i&gt;Memo1&lt;/i&gt;, a transcript that shifted from expressing a short 3&apos;UTR isoform to a longer one during granule cell differentiation.

However, it is unclear to what extent APA regulates these processes uniquely in specific cell types. Using a new technique, cTag-PAPERCLIP, we discovered significant differences in APA between the principal types of mouse cerebellar neurons, the Purkinje and granule cells, as well as between proliferating and differentiated granule cells. Transcripts that differed in APA in these comparisons were enriched in key neuronal functions and many differed in coding sequence in addition to 3&apos;UTR length. We characterize &lt;i&gt;Memo1&lt;/i&gt;, a transcript that shifted from expressing a short 3&apos;UTR isoform to a longer one during granule cell differentiation.

Swarm-founding wasps are endemic and common representatives of neotropical fauna and compose an interesting social tribe of vespids, presenting both complex social characteristics and uncommon traits for a eusocial group, such as the absence of castes with distinct morphology. The paper wasp &lt;i&gt;Protonectarina sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; (Saussure) presents a broad distribution from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, occurring widespread in the Atlantic rainforest and arboreal Caatinga, being absent in the Amazon region. Given the peculiar distribution among swarm-founding wasps, an integrative approach to reconstruct the evolutionary history of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; in a spatial-temporal framework was performed to investigate: the presence of genetic structure and its relationship with the geography, the evolution of distinct morphologic lineages and the possible historical event(s) in Neotropical region, which could explain the observed phylogeographic pattern. Individuals of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; were obtained from populations of 16 areas throughout its distribution for DNA extraction and amplification of mitochondrial genes 12S, 16S and COI. Analysis of genetic diversity, construction of haplotype net, analysis of population structure and dating analysis of divergence time were performed. A morphometric analysis was also performed using 8 measures of the body of the adult (workers) to test if there are morphological distinction among populations. Thirty-five haplotypes were identified, most of them exclusively of a group and a high population structure was found. The possibility of genetic divergence because of isolation by distance was rejected. Morphological analysis pointed to a great uniformity in phenotypes, with only a small degree of differentiation between populations of south and the remaining. Divergence time analysis showed a Middle/Late Miocene origin, a period where an extensive marine ingression occurred in South America.

Inertial sensors offer the potential for integration into wireless virtual reality systems that allow the users to walk freely through virtual environments. However, owing to drift errors, inertial sensors cannot accurately estimate head and body orientations in the long run, and when walking indoors, this error cannot be corrected by magnetometers, due to the magnetic field distortion created by ferromagnetic materials present in buildings. This paper proposes a technique, called EHBD (Equalization of Head and Body Directions), to address this problem using two head- and shoulder-located magnetometers. Due to their proximity, their distortions are assumed to be similar and the magnetometer measurements are used to detect when the user is looking straight forward. Then, the system corrects the discrepancies between the estimated directions of the head and the shoulder, which are provided by gyroscopes and consequently are affected by drift errors. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of this technique in two tasks (navigation and navigation plus exploration) and using two different locomotion techniques: (1) gaze-directed mode (GD) in which the walking direction is forced to be the same as the head direction, and (2) decoupled direction mode (DD) in which the walking direction can be different from the viewing direction. The obtained results show that both locomotion modes show similar matching of the target path during the navigation task, while DD’s path matches the target path more closely than GD in the navigation plus exploration task. These results validate the EHBD technique especially when allowing different walking and viewing directions in the navigation plus exploration tasks, as expected. While the proposed method does not reach the accuracy of optical tracking (ideal case), it is an acceptable and satisfactory solution for users and is much more compact, portable and economical.</content></content><author><name>Ernesto de la Rubia</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto de la Rubia, Antonio Diaz-Estrella, Arcadio Reyes-Lecuona, Alyson Langley, Michael Brown, Sarah Sharples&lt;/p&gt;

How asymmetries in motor behavior become established normally or atypically in mammals remains unclear. An established model for motor asymmetry that is conserved across mammals can be obtained by experimentally inducing asymmetric striatal dopamine activity. However, the factors that can cause motor asymmetries in the absence of experimental manipulations to the brain remain unknown. Here, we show that mice with inner ear dysfunction display a robust left or right rotational preference, and this motor preference reflects an atypical asymmetry in cortico-striatal neurotransmission. By unilaterally targeting striatal activity with an antagonist of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a downstream integrator of striatal neurotransmitter signaling, we can reverse or exaggerate rotational preference in these mice. By surgically biasing vestibular failure to one ear, we can dictate the direction of motor preference, illustrating the influence of uneven vestibular failure in establishing the outward asymmetries in motor preference. The inner ear–induced striatal asymmetries identified here intersect with non–ear-induced asymmetries previously linked to lateralized motor behavior across species and suggest that aspects of left–right brain function in mammals can be ontogenetically influenced by inner ear input. Consistent with inner ear input contributing to motor asymmetry, we also show that, in humans with normal ear function, the motor-dominant hemisphere, measured as handedness, is ipsilateral to the ear with weaker vestibular input.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/t_G6MO4max4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Michelle W.

Acute stress responsiveness is a quantitative trait that varies in severity from one individual to another; however, the genetic component underlying the individual variation is largely unknown. Fischer 344 (F344) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat strains show large differences in behavioral responsiveness to acute stress, such as freezing behavior in response to footshock during the conditioning phase of contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for behavioral responsiveness to acute stress in the defensive burying (DB) and open field test (OFT) from a reciprocal F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cross of F344 and WKY rat strains. These included a significant QTL on chromosome 6 (&lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt;). Here, we hypothesized that the &lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt; region harbors genes with sequence variation(s) that contribute to differences in multiple behavioral response phenotypes between the F344 and WKY rat strains. To test this hypothesis, first we identified differentially expressed genes within the &lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt; QTL in the hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal cortex of F344 and WKY male rats using genome-wide microarray analyses. Genes with both expression differences and non-synonymous sequence variations in their coding regions were considered candidate quantitative trait genes (QTGs).

Acute stress responsiveness is a quantitative trait that varies in severity from one individual to another; however, the genetic component underlying the individual variation is largely unknown. Fischer 344 (F344) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat strains show large differences in behavioral responsiveness to acute stress, such as freezing behavior in response to footshock during the conditioning phase of contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for behavioral responsiveness to acute stress in the defensive burying (DB) and open field test (OFT) from a reciprocal F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cross of F344 and WKY rat strains. These included a significant QTL on chromosome 6 (&lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt;). Here, we hypothesized that the &lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt; region harbors genes with sequence variation(s) that contribute to differences in multiple behavioral response phenotypes between the F344 and WKY rat strains. To test this hypothesis, first we identified differentially expressed genes within the &lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt; QTL in the hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal cortex of F344 and WKY male rats using genome-wide microarray analyses. Genes with both expression differences and non-synonymous sequence variations in their coding regions were considered candidate quantitative trait genes (QTGs). As a proof-of-concept, the F344.WKY-&lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt; congenic strain was generated with the &lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt; WKY donor region into the F344 recipient strain. This congenic strain showed behavioral phenotypes similar to those of WKYs. Expression patterns of &lt;i&gt;Gpatch11&lt;/i&gt; (G-patch domain containing 11), &lt;i&gt;Cdkl4&lt;/i&gt; (Cyclin dependent kinase like 4), and &lt;i&gt;Drc1&lt;/i&gt; (Dynein regulatory complex subunit 1) paralleled that of WKY in the F344.WKY-&lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt; strain matching the behavioral profiles of WKY as opposed to F344 parental strains. We propose that these genes are candidate QTGs for behavioral responsiveness to acute stress.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Role of noise and parametric variation in the dynamics of gene regulatory circuits [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291153v1?rss=1</link><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16270766497:6ee6c1a:7d6c1c1c</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/28/291153</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291153v1?rss=1</originId><published>1522220400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b59ebd52</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291153v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Stochasticity in gene expression impacts the dynamics and functions of gene regulatory circuits.

Mulberry (&lt;i&gt;Morus alba&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an important economic tree species in many countries. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) has become a widely used method for gene expression studies in plants. A suitable reference gene is essential to ensure accurate and reliable results for qRT-PCR analyses. However, no reports describing the selection of reference genes have been published for mulberry. In this work, we evaluated the stability of twenty candidate reference genes in different plant tissues and under different stress conditions by qRT-PCR in mulberry using algorithms in two programs—geNorm and NormFinder. The results revealed that &lt;i&gt;TUB2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;UBI4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ACTIN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RPL4&lt;/i&gt; were ranked as the most stable reference genes in the samples subsets, whereas &lt;i&gt;EF1α4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TUB3&lt;/i&gt;showed the least stability with both algorithms.

The relationship between ABO blood groups (BG) and risk of incidence in cancers including gynecological cancers has been widely studied, showing increased incidence risk for BG A patients. As available data are inconsistent we investigated whether BG and their anti-glycan antibodies (anti-A and anti-B) have prognostic values in gynecological cancers. We retrospectively evaluated 974 patients with gynecological cancers in three cancer centers (Switzerland and Australia) between 1974 and 2014 regarding the relationships between clinico-pathological findings and the BG. Time to disease recurrence was significantly influenced by BG in patients with ovarian (n = 282) and vulvar (n = 67) cancer. BG O or B patients showed a significantly increased risk for ovarian cancer relapse compared to A, 59% and 82%, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.045; HR O vs A = 1.59 (CI 1.01–2.51) and (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036; HR A vs B = 0.55 (CI 0.32–0.96). Median time to relapse for advanced stage (n = 126) ovarian cancer patients was 18.2 months for BG O and 32.2 for A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031; HR O vs A = 2.07 (CI 1.07–4.02)). BG also significantly influenced relapse-free survival in patients with vulvar cancer (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), with BG O tending to have increased relapse risk compared to A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.089). Blood groups hence associate with recurrence in ovarian and vulvar cancer: women with BG O seem to have a lower ovarian cancer incidence, however are more likely to relapse earlier. The significance of the BG status as a prognostic value is evident and may be helpful to oncologists in prognosticating disease outcome and selecting the appropriate therapy.</content></content><author><name>Céline Montavon Sartorius</name></author><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Céline Montavon Sartorius, Andreas Schoetzau, Henriette Kettelhack, Daniel Fink, Neville F.

It should reduce effort and costs in finding and synthesising available research evidence, whilst efficiently focusing scant resources on contextually-relevant evidence-based guidance, and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>More on Crystal Formation (This Time With Proteins)</title><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13430</link><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_16296a89525:a48540f:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals.jpeg</url><width>700</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>796</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/05/more-on-crystal-formation-this-time-with-proteins</canonicalUrl><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13430</originId><published>1522945659000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Analytical Chemistry</item><item>Chemical News</item></keywords><fingerprint>a8333a5d</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>I realize that I was just talking about crystal formation here the other day, but there’s yet more news in the area, and it comes in the fiendishly difficult area of protein crystallography.

All you have to do to appreciate the horrors of this field is to step into a lab that does it for a living: stacks and stacks and stacks of plates, each with a slightly different set of conditions (buffers, concentrations, additives, protein construct, and son on) to try, once again, to get a protein crystal that diffracts well enough for structure determination. It’s especially tricky to get the ones with your small molecule sitting inside them at its binding site, but when you do, the payoffs can be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing such things at the quality levels needed, though, is an absolute black art. There are trends (sometimes), better ideas about starting points (sometimes), rational modifications of the protein sequence to increase your chances (sometimes), but in the end, it still comes down to relentless empirical try-it-and-see. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25971&quot;&gt;latest paper&lt;/a&gt; (writeup by &lt;em&gt;C&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i15/Cryo-electron-microscopy-reveals-protein.html?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=CEN&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is looking at a well-known protein crystal (glucose isomerase) that is also well known to exist it two polymorphic forms (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/28/down-at-the-crystal-surface&quot;&gt;that last post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject for more on polymorphs). What isn’t well known is why it forms these particular two types of crystals and how that happens. In virtually every case of polymorphism, we have little or no clue about such things, and I’m very glad to see clues starting to be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these authors have done is to start the crystallization process in ammonium sulfate solution and then freeze the solutions (liquid nitrogen) at various time points, imaging the crystals thus found by electron microscopy. And there are some surprises. At the twenty-second time point, there are already “nanorod” crystals forming, which are, on the average, &lt;em&gt;two protein molecules wide and twelve molecules long&lt;/em&gt;. You are not going to get too much earlier in the crystal formation process than that. The concentration of the nanorods increases over time. However, their length does not: they seem stuck at this size. They do start to associate into fibrils as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other things happening as well. There are other species in there (trimer, tetramers, single-file chains), and after about thirty minutes you can also see faceted nanocrystals of the two known bulk polymorphs, one prismatic and rodlike and one rhombic. The smallest of each are in the 100 nM range along their shortest edges. Trying the experiment using PEG instead of ammonium sulfate (another known set of conditions for producing these protein crystals) shows that the useful concentration range for the additive is much narrower, but in both cases, at the low end of the range you get rhombic, and at the high end you get prismatic. With PEG, though, if you keep pushing it, you get no crystals at all, but rather an amorphous gel-like state. And in none of the PEG experiments did they ever observe the nanorods seen in ammonium sulfate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-264x300.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Nature, C&amp;amp;E News&quot; width=&quot;264&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-264x300.jpeg 264w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-300x341.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals.jpeg 700w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13431&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gelation pathway seemed to involve fibril formation as well, which looked in the earlier experiments like it might be a precursor to formation of the rhombic crystals. Weirdly, the authors found that you can take some of that gel and use it to nucleate another protein solution, one that would otherwise form only the rhombic crystals, and form the prismatic crystals with it instead (which is a bizarre thought to me, and probably to a lot of other people who don’t crystallize things for a living). You actually see the crystals growing out of the surface of the lump of gelatinous protein gorp, as shown at right. This is order out of chaos, for sure; I’ll bet that the temperature of the solution at that interface is changing just to make the thermodynamics of all that loss of entropy work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the early stages of crystal formation like this allowed the authors to come up with all the plausible models of the nanorods and compare those to experimental data. One clearly matches better than the rest of them, so now we know what the earliest crystal formation contacts are, and can start to explain why. The preferred mode of contact buries a lot more negative charges in the protein surface, and the paper goes into detail about how this can explain the effects of sulfate ions in the solution versus PEG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it appears that the prismatic crystals (from ammonium sulfate) are made up of bunches of nanorods, rather than growing molecule-by-molecule, which is also contrary to the mental pictures that many of us have. Meanwhile, the rhombic crystals grow more like the traditional picture, monomer by monomer. The nanorod form, though, can also be trapped in a metastable fibril state, starting off as individual fibrils and going on to a gel, with too high an activation energy to dissociate and form prismatic crystals. But its surface can nucleate the formation of such crystals (as in the above photo). At really high PEG concentrations you get a different gel, which is not composed of fibrils, and seems to be a complete dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they don’t see any evidence for, though, is another mode predicted by theory (and which I mentioned in the last post on this stuff): formation of phase-separated nanodroplets that then crystallize. Those nanodroplets take us back to the hot topic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;protein condensates&lt;/a&gt; inside cells, and perhaps its a good thing that they’re not invariably precursors to forming protein crystals (!) That is very likely the reason that such condensates seem to feature intrinsically disordered proteins as well, to avoid the crystallization problem. . .&lt;/p&gt;

Such demonstrations not only provide evidence of a unique form of robustness, but also show that reconfigurable microwave circuits are a promising platform for exploring exotic topological phases of matter.</description></item><item><engagement>129</engagement><title>No one is an island</title><engagementRate>2.39</engagementRate><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a529826:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/122.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/122?rss=1</originId><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/122?rss=1</link><fingerprint>f2885bd9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/122?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>O&apos;Loughlin, L.</name></author><published>1522950073000</published></item><item><engagement>4</engagement><title>Listen to the whisper of the rocks, telling their ancient story [Physical Sciences]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2902.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1626893ee0e:63522d7:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2902</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2902.short?rss=1</originId><published>1522168915000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Letters</item></keywords><fingerprint>14493033</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2902.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Rovere et al.

Climate change is expected to affect resource-consumer interactions underlying stability in polar food webs. Polar benthic organisms have adapted to the marked seasonality characterising their habitats by concentrating foraging and reproductive activity in summer months, when inputs from sympagic and pelagic producers increase. While this enables the persistence of biodiverse food webs, the mechanisms underlying changes in resource use and nutrient transfer are poorly understood. Thus, our understanding of how temporal and spatial variations in the supply of resources may affect food web structure and functioning is limited. By means of C and N isotopic analyses of two key Antarctic benthic consumers (&lt;i&gt;Adamussium colbecki&lt;/i&gt;, Bivalvia, and &lt;i&gt;Sterechinus neumayeri&lt;/i&gt;, Echinoidea) and Bayesian mixing models, we describe changes in trophic niche and nutrient transfer across trophic levels associated with the long- and short-term diet and body size of specimens sampled in midsummer in both shallow and deep waters. Samplings occurred soon after the sea-ice broke up at Tethys Bay, an area characterised by extreme seasonality in sea-ice coverage and productivity in the Ross Sea. In the long term, the trophic niche was broader and variation between specimens was greater, with intermediate-size specimens generally consuming a higher number of resources than small and large specimens. The coupling of energy channels in the food web was consequently more direct than in the short term. Sediment and benthic algae were more frequently consumed in the long term, before the sea-ice broke up, while consumers specialised on sympagic algae and plankton in the short term. Regardless of the time scale, sympagic algae were more frequently consumed in shallow waters, while plankton was more frequently consumed in deep waters. Our results suggest a strong temporal relationship between resource availability and the trophic niche of benthic consumers in Antarctica.

Analyzing extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an attractive approach to diagnosis of prostate diagnosis. However, existing methods of EVs isolation have low efficiency, purity, and long process time, and therefore have low diagnostic ability. To solve these the problems, a two-phase system is adapted to isolate EVs from a patient’s urine. Urine from 20 prostate cancer (PCA) patients and 10 benign prostate hyperplasia patients was used to quantify the EVs-isolation ability of an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) and to compare the diagnostic ability of ATPS with that of the conventional diagnosis method. An optimized ATPS isolates EVs with ~100% efficiency within ~30 min, with 14 times as high as achieved by ultracentrifugation. Afterward, PCR and ELISA are used to detect EVs derived from PCA cells in urine. The results demonstrate that diagnostic ability based on ATPS is better than other conventional diagnostic methods. ATPS can obtain a high quality and quantity of EVs from patients’ urine. EVs contain cancer-related protein and genes, so these abundant sources enable diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, ATPS is a useful tool to increase the specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis.</content></content><author><name>Hyunwoo Shin</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunwoo Shin, Yong Hyun Park, Yong-Goo Kim, Ji Youl Lee, Jaesung Park&lt;/p&gt;

Wildlife mortality investigations are important for conservation, food safety, and public health; but they are infrequently reported for cryptic chelonian species. Eastern box turtles (&lt;i&gt;Terrapene carolina carolina&lt;/i&gt;) are declining due to anthropogenic factors and disease, and while mortality investigations have been reported for captive and translocated individuals, few descriptions exist for free-living populations. We report the results of four natural mortality event investigations conducted during routine health surveillance of three Illinois box turtle populations in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In April 2011, over 50 box turtles were found dead and a polymicrobial necrotizing bacterial infection was diagnosed in five survivors using histopathology and aerobic/anaerobic culture. This represents the first reported occurrence of necrotizing bacterial infection in box turtles. In August 2013, paired histopathology and qPCR ranavirus detection in nine turtles was significantly associated with occupation of moist microhabitats, identification of oral plaques and nasal discharge on physical exam, and increases in the heterophil count and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In July 2014 and 2015, ranavirus outbreaks reoccurred within a 0.2km radius of highly-disturbed habitat containing ephemeral ponds used by amphibians for breeding. qPCR ranavirus detection in five individuals each year was significantly associated with use of moist microhabitats (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Detection of single and co-pathogens (Terrapene herpesvirus 1, adenovirus, and &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma&lt;/i&gt; sp.) was common before, during, and after mortality events, but improved sample size would be necessary to determine the impacts of these pathogens on the occurrence and outcome of mortality events. This study provides novel information about the causes and predictors of natural box turtle mortality events. Continued investigation of health, disease, and death in free-living box turtles will improve baseline knowledge of morbidity and mortality, identify threats to survival, and promote the formation of effective conservation strategies.</content></content><author><name>Laura Adamovicz</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Adamovicz, Matthew C.

In April 2011, over 50 box turtles were found dead and a polymicrobial necrotizing bacterial infection was diagnosed in five survivors using histopathology and aerobic/anaerobic culture. This represents the first reported occurrence of necrotizing bacterial infection in box turtles. In August 2013, paired histopathology and qPCR ranavirus detection in nine turtles was significantly associated with occupation of moist microhabitats, identification of oral plaques and nasal discharge on physical exam, and increases in the heterophil count and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In July 2014 and 2015, ranavirus outbreaks reoccurred within a 0.2km radius of highly-disturbed habitat containing ephemeral ponds used by amphibians for breeding. qPCR ranavirus detection in five individuals each year was significantly associated with use of moist microhabitats (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Detection of single and co-pathogens (Terrapene herpesvirus 1, adenovirus, and &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma&lt;/i&gt; sp.) was common before, during, and after mortality events, but improved sample size would be necessary to determine the impacts of these pathogens on the occurrence and outcome of mortality events. This study provides novel information about the causes and predictors of natural box turtle mortality events. Continued investigation of health, disease, and death in free-living box turtles will improve baseline knowledge of morbidity and mortality, identify threats to survival, and promote the formation of effective conservation strategies.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Relaxation rates of gene expression kinetics reveal the feedback signs of autoregulatory gene networks</title><link>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009749?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1621bbf925f:6541151:9aea0a7d</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009749?af=R</originId><published>1519885236000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://www.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6cd6a0e</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 9, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009749?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/9&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 9&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>Chen Jia</name></author><crawled>1520883962463</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 9, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Sortase ligation enables homogeneous GPCR phosphorylation to reveal diversity in {beta}-arrestin coupling [Biochemistry]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3834.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162b12a08af:1e3cc:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3834</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3834.short?rss=1</originId><published>1523386901000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d6c7a065</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3834.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The ability of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to initiate complex cascades of cellular signaling is governed by the sequential coupling of three main transducer proteins, G protein, GPCR kinase (GRK), and β-arrestin.

Background &lt;p&gt;The management of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with rate-lowering or anti-arrhythmic drugs has markedly changed over the last decade, but it is unknown how these changes have affected patients with NVAF with a permanent pacemaker (PPM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Through Danish nationwide registries, patients with NVAF and a PPM were identified from 2001 to 2012. Changes in concomitant pharmacotherapy and comorbidities were tested using the Cochran–Armitage trend test and linear regression. Patients with NVAF were identified to calculate the proportional amount of PPM implants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 12,231 NVAF patients with a PPM were included in the study, 55.6% of which were men. Median age was 78 years (interquartile range 70–84). From 2001 to 2012, the number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased from 850 to 1344, while the number of NVAF patients increased from 67,478 to 127,261. Thus, the proportional amount of NVAF patients with a PPM decreased from 1.3% to 1.1% (p = 0.015). Overall 45.9% had atrial fibrillation (AF) duration less than one year and the proportion declined from 55.5% to 42.4% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Diabetes mellitus increased from 7.2% to 16.8% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Heart failure (HF) decreased from 36.7% to 29.3% (p = 0.010) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) decreased from 32.4% to 26.1% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Beta-blocker use increased from 38.1% to 58.0% (p &amp;lt;0.001), while digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drug use decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2012, the absolute number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased while the proportional amount decreased. The number of NVAF patients receiving a PPM within one year of AF diagnosis decreased. The prevalence of DM increased, while the prevalence of HF and IHD was high but decreasing. The use of beta-blockers increased markedly, while use of digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drugs decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Frederik Dalgaard</name></author><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Frederik Dalgaard, Martin H.

Sinkholes are a well-known geologic hazard but their past occurrence, useful for subsidence risk prediction, is difficult to define, especially for ancient historic times. Consequently, our knowledge about Holocene carbonate landscapes is often limited. A multidisciplinary study of Trieste Karst (Italy), close to early Roman military fortifications, led to the identification of possible ancient road tracks, cut by at least one sinkhole. Electrical Resistivity Tomography through the sinkhole has suggested the presence of a cave below its bottom, possibly responsible of the sinkhole formation, while Ground Penetrating Radar has detected no tectonic disturbances underneath the tracks. Additionally, archaeological surveys led to the discovery of over 200 Roman shoe hobnails within or close to the investigated route. According to these data, the tracks are interpreted as the remains of a main Roman road, whose itinerary has been reconstructed for more than 4 km together with other elements of ancient landscape. Our results provide the first known evidence of a Roman main road swallowed by sinkholes and suggest that Holocene karst landscapes could be much different from what previously believed. In fact, sinkholes visible nowadays in the investigated region could have been flat areas filled by sediments up to the Roman time.</content></content><author><name>Federico Bernardini</name></author><crawled>1521914586877</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Bernardini, Giacomo Vinci, Emanuele Forte, Stefano Furlani, Michele Pipan, Sara Biolchi, Angelo De Min, Andrea Fragiacomo, Roberto Micheli, Paola Ventura, Claudio Tuniz&lt;/p&gt;

Anthocyanins are naturally active substances. In this study, anthocyanins from black rice were obtained by membrane filtration and column chromatography separation. Five anthocyanin monomers in black rice extract were identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and the major anthocyanin monomer (cyanidin-3-glucoside, C3G) was purified by preparative HPLC (Pre-HPLC). The proliferative effects of the anthocyanins on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were investigated by determining the media pH, bacterial populations and metabolic products. After anaerobic incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, not only the pH of the media containing C3G was lower than that of the extract of black rice anthocyanin (BRAE), but the numbers of both Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were also significantly increased. Furthermore, hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, and hydroxybenzoic acids and other metabolites were detected by GC-MS &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our results revealed that the anthocyanins and anthocyanin monomers from black rice had prebiotic activity and they were metabolized into several small molecules by Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.</content></content><author><name>Yongsheng Zhu</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yongsheng Zhu, Hanju Sun, Shudong He, Qiuyan Lou, Min Yu, Mingming Tang, Lijun Tu&lt;/p&gt;

Furthermore, hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, and hydroxybenzoic acids and other metabolites were detected by GC-MS &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our results revealed that the anthocyanins and anthocyanin monomers from black rice had prebiotic activity and they were metabolized into several small molecules by Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23164-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Publisher Correction: Minimally Invasive Micro-Indentation: mapping tissue mechanics at the tip of an 18G needle</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23164-1</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16228bc730c:8d8d77:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23164-1</originId><published>1521097200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d7a6cef9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/BDiTgIWf4NQ/s41598-018-23164-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Minimally Invasive Micro-Indentation: mapping tissue mechanics at the tip of an 18G needle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Minimally Invasive Micro-Indentation: mapping tissue mechanics at the tip of an 18G needle, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23164-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23164-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Minimally Invasive Micro-Indentation: mapping tissue mechanics at the tip of an 18G needle&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/BDiTgIWf4NQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Steven V.

Women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Evidence suggests the microclimate of the classroom is an important factor influencing female course grades and interest, which encourages retention of women in STEM fields. Here, we test whether the gender composition of small (8–9 person) learning groups impacts course performance, sense of social belonging, and intragroup peer evaluations of intellectual contributions. Across two undergraduate active learning courses in introductory biology, we manipulated the classroom microclimate by varying the gender ratios of learning groups, ranging from 0% female to 100% female. We found that as the percent of women in groups increased, so did overall course performance for all students, regardless of gender. Additionally, women assigned higher peer- evaluations in groups with more women than groups with less women. Our work demonstrates an added benefit of the retention of women in STEM: increased performance for all, and positive peer perceptions for women.</content></content><author><name>Lauren L.

Methods: All datapoints from consecutive 24-2 HVFs from 1998 to 2018 were extracted from a University of Washington database.

It also suggests how trimeric L1ORF1p could form larger meshworks and indicates critical novel steps in L1 retrotransposition.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Comparison and combination of “direct” and fragment based local correlation methods: Cluster in molecules and domain based local pair natural orbital perturbation and coupled cluster theories</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021898?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162755fa02e:7650a5d:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021898?af=R</originId><published>1522206653000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3a7959b2</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021898?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yang Guo</name></author><crawled>1522387623982</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01171</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Dynamic Mechanism of a Fluorinated Oxime Reactivator Unbinding from AChE Gorge in Polarizable Water</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01171</link><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_1628b8531ae:2b7334:bdf8aaf1</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01171/20180403/images/medium/jp-2018-011715_0005.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>238</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01171</originId><crawled>1522759184814</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5d851790</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01171/20180403/images/medium/jp-2018-011715_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01171&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

With over 1 million species on earth, each biologically unique, do we have any hope of understanding whether species will persist in a warming world? We might, because it turns out that there is surprising regularity in how warming accelerates the major metabolic processes that power life. A persistent challenge has been to understand ecological effects of temperature in the context of species interactions, especially when individuals not only experience temperature but also mortality due to parasitism or predation. Kirk et al. have shown how the effects of parasites vary with warming in a manner entirely consistent with general temperature dependence of host and parasite metabolism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/u5e7Nju7vII&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Mary I.

&lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agglomerans&lt;/i&gt;) is a Gram-negative bacterium that grows symbiotically with various edible plants, and the oral or sublingual administration of lipopolysaccharide derived from &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; (LPSp) have been suggested to contribute to prevention of immune-related diseases. Our previous study indicated that orally administered LPSp was shown to exhibit an LDL-lowering effect in hyperlipidemic volunteers; however, a preventive effect of LPSp on atherosclerosis is unclear. The present study attempted to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic effect by LPSp in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis. For 16 weeks, apoE-deficient mice were fed an HFD and received drinking water containing LPSp (0.3 or 1 mg/kg body weight/day). The results showed that the orally administered LPSp decreased body weight. A significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque deposition was observed even with the lower dose of LPSp. The biochemical analyses showed that LPSp markedly improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma LDL and oxidized LDL levels. In addition, LPSp significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators including MCP-1 (in the plasma), TNF-α and IL-6 (in the colon), and decreased the oxidative burst activities in the peripheral blood sample. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that oral administration of LPSp can effectively ameliorate HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and inflammatory/oxidative responses to prevent atherosclerosis and related metabolic disorders.</content></content><author><name>Yutaro Kobayashi</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yutaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Inagawa, Chie Kohchi, Kimiko Kazumura, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Miwa, Katsuichiro Okazaki, Gen-Ichiro Soma&lt;/p&gt;

Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that oral administration of LPSp can effectively ameliorate HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and inflammatory/oxidative responses to prevent atherosclerosis and related metabolic disorders.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22950-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Publisher Correction: Inferring structural connectivity using Ising couplings in models of neuronal networks</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22950-1</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1622396e80d:118180:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-22950-1/MediaObjects/41598_2018_22950_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>684</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22950-1</originId><published>1521010800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d412f67f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/cJE1azYrTm4/s41598-018-22950-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Inferring structural connectivity using Ising couplings in models of neuronal networks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Inferring structural connectivity using Ising couplings in models of neuronal networks, Published online: 14 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22950-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22950-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Inferring structural connectivity using Ising couplings in models of neuronal networks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/cJE1azYrTm4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Balasundaram Kadirvelu</name></author><crawled>1521015515149</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Inferring structural connectivity using Ising couplings in models of neuronal networks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Inferring structural connectivity using Ising couplings in models of neuronal networks, Published online: 14 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22950-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22950-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Inferring structural connectivity using Ising couplings in models of neuronal networks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/cJE1azYrTm4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01070</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Chalcone Based Homodimeric PET Agent, 11C-(Chal)2DEA-Me, for Beta Amyloid Imaging: Synthesis and Bioevaluation</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01070</link><id>hkv7tkf6rNovbaIxikRBMOPZEsTuri716fXYbY8OcAk=_162495ff028:36eb7:a077e55f</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01070/20180321/images/medium/mp-2017-01070p_0010.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>208</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01070</originId><crawled>1521649446952</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>cb067204</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01070/20180321/images/medium/mp-2017-01070p_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01070&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an incurable and rare hereditary syndrome. In recent times, treatment with glucocorticoid analogues has been shown to improve the neurological symptoms that characterize this condition, but the molecular mechanism of action of these analogues remains unknown. Hence, the aim of this study was to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of action of glucocorticoid analogues in the treatment of A-T by investigating the role of Dexamethasone (Dexa) in A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines. We used 2DE and tandem MS to identify proteins that were influenced by the drug in A-T cells but not in healthy cells. Thirty-four proteins were defined out of a total of 746±63. Transcriptome analysis was performed by microarray and showed the differential expression of 599 A-T and 362 wild type (WT) genes and a healthy un-matching between protein abundance and the corresponding gene expression variation. The proteomic and transcriptomic profiles allowed the network pathway analysis to pinpoint the biological and molecular functions affected by Dexamethasone in Dexa-treated cells. The present integrated study provides evidence of the molecular mechanism of action of Dexamethasone in an A-T cellular model but also the broader effects of the drug in other tested cell lines.</content></content><author><name>Michele Menotta</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michele Menotta, Sara Orazi, Anna Maria Gioacchini, Chiara Spapperi, Anastasia Ricci, Luciana Chessa, Mauro Magnani&lt;/p&gt;

So far I have yet to come across a drug discovery organization that really thinks that its compound libraries are what they should be – there are too many of those similar compounds from those similar projects that we used to be into back when, there are too many of those compounds that we purchased from vendors X and Y and Z, there are too many insoluble ones or decomposing ones or just plain boring ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s natural to think that the way to better screening results is to have a better compound collection – I mean, what could be more obvious? And it’s also obvious that every compound collection could always improve – it could be larger, or less greasy, or less streaked with legacy compounds that have too much baggage, etc. I don’t think it ever does harm to address these issues. The question is, how much good does it do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask that question just because of the numbers involved. You have the numbers in your own collection, and you have the numbers in chemical space in general. The first is probably pretty large, and the second is larger than any human mind can deal with. Any one company’s compound collection – any one &lt;em&gt;planet’s&lt;/em&gt; compound collection – is a tiny mote in the sky of chemical space, even broadly druglike chemical space. So you’re not going to make much headway on the absolute scale, no matter how many diversity compounds you can get into vials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching to the relative scale, then, you’re still going to have to make a pretty big effort to change your own collection’s character. This is why organizations have, over the years, tended to divide their collections into subfractions. Here are X thousand compounds to represent the deck as a whole – that’s something to use to try an assay out to troubleshoot it and get an idea of what the hit rate will be if you go on. Here’s the fraction of the deck that meets these particular biophysical criteria (and over here is the fraction of the deck that doesn’t). Here’s the fragment collection, here’s the more natural-product-like end of things, here’s the deliberately more three-dimensional set, and so on. In some (many?) companies, a classic screen-the-whole-deck situation has gotten more rare over the years, although there are always targets that need that and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up another consideration: sometimes you want more compounds because you’re not really getting any actionable hits in a screen (particularly against those tough targets). And sometimes you want more compounds because while you’re getting real hits, they’re not hits that you like. Maybe they’re from those legacy projects and the IP/selectivity considerations are too much of a hairball, or they’re coming out too nonpolar or with too few vectors for further optimization, what have you. You’d rather start somewhere else, and the deck doesn’t give you as many somewhere-elses as you’d want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the second category has a better chance of being fixed by adding swaths of new compounds – at least you know that the target is capable of binding small molecules. Now, it can always be the problem that the target just wants ugly chemical matter (CETP is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2012/06/29/the_cetp_rogues_gallery&quot;&gt;classic example&lt;/a&gt;), in which case there may not be much to do about it, but there will surely be other projects where something more workable presents itself. But the first category – just not getting hits – is a tougher situation. You can get stuck in an unprovable-hypothesis loop: if you didn’t get hits, you need more compounds. So you add more, and you didn’t get hits – well, you didn’t add enough, or the right ones. Who’s to say that the winner isn’t just over the horizon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a question that combichem was supposed to help answer back about twenty years ago or so, and it’s the question that its sequel, DNA-encoded library screening, is supposed to help answer now. From the beginning, the tricky part of the latter compounds sets has been the number of reactions compatible with the attached DNA barcodes. Combichem had that problem, too, in its early days: what price another ten thousand aryl amides? But (partly because of that grim experience) the DEL folks have been, right from the start, trying to expand their synthetic universe, and these efforts continue. My read so far on DEL screening is that it’s a very useful technique, but (as is always the case) not a magic bullet. People outside of drug discovery always seem to be amazed that we can screen a million compounds and not find something that binds to Target X, and they’d be even more amazed to know that you can run a whole series of DELs, containing (well, most likely) as many compounds as there are people on earth, and still not get a hit, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are also questions that DOS, diversity-oriented synthesis, was designed to help answer. I’ve always had &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/11/11/and_one_was_just_right&quot;&gt;reservations about that concept&lt;/a&gt;, but there have been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio.2420&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30249-0&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; papers that have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066158/&quot;&gt;continued&lt;/a&gt; to come out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392761/&quot;&gt;screening&lt;/a&gt; such collections. You can also see that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5171204/&quot;&gt;synthetic&lt;/a&gt; work &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.7b01776&quot;&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b06994&quot;&gt;reactions&lt;/a&gt; to make more diverse compounds sets feasible. Those papers, and more like them, are uncovered through a PubMed search on “Schreiber SL”, although there are others. One problem, though, is that a search for “diversity oriented synthesis” itself turns up both these papers and a mound of other stuff besides. There are an awful lot of papers that appropriate the term to mean “We made a bunch of stuff because we could and here it is”. The uncharitable view is that’s what the early DOS papers from the Broad added up to as well, but believe me, this other stuff is really the pits. When you see someone banging out a bunch of (say) chalcones and slapping a “diversity-oriented synthesis” label on the resulting work, well, it really makes you roll your eyes. Schreiber must love it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But has the DOS concept caught on outside the Broad Institute? It’s pretty labor-intensive, from a synthetic chemistry standpoint, although it’s designed to minimize that as much as possible once its time to actually make the libraries. But that’s a real “measure twice, cut once” situation; the last thing you want to do is rip into a big library synthesis that generates a bunch of half-made and truncated stuff instead of your desired Land of Diversity. I would like to have a better feel for how this is all working out. It may be that only organizations with significant manpower and funding can make a go of it, and significant bravery/nerve may be a requirement as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now DOS is, in the grand scheme of things, a series of shots into that gigantic chemical space mentioned above, and you could spend a lifetime at it and never make a dent in the number of untested areas – but (as above) is that the relevant question? The current version of it appears to be providing some interesting hits against interesting targets, and what more can you ask? It would be very worthwhile to study the hit rates (and hit quality) of DOS screening as practiced at the Broad versus what comes out of more conventional large compound collections, but if a large-scale comparison of this sort is publicly available, I’ve missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thoughts? How much effort is appropriate to beef up the screening collection, and what kind of return can one expect? Are you better letting the vendors clean out their closets and sell the stuff to you, or trying to make compounds yourself/pay someone to make them? What’s the comparative return on those?

A key focus of the racing industry is to reduce the number of race-day events where horses die suddenly or are euthanased due to catastrophic injury. The objective of this study was therefore to determine risk factors for race-day fatalities in Thoroughbred racehorses, using a cohort of all horses participating in flat racing in Great Britain between 2000 and 2013. Horse-, race- and course-level data were collected and combined with all race-day fatalities, recorded by racecourse veterinarians in a central database. Associations between exposure variables and fatality were assessed using logistic regression analyses for (1) all starts in the dataset and (2) starts made on turf surfaces only. There were 806,764 starts in total, of which 548,571 were on turf surfaces. A total of 610 fatalities were recorded; 377 (61.8%) on turf. In both regression models, increased firmness of the going, increasing racing distance, increasing average horse performance, first year of racing and wearing eye cover for the first time all increased the odds of fatality. Generally, the odds of fatality also increased with increasing horse age whereas increasing number of previous starts reduced fatality odds. In the ‘all starts’ model, horses racing in an auction race were at 1.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–2.01) times the odds of fatality compared with horses not racing in this race type. In the turf starts model, horses racing in Group 1 races were at 3.19 (95% CI 1.71–5.93) times the odds of fatality compared with horses not racing in this race type. Identification of novel risk factors including wearing eye cover and race type will help to inform strategies to further reduce the rate of fatality in flat racing horses, enhancing horse and jockey welfare and safety.</content></content><author><name>Sarah M.

This can be challenging due to the heterogeneity and size of the data as well as the fact that multiple attributes need to be considered in combination. Advanced visual exploration tools, going beyond static spreadsheet tools, are needed to aid this prioritization process.

Antennal sensory units in nymphs and adults of the spotted Lanternfly, &lt;i&gt;Lycorma delicatula&lt;/i&gt; (White) (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha: Fulgoridae), an economically important plant pest, are studied with scanning electron microscopy. Sensilla trichodea / chaetica type recognition is based on their external morphology and ratio of their size to diameter. The flagellum Bourgoin’s organ is a complex sensory unit with 2–3 internal sensilla coeloconica. During nymphal stages, the sensory surface available for a chemoreceptive function particularly increases with the number and size of sensilla placodea on the antennal pedicel. From first to fourth instar and to adult males and females, plate organ sensory surface is estimated to increase respectively by 33x, 68x and 125x (= 2.72 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.02 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively for males and females). The most important increase (5x) occurs between second and third instar. In parallel, a distinctive pair of plate organs on the flagellum decreases in size from first to third instar, and disappears.

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new more thermostable Flolan (epoprostenol) solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent in Japanese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) receiving higher doses of Flolan than those typically administered in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This open-label, single-arm study was conducted in 10 Japanese PAH patients. During the run-in period, patients were intravenously infused with Flolan (45 ng/kg/min or higher doses) solution prepared with the existing pH 10.5 diluent. The patients were then switched to a new more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent and observed for a 4-week treatment period. As a primary endpoint, safety after switching to the new Flolan solution was evaluated. Secondary endpoints included hemodynamics and the necessity for dose adjustment of Flolan in these patients.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All 10 patients completed the study period. Observed adverse events were nausea and hepatic function abnormal in 1 patient each, and both events were mild. No patients required dose adjustment due to the change from baseline in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) measured 3 hrs after switching to Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated diluent. No major changes from baseline in mPAP, pulmonary vascular resistance, or right atrial pressure were observed at 24 hrs and at 4 weeks after switching to the Flolan solution prepared with pH 12.0 diluent. Although some patients showed increases in cardiac output (CO) from baseline at 24 hrs and 4 weeks, no patients required dose reduction as a result of an increase in CO.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Neither safety/efficacy concerns nor any dose adjustments of Flolan after switching to a more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent could be required in Japanese patients with PAH receiving higher doses of Flolan.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02705807&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Kazuko Mihara</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kazuko Mihara, Aiko Ogawa, Hiromi Matsubara, Takumi Terao, Yoshitaka Ichikawa&lt;/p&gt;

With the exploitation of offshore oil and gas gradually moving to deep water, higher temperature differences and pressure differences are applied to the pipeline system, making the global buckling of the pipeline more serious. For unburied deep-water pipelines, the lateral buckling is the major buckling form. The initial imperfections widely exist in the pipeline system due to manufacture defects or the influence of uneven seabed, and the distribution and geometry features of initial imperfections are random. They can be divided into two kinds based on shape: single-arch imperfections and double-arch imperfections. This paper analyzed the global buckling process of a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections by using a numerical simulation method and revealed how the ratio of the initial imperfection’s space length to the imperfection’s wavelength and the combination of imperfections affects the buckling process. The results show that a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections may suffer the superposition of global buckling. The growth ratios of buckling displacement, axial force and bending moment in the superposition zone are several times larger than no buckling superposition pipeline. The ratio of the initial imperfection’s space length to the imperfection’s wavelength decides whether a pipeline suffers buckling superposition. The potential failure point of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is as same as the no buckling superposition pipeline, but the failure risk of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is much higher.

The failure risk of pipeline with two double-arch imperfections is higher than pipeline with two single-arch imperfections.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00021</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Divide–Expand–Consolidate Second-Order Møller–Plesset Theory with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00021</link><id>nWAmhAfvfdY6zhQafSMhdWASYooG1IX3uplCe3rnLYA=_1629173641f:aded1:a077e55f</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00021/20180404/images/medium/ct-2018-00021t_0004.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>238</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00021</originId><crawled>1522858681375</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId></origin><fingerprint>af54785d</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00021/20180404/images/medium/ct-2018-00021t_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00021&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

However, short-term high DO exposure can select for AOB and against NOB in full-scale domestic WWTPs and such population dynamics depend on which specific AOB and NOB species predominate under given environmental conditions.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00057</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Biochemical and Structural Studies of the Interaction between ARAP1 and CIN85</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00057</link><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_1626d72a256:3b4264:bdf8aaf1</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00057/20180327/images/medium/bi-2018-00057t_0006.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>203</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00057</originId><crawled>1522254651990</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><fingerprint>92f41c35</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00057/20180327/images/medium/bi-2018-00057t_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00057&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Offspring survival is generally more variable than adult survival and may limit population growth. Although white-tailed deer neonate survival has been intensively investigated, recent work has emphasized how specific cover types influence neonate survival at local scales (single study area). These localized investigations have often led to inconsistences within the literature. Developing specific hypotheses describing the relationships among environmental, habitat, and landscape factors influencing white-tailed deer neonate survival at regional scales may allow for detection of generalized patterns. Therefore, we developed 11 hypotheses representing the various effects of environmental (e.g., winter and spring weather), habitat (e.g., hiding and escape cover types), and landscape factors (e.g., landscape configuration regardless of specific cover type available) on white-tailed deer neonate survival up to one-month and from one- to three-months of age. At one-month, surviving fawns experienced a warmer lowest recorded June temperature and more June precipitation than those that perished. At three-months, patch connectance (percent of patches of the corresponding patch type that are connected within a predefined distance) positively influenced survival. Our results are consistent with white-tailed deer neonate ecology: increased spring temperature and precipitation are likely associated with a flush of nutritional resources available to the mother, promoting increased lactation efficiency and neonate growth early in life. In contrast, reduced spring temperature with increased precipitation place neonates at risk to hypothermia. Increased patch connectance likely reflects increased escape cover available within a neonate’s home range after they are able to flee from predators. If suitable escape cover is available on the landscape, then managers could focus efforts towards manipulating landscape configuration (patch connectance) to promote increased neonate survival while monitoring spring weather to assess potential influences on current year survival.</content></content><author><name>Eric S.

To grow straight and upright, plants need to regulate actively their posture. Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation (tilting) experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observations of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. The relationship between those oscillations and the postural control of the organ remains unclear, but indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.</content></content><author><name>Renaud Bastien</name></author><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Renaud Bastien, Olivia Guayasamin, Stéphane Douady, Bruno Moulia&lt;/p&gt;

Exposure to intense predation risk can induce morphological and behavioural phenotypes that prepare prey, often at young ages, for surviving attacks from unknown predators. However, previous studies revealed that this survival advantage depended on the predator species. Here, we used alarm cues from injured conspecifics to simulate a period of high predation risk for embryonic wood frogs, &lt;i&gt;Lithobates sylvaticus&lt;/i&gt;. Two weeks post-hatching, we tested whether the embryonic risk exposure influenced survival in encounters with two novel predators: (1) a spider (&lt;i&gt;Dolomedes&lt;/i&gt; sp.) that ambushes prey exclusively on the surface of the water, and (2) the adult predacious diving beetle (&lt;i&gt;Dytiscus&lt;/i&gt; sp.) which displays underwater sit-and-wait posture and pursuit tactics. Tadpoles exposed to embryonic high-risk survived longer when encountering spiders, whereas background risk had no influence on survival with adult beetles. These findings, coupled with survival studies involving other predator types, indicate that a high-risk environment promotes tadpole survival in future encounters with unknown sit-and-wait predators, but at the cost of increased vulnerability to novel predators capable of active pursuit.</content></content><author><name>Adam L.

Commercially available HCV genotyping kits are scarce and this analysis is often in-house using tedious PCRs and Sanger sequencing, leading to a lack of standardization. A newly commercialized HCV genotyping assay based on real-time PCR has been developed by Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). We compared this new assay with our in-house PCRs -sequencing technique on 101 regular samples and 81 LiPA failures or low viral load samples. No genotype or 1a/1b subtype mismatch was observed. Two samples were misidentified at the subtype level without clinical impact. Three genotype 1b and two genotype 1a samples with low viral load could not be subtyped. Nevertheless, 13 (13%) samples from the regular panel and 35 (43%) from the more difficult-to-type panels failed to give results on first pass with the Roche kit. Failures were mostly associated with genotype 3 subtype a, with genotype 4 subtype non-a, or with viral loads &amp;lt;200 IU/mL (p = 0.0061).

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sensitive inflammatory marker rapidly increased in response to infection, injury or trauma during the acute phase. Resolution of the acute phase and SAA reduction are well documented, however the exact mechanism remains elusive. Two inducible SAA proteins, SAA1 and SAA2, with their variants could contribute to systemic inflammation. While unconjugated human variant SAA1α is already commercially available, the variants of SAA2 are not. Antibodies against SAA have been identified in apparently healthy blood donors (HBDs) in smaller, preliminary studies. So, our objective was to detect anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in the sera of 300 HBDs using ELISA, characterize their specificity and avidity. Additionally, we aimed to determine the presence of anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations and examine their effects on released IL-6 from SAA/SAA1α-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Autoantibodies against SAA and SAA1α had a median (IQR) absorbance OD (A&lt;sub&gt;450&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.655 (0.262–1.293) and 0.493 (0.284–0.713), respectively. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α exhibited heterogeneous to high avidity and reached peak levels between 41–50 years, then diminished with age in the oldest group (51–67 years). Women consistently exhibited significantly higher levels than men. Good positive correlation was observed between anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α were detected in IVIg, their fractions subsequently isolated, and shown to decrease IL-6 protein levels released from SAA/SAA1α-treated PBMCs. In conclusion, naturally occurring antibodies against SAA and anti-SAA1α could play a physiological role in down-regulating their antigen and proinflammatory cytokines leading to the resolution of the acute phase and could be an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.</content></content><author><name>Tadeja Kuret</name></author><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tadeja Kuret, Katja Lakota, Polonca Mali, Saša Čučnik, Sonja Praprotnik, Matija Tomšič, Snezna Sodin-Semrl&lt;/p&gt;
Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sensitive inflammatory marker rapidly increased in response to infection, injury or trauma during the acute phase. Resolution of the acute phase and SAA reduction are well documented, however the exact mechanism remains elusive. Two inducible SAA proteins, SAA1 and SAA2, with their variants could contribute to systemic inflammation. While unconjugated human variant SAA1α is already commercially available, the variants of SAA2 are not. Antibodies against SAA have been identified in apparently healthy blood donors (HBDs) in smaller, preliminary studies. So, our objective was to detect anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in the sera of 300 HBDs using ELISA, characterize their specificity and avidity. Additionally, we aimed to determine the presence of anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations and examine their effects on released IL-6 from SAA/SAA1α-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Autoantibodies against SAA and SAA1α had a median (IQR) absorbance OD (A&lt;sub&gt;450&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.655 (0.262–1.293) and 0.493 (0.284–0.713), respectively. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α exhibited heterogeneous to high avidity and reached peak levels between 41–50 years, then diminished with age in the oldest group (51–67 years). Women consistently exhibited significantly higher levels than men. Good positive correlation was observed between anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α were detected in IVIg, their fractions subsequently isolated, and shown to decrease IL-6 protein levels released from SAA/SAA1α-treated PBMCs. In conclusion, naturally occurring antibodies against SAA and anti-SAA1α could play a physiological role in down-regulating their antigen and proinflammatory cytokines leading to the resolution of the acute phase and could be an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.</description></item><item><engagement>63</engagement><title>Learning by neural reassociation</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0095-3</link><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_1621b75ed54:64c6b38:9aea0a7d</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41593-018-0095-3/MediaObjects/41593_2018_95_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>188</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0095-3</originId><published>1520838000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Neuroscience</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7b98e68f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0095-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning by neural reassociation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning by neural reassociation, Published online: 12 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0095-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0095-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Learning is ubiquitous in everyday life, yet it is unclear how neurons change their activity together during learning.

Hyperopia is a common refractive error, apparent in 25% of Europeans. Treatments include spectacles, contact lenses, laser interventions and surgery including implantable contact lenses and lens extraction. Laser treatment offers an expedient and reliable means of correcting ametropia. LASIK is well-established however SMILE (small-incision lenticule extraction) or lenticule implantation (derived from myopic laser-correction) are newer options. In this study we compared the outcomes of hyperopic LASIK, SMILE and lenticule re-implantation in a primate model at +2D/+4D treatment. While re-implantation showed the greatest regression, broadly comparable refractive results were seen at 3-months with SMILE and LASIK (&amp;lt;1.4D of intended), but a greater tendency to regression in +2D lenticule reimplantation. Central corneal thickness showed greater variation at +2D treatment, but central thickening during lenticule reimplantation at +4D treatment was seen (-17± 27μm LASIK, -45 ± 18μm SMILE and 28 ± 17μm Re-implantation; p &amp;lt;0.01) with expected paracentral thinning following SMILE. Although in vivo confocal microscopy appeared to show higher reflectivity in all +4D treatment groups, there were minimal and inconsistent changes in inflammatory responses between modalities. SMILE and lenticule re-implantation may represent a safe and viable method for treating hyperopia, but further optimization for lower hyperopic treatments is warranted.</content></content><author><name>Geraint P.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To adapt and refine a previously-developed youth-specific algorithm to identify bedrest for use in adults. The algorithm is based on using an automated decision tree (DT) analysis of accelerometry data.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Healthy adults (n = 141, 85 females, 19–69 years-old) wore accelerometers on the waist, with a subset also wearing accelerometers on the dominant wrist (n = 45). Participants spent ≈24-h in a whole-room indirect calorimeter equipped with a force-platform floor to detect movement.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Minute-by-minute data from recordings of waist-worn or wrist-worn accelerometers were used to identify &lt;i&gt;bedrest&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;wake&lt;/i&gt; periods. Participants were randomly allocated to development (n = 69 and 23) and validation (n = 72 and 22) groups for waist-worn and wrist-worn accelerometers, respectively. The optimized DT algorithm parameters were &lt;i&gt;block length&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;threshold&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bedrest-start trigger&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;bedrest-end trigger&lt;/i&gt;. Differences between DT classification and synchronized objective classification by the room calorimeter to &lt;i&gt;bedrest&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;wake&lt;/i&gt; were assessed for sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) procedure applied to 1-min epochs (n = 92,543 waist; n = 30,653 wrist).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The optimal algorithm parameter values for &lt;i&gt;block length&lt;/i&gt; were 60 and 45 min, &lt;i&gt;thresholds&lt;/i&gt; 12.5 and 400 counts/min, &lt;i&gt;bedrest-start trigger&lt;/i&gt; 120 and 400 counts/min, and &lt;i&gt;bedrest-end trigger&lt;/i&gt; 1,200 and 1,500 counts/min, for the waist and wrist-worn accelerometers, respectively. &lt;i&gt;Bedrest&lt;/i&gt; was identified correctly in the validation group with sensitivities of 0.819 and 0.912, specificities of 0.966 and 0.923, and accuracies of 0.755 and 0.859 by the waist and wrist-worn accelerometer, respectively.

The automated bedrest/sleep detection DT algorithm for both youth and adults is openly accessible as a package “PhysActBedRest” for the R-computer language.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>139</engagement><title>Neural mediators of changes of mind about perceptual decisions</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0104-6</link><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_1621b3a65c8:645fa5e:923c4a60</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41593-018-0104-6/MediaObjects/41593_2018_104_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>472</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0104-6</originId><published>1520838000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Neuroscience</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><fingerprint>296595d3</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0104-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neural mediators of changes of mind about perceptual decisions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neural mediators of changes of mind about perceptual decisions, Published online: 12 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0104-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0104-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Changing one’s mind requires revising previous decisions in light of new evidence.

There is a marked comorbidity between alcohol abuse and eating disorders, especially in the young population. We have previously reported that bingeing on fat during adolescence increases the rewarding effects of ethanol (EtOH). The aim of the present work was to study if vulnerability to EtOH persists after cessation of binge eating. OF1 mice binged on fat (HFB: high-fat binge) during adolescence (PND 25–43) and were tested for 15 days after the last access to HFB (on PND 59) using the self-administration paradigm, the conditioned place preference (CPP) and locomotor sensitization to ethanol. Our results showed that after 15 days of cessation of fat ingestion, mice increased their consumption of ethanol and showed greater motivation to obtain ethanol. On the other hand, no effects were observed in the CPP, while an increased locomotor response to ethanol was detected. The present results confirm and extend our previous study demonstrating that the compulsive intake of fat induces long-lasting effects on the reward system that lead to an increased consumption of EtOH.</content></content><author><name>M.

Background/Objectives &lt;p&gt;Abdominal obesity (AO) is associated with elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases; however, this association is less clear for non-obese people. We estimated the association of AO and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and disease in non-obese adult individuals from Chile.&lt;/p&gt; Subjects/Methods &lt;p&gt;5248 adults (15 years of age or older) of both sexes from the Chilean National Health Survey (October 2009 –September 2010, response rate 85%.) were included. Information on myocardial infarction and stroke was self-reported. BMI, waist circumference (WC), arterial pressure, plasma glucose, and cholesterol levels were measured. Predictive accuracy of WC was evaluated by area under curve of receiver operating characteristic analysis and cut off points were established by Youden Index. Relationship between AO and CVRF was analyzed by Chi-squared tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Normal weight/overweight/obesity were present in 34.4%/45.2%/18.1% of men and 33.4%/33.6%/27.5% of women. Predictive accuracy of WC to identify at least one CVRF was 0.70/0.67 and optimal cutoff points for WC in non-obese subjects were 91/83 cm in men/women, respectively. AO was present in 98.2%/99.1% of obese, 70.5%/77.4% of overweight and 12.4%/16.4% of normal weight men/women. AO was associated with increased frequency of CVRF in overweight men (6/8 and stroke) and women (4/8) and higher frequency in normal weight men (8/8 and myocardial infarction/stroke) and women (6/8 and myocardial infarction).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;WC cutoff points calculated for non-obese chilean population discriminate more differences in CVRF in normal weight woman. AO significantly increases the frequency of CVRF and diseases in overweight and especially normal weight individuals. WC can be used as a low cost, feasible and reproducible predictor for CVRF in non-obese individuals in most clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Beatriz Villanueva</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beatriz Villanueva, Antonio Arteaga, Alberto Maiz, Víctor A.

WC can be used as a low cost, feasible and reproducible predictor for CVRF in non-obese individuals in most clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Integrating co-expression networks with GWAS to prioritize causal genes in maize [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221655v2?rss=1</link><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1623fecce63:29974d1:9f3b30f2</id><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/19/221655</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221655v2?rss=1</originId><published>1521442800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4d6bba49</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221655v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of loci linked to hundreds of traits in many different species.

Our objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness of shorter versus longer duration antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections in adults and children in secondary care settings, using the evidence from published systematic reviews. We conducted electronic searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Cinahl. Our primary outcome was clinical resolution. The quality of included reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR criteria, and the quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE criteria. We included 6 systematic reviews (n = 3,162). Four reviews were rated high quality, and two of moderate quality. In adults, there was no difference between shorter versus longer duration in clinical resolution rates for peritonitis (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 24%), or acute pyelonephritis and septic UTI (clinical failure: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.18). The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate. In children, there was no difference in clinical resolution rates for pneumonia (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 48%), pyelonephritis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04) and confirmed bacterial meningitis (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.11, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. In conclusion, there is currently a limited body of evidence to clearly assess the clinical benefits of shorter versus longer duration antibiotics in secondary care. High quality trials assessing strategies to shorten antibiotic treatment duration for bacterial infections in secondary care settings should now be a priority.</content></content><author><name>Igho J.

High quality trials assessing strategies to shorten antibiotic treatment duration for bacterial infections in secondary care settings should now be a priority.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00741</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Modeling pK Shift in DNA Triplexes Containing Locked Nucleic Acids</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00741</link><id>bE0mPve90xtDW7Mgx9+xm/gIKXt54qktoOvefuUy0ZI=_162547f9c42:48b3a3:bdf8aaf1</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.7b00741/20180323/images/medium/ci-2017-00741z_0010.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>285</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00741</originId><crawled>1521836072002</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jcisd8</streamId></origin><fingerprint>78db626</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.7b00741/20180323/images/medium/ci-2017-00741z_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00741&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Thorough understanding of biodiversity is a fundamental prerequisite for biological research. A lack of taxonomic knowledge and species misidentifications are particularly critical for conservation. Here we present an example of &lt;i&gt;Potamogeton floridanus&lt;/i&gt;, the Florida Pondweed, an endangered taxon endemic to a small area in the Florida panhandle, whose taxonomic status remained controversial for more than a century, and all previous attempts to elucidate its identity have failed. We applied molecular approaches to tackle the origin of the mysterious taxon and supplemented them with morphological and anatomical investigations of both historical herbarium collections and plants recently collected in the type area for a comprehensive taxonomic reassessment. Sequencing of two nuclear ribosomal markers and one chloroplast non-coding spacer resulted in the surprising discovery that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;floridanus&lt;/i&gt; is a hybrid of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pulcher&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;, with the former being the maternal parent. The hybrid colony is currently geographically isolated from the distribution range of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;. We show that previous molecular analyses have failed to reveal its hybrid identity due to inadequate nuclear DNA sequence editing. This is an example how the uncritical use of automized sequence reads can hamper molecular species identifications and also affect phylogenetic tree construction and interpretation. This unique hybrid taxon, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;×floridanus&lt;/i&gt;, adds another case study to the debate on hybrid protection; consequences for its conservation are discussed.</content></content><author><name>Zdeněk Kaplan</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zdeněk Kaplan, Judith Fehrer, Veronika Bambasová, C.

Recent studies have demonstrated how the competition for the finite pool of available gene expression factors has important effect on fundamental gene expression aspects. In this study, based on a whole-cell model simulation of translation in &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, we evaluate for the first time the expected effect of mRNA levels fluctuations on translation due to the finite pool of ribosomes. We show that fluctuations of a single gene or a group of genes mRNA levels induce periodic behavior in all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; translation factors and aspects: the ribosomal densities and the translation rates of all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs oscillate. We numerically measure the oscillation amplitudes demonstrating that fluctuations of endogenous and heterologous genes can cause a significant fluctuation of up to 50% in the steady-state translation rates of the rest of the genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate by synonymous mutations that oscillating the levels of mRNAs that experience high ribosomal occupancy (e.g. ribosomal “traffic jam”) induces the largest impact on the translation of the &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; genome.
The results reported here should provide novel insights and principles related to the design of synthetic gene expression circuits and related to the evolutionary constraints shaping gene expression of endogenous genes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EeyF-2L0x-k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yoram Zarai</name></author><crawled>1522777258471</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoram Zarai, Tamir Tuller&lt;/p&gt;

The reliability of electrical measurements was better for the 90° knee angle compared to the 0° and 30° angles.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Changes in the knee angle may influence the reliability of neuromuscular assessments, which indicates the importance of considering the knee angle to collect consistent outcomes on the PF muscles.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Standards for design and measurement would make clinical research reproducible and usable [Colloquium Paper]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2590.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1622099e6cb:6612ee:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/11/2590/F1.medium.gif</url><width>440</width><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>330</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2590</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2590.short?rss=1</originId><published>1520961997000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Sackler Colloquium on Improving the Reproducibility of Scientific Research</item></keywords><fingerprint>8d0a7815</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2590.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>We find standards useful in everyday life and in science, although we do not always follow them.

Background &lt;p&gt;The treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease remains controversial. Recently, the PLEASE study did not demonstrate any additional clinical benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic treatment. However, the economic impact of the antibiotic strategies has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective economic evaluation, adhering a societal perspective, was performed alongside the PLEASE study, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 1:1:1 randomized clinical trial in which all patients received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks before the 12-week randomized blinded oral antibiotic regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Between 2010 and 2013, patients (n = 271) with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms were enrolled and followed for one year. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental net monetary benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean quality-adjusted life years (95% CI) were not significantly different (p = 0.96): 0.82 (0.77–0.88) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline (n = 82), 0.81 (0.76–0.88) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine (n = 93), and 0.81 (0.76–0.86) for ceftriaxone/placebo (n = 96). Total societal costs per patient (95% CI) were not significantly different either (p = 0.35): €11,995 (€8,823-€15,670) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline, €12,202 (€9,572-€15,253) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, and €15,249 (€11,294-€19,781) for ceftriaxone/placebo. Incremental net monetary benefit (95% CI) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline compared to ceftriaxone/placebo varied from €3,317 (-€2,199-€8,998) to €4,285 (-€6,085-€14,524) over the willingness-to-pay range, and that of ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine compared to ceftriaxone/placebo from €3,098 (-€888-€7,172) to €3,710 (-€4,254-€11,651). For every willingness-to-pay threshold, the incremental net monetary benefits did not significantly differ from zero.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The longer-term treatments were similar with regard to costs, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared to shorter-term treatment in patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms after one year of follow-up.

Background &lt;p&gt;Statins have been known to increase the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM); however, other factors, especially hypertension, are also associated with DM development.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We investigated whether statin use increases the risk of DM and further analyzed whether the relation between statin use and incident DM differs according to the presence of hypertension and gender.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From a nationwide health-screening cohort, 40,164 participants with total cholesterol levels ≥eve mg/dL and without pre-diagnosed DM, cardiovascular disease, or cancer, who underwent a series of regular health check-ups, were enrolled. Statin users were defined as participants who were prescribed statins more than twice during 6 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 17,798 statin non-users and 22,366 statin users. During 7.66±3.21 years of follow-up, incident DM developed in 5.68% of statin non-users and 7.64% of statin users. Among the entire study population, statin use was associated with new-onset DM after adjusting for clinical risk factors. In sub-analysis according to hypertension, statin use significantly increased the risk of incident DM only in normotensive patients [hazard ratio (HR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.58, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004], and not in hypertensive patients (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.05). Furthermore, continuous statin use was strongly associated with new-onset DM in women, regardless of hypertension presence (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05).

We performed de-novo sequencing of the HLA-peptide spectra and discarded all de-novo sequences found in the UniProt database. We checked whether the remaining de-novo sequences could match spliced peptides from human proteins. The spliced sequences were appended to the UniProt fasta file, which was searched by two search tools at a FDR of 1%. We find that maximally 2-4% of the HLA ligandome could be explained as spliced protein fragments. The majority of these potential PSPs have good peptide-spectrum match properties and are predicted to bind the respective HLA molecules. However, it remains to be shown how many of these potential PSPs actually originate from proteasomal splicing events.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Length of hospitalization and mortality for bleeding during treatment with warfarin, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193912</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2805:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1522270800000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193912</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193912</originId><published>1522270800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ae10a1fa</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193912</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Blake Charlton, Gboyega Adeboyeje, John J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Different outcomes among patients hospitalized for bleeding after starting anticoagulation could influence choice of anticoagulant. We compared length of hospitalization, proportion of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length of stay, and 30- and 90-day mortality for adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An US commercial database of 38 million members from 1 November 2010 to 31 March 2014 was used to examine adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin (2,446), dabigatran (442), or rivaroxaban (256). Outcomes included difference in mean total length of hospitalization, proportion of ICU admissions, mean length of ICU stay, and all-cause 30- and 90-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Warfarin users were older and had more comorbidities. Multivariable regression modeling with propensity score weighting showed warfarin users were hospitalized 2.0 days longer (95% CI 1.8–2.3; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than dabigatran users and 2.6 days longer (95% CI 2.4–2.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. Dabigatran users were hospitalized 0.6 days longer (95% CI 0.2–1.0; p = 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in the proportion of ICU admissions. Among ICU admissions, warfarin users stayed 3.0 days (95% CI 1.9–3.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) longer than dabigatran users and 2.4 days longer (95% CI 0.9–3.7; p = 0.003) than rivaroxaban users.

There were no differences in 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rivaroxaban and dabigatran were associated with shorter hospitalizations; however, there were no differences in 30- and 90-day mortality.

How do we rapidly process incoming streams of information in working memory, a cognitive mechanism central to human behavior? Dominant views of working memory focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but human hippocampal recordings provide a neurophysiological signature distinct from the PFC. Are these regions independent, or do they interact in the service of working memory? We addressed this core issue in behavior by recording directly from frontotemporal sites in humans performing a visuospatial working memory task that operationalizes the types of identity and spatiotemporal information we encounter every day. Theta band oscillations drove bidirectional interactions between the PFC and medial temporal lobe (MTL; including the hippocampus). MTL theta oscillations directed the PFC preferentially during the processing of spatiotemporal information, while PFC theta oscillations directed the MTL for all types of information being processed in working memory. These findings reveal an MTL theta mechanism for processing space and time and a domain-general PFC theta mechanism, providing evidence that rapid, dynamic MTL–PFC interactions underlie working memory for everyday experiences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5Z-HrtFgn-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Elizabeth L.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, HSPGs, modulate major transformations of cancer cells, leading to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. HSPGs also regulate neo-angiogenesis which prompts cancer progression and metastatic spread. A different aspect of heparin and analogs is their prominent role in the coagulation of blood. The interplay between coagulation and metastasis is being actively studied: anticoagulants such as heparin-derivatives have anticancer activity and procoagulants, such as thrombin, positively modulate proliferation, migration and invasion. The branched peptide NT4 binds to HSPGs and targets selectively cancer cells and tissues. For this, it had been extensively investigated in the last years and it proved to be efficient as chemotherapeutic and tumor tracer in &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; models of cancer.

In addition, NT4 had important effects on aggressive tumor cells migration and invasion and it also had an anticoagulant profile.The peptide showed very interesting evidence of interference with tumor invasion pathways, offering a cue for its development as a tumor-targeting drug, and also for its use in the study of links between coagulation and tumor progression involving HSPGs.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03540-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>5</engagement><title>Nitrogen-rich organic soils under warm well-drained conditions are global nitrous oxide emission hotspots</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03540-1</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16240323431:2a0affa:9f3b30f2</id><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03540-1</originId><published>1521442800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>86b9bd20</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/gSaO5j38ihs/s41467-018-03540-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nitrogen-rich organic soils under warm well-drained conditions are global nitrous oxide emission hotspots&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen-rich organic soils under warm well-drained conditions are global nitrous oxide emission hotspots, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03540-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03540-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In a global field survey across a wide range of organic soils, the authors find that N2O flux can be predicted by models incorporating soil nitrate concentration (NO3–), water content and temperature.

To understand translational capacity on a genome-wide scale across three developmental stages of immature soybean seed cotyledons, ribosome profiling was performed in combination with RNA sequencing and cluster analysis. Transcripts representing 216 unique genes demonstrated a higher level of translational activity in at least one stage by exhibiting higher translational efficiencies (TEs) in which there were relatively more ribosome footprint sequence reads mapping to the transcript than were present in the control total RNA sample. The majority of these transcripts were more translationally active at the early stage of seed development and included 12 unique serine or cysteine proteases and 16 2S albumin and low molecular weight cysteine-rich proteins that may serve as substrates for turnover and mobilization early in seed development. It would appear that the serine proteases and 2S albumins play a vital role in the early stages. In contrast, our investigation of profiles of 19 genes encoding high abundance seed storage proteins, such as glycinins, beta-conglycinins, lectin, and Kunitz trypsin inhibitors, showed that they all had similar patterns in which the TE values started at low levels and increased approximately 2 to 6-fold during development. The highest levels of these seed protein transcripts were found at the mid-developmental stage, whereas the highest ribosome footprint levels of only up to 1.6 TE were found at the late developmental stage. These experimental findings suggest that the major seed storage protein coding genes are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level during normal soybean cotyledon development. Finally, our analyses also identified a total of 370 unique gene models that showed very low TE values including over 48 genes encoding ribosomal family proteins and 95 gene models that are related to energy and photosynthetic functions, many of which have homology to the chloroplast genome. Additionally, we showed that genes of the chloroplast were relatively translationally inactive during seed development.</content></content><author><name>Md.

Chronic constipation is a functional gastrointestinal disease that is detrimental to the quality of patient life. &lt;i&gt;Cassia obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; L. (CO) and &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; M. (FV) are commonly used as medicinal foods in many countries. We aimed to examine the laxative effect and their underlying mechanism of CO and FV mixture on loperamide (lop)-induced constipated rats. To determine the laxative effects of these compounds, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: the control, lop-induced constipated (2mg/kg), and three doses (100, 300, and 500mg/kg) of CO and FV mixture-, and Bisacodyl (bis, 3.3mg/kg)-treated groups. The mixture of CO and FV and bis were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks. For induction of constipation, the lop were treated with a dose of 2 mg/kg twice a day on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week after treatments of CO and FV extracts and bis. The results were revealed that the CO and FV mixture has the laxative effects more than those in CO and FV-alone treatments on constipated rats by determining the stool parameters, including stool number and weight. Indeed, stool parameters, such as, stool number, weight, and water contents and colonic peristalsis from the intestinal transit length and ratio were dramatically improved by CO and FV mixture treatment. Histological study also revealed that CO and FV mixture enhanced the thicknesses of mucosa and muscular layers of the colon in constipated rats. For their underlying mechanism, the mRNAs and proteins expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR) M2 and M3 and their downstream signaling were preserved by CO and FV mixture treatment in constipated rats. Therefore, this study suggests that treatment with CO and FV mixture has beneficial effects against constipation. We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</content></content><author><name>Seung Hee Jang</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Hee Jang, Dong Kwon Yang&lt;/p&gt;

We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Lattices for fractional Chern insulators</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/31?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a529856:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/31.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/31?rss=1</originId><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Physics</item></keywords><fingerprint>c14d57b5</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/31?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Repellin, C., Regnault, N.</name></author><published>1522950073000</published></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Expanded health systems for sustainable development</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1337?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:415040a:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1337.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1337?rss=1</originId><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bf256c60</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1337?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Dye, C.</name></author><published>1521740378000</published></item><item><engagement>27</engagement><title>Is plasticity caused by single genes?</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25495</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1626d8c9d58:6c4a593:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nature25495-f1.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>668</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25495</originId><published>1522220400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7aa165b6</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25495</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is plasticity caused by single genes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is plasticity caused by single genes?, Published online: 28 March 2018;

The Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), &lt;i&gt;Ceratitis capitata&lt;/i&gt; (Wiedemann), is a key pest of fruit crops in many tropical, subtropical and mild temperate areas worldwide. The economic importance of this fruit fly is increasing due to its invasion of new geographical areas. Efficient control and eradication efforts require adequate information regarding &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; adults in relation to environmental and physiological cues. This would allow effective characterisation of the population spatio-temporal dynamic of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; population at both the orchard level and the area-wide landscape.
The aim of this study was to analyse population patterns of adult medflies caught using two trapping systems in a peach orchard located in central Italy. They were differentiated by adult sex (males or females) and mating status of females (unmated or mated females) to determine the spatio-temporal dynamic and evaluate the effect of cultivar and chemical treatments on trap catches. Female mating status was assessed by spermathecal dissection and a blind test was carried out to evaluate the reliability of the technique. Geostatistical methods, variogram and kriging, were used to produce distributional maps. Results showed a strong correlation between the distribution of males and unmated females, whereas males versus mated females and unmated females versus mated females showed a lower correlation. Both cultivar and chemical treatments had significant effects on trap catches, showing associations with sex and female mating status. Medfly adults showed aggregated distributions in the experimental field, but hot spots locations varied. The spatial pattern of unmated females reflected that of males, whereas mated females were largely distributed around ripening or ripe fruit. The results give relevant insights into pest management. Mated females may be distributed differently to unmated females and the identification of male hot spots through monitoring would allow localisation of virgin female populations. Based on our results, a more precise IPM strategy, coupled with effective sanitation practices, could represent a more effective approach to medfly control.</content></content><author><name>Andrea Sciarretta</name></author><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Sciarretta, Maria Rosaria Tabilio, Elena Lampazzi, Claudio Ceccaroli, Marco Colacci, Pasquale Trematerra&lt;/p&gt;

That, put simply, is a different crystalline form, and any given substance can have several. Or a lot more than several. I don’t know what the record is for any single compound, but it’s way up into the dozens, and you never know when a new one might show up. You can get these different forms through all sorts of variations in the way the compound is crystallized or precipitated: different solvents, different temperatures, different types of stirring (yes indeed), different concentrations. . .and we haven’t even gotten to hydrates and solvates, where molecules of water or other solvents are incorporated into the crystal structure as it forms. And &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; can have polymorphs in turn, or different ratios of water and solvent, and there’s just no end to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymorphs can behave completely differently from each other. The same substance, completely pure, can come out looking like several unmistakable crystal types (rods, prisms, plates), in different crystalline space groups, with completely different melting points and solubility behavior. Past blog posts on this are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/10/22/phenylalanine_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/08/25/polymorphs_and_salts_india_raises_an_eyebrow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2011/01/12/gassing_your_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/04/01/novartis_loses_the_glivec_patent_fight_in_india&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and as that last one illustrates, this is definitely not something of just theoretical interest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=17333&quot;&gt;The saga&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-HIV drug Ritonavir is the classic example. That altered solubility behavior is of tremendous importance for drug dosing, and in Ritonavir’s case, a more stable (and less desirable!) polymorph appeared and threatened to disrupt the entire supply of the drug, because after a while, it was appearing more and more in the production line. “More stable”, of course, can easily mean “so stable it would rather not dissolve and get into the bloodstream”. Polymorphs themselves can be patented separately over such meaningful differences, as can methods for their production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even very simple compounds can show grindingly complex behavior. Aspirin, for example, exists in two polymorphs (so far) that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.200603373&quot;&gt;so similar&lt;/a&gt; that they can both show up &lt;em&gt;in the same single crystal&lt;/em&gt;, and it takes good X-ray data (and a good X-ray crystallographer) to work out what’s going on. One of those past blog post links is about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/blog/post-42/&quot;&gt;trickiness of phenylalanine&lt;/a&gt;, a substance you’d think had been studied to pieces by now. But as that link shows, D-ribose is in the same category: the crystallographic literature for years was all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about something even more simple than those? I refer to the most simple amino acid of all, glycine. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/anie.201800741&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has some details on its polymorphs, and the ridiculously subtle effects that cause them to form. There are three that form under “normal” conditions from aqueous solution, and while the gamma one is the most thermodynamically stable, the alpha one is kinetically favored. Adding small amounts of simple alcohols to the aqueous solution starts producing mixtures of the alpha and beta forms, though, and eventually, as the alcohol concentration goes up, you only get the beta form. All classic polymorph behavior. But why? Here’s what the authors found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Herein,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;applying&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;extremely&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;sensitive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;pyroelectric &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;measurements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;impedance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;spectroscopy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;different &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;temperatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;discovered&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;methanol,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;unlike&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;water,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;incorporated&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;polar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;within&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;bulk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;growing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-polymorph.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Consequently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;solvent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;molecules&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;create &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;polar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;domains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;exhibit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;pyroelectricity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(i.e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;they &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;develop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;temporary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;voltage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;exposed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;temperature &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;changes). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;result,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;follows&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;incorporated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;solvent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;molecules&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;operate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;conventional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“tailor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-made” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;inhibitors &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;polymorph.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that the alpha-form starts growing in a pyramidal shape, just as it usually does, but then starts incorporating methanol-solvated glycine molecules into its growing lattice. This buries methanol molecules into the crystal as it continues forming, and creates zones of higher polarity because of the different orientation of those solvated glycines (and the slight deformations in the nearest neighbor glycine arrangements as well). The normal arrangement in the crystal is a sort of “canceled-out” glycine dimer, but that gets disrupted into a more polarizable form. That’s the origin of the pyroelectric effect they’re able to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this starts happening, that developing surface of the crystal ends up “poisoned”, as some molecular dynamic simulations suggest, by the methanols incorporated into the lattice. The new surface doesn’t recognize the usual glycine-dimer form so readily, and further growth is inhibited – you see truncated pyramids of the alpha-form that have stopped in their tracks. Meanwhile, the beta-form end up with one surface (a more hydrophilic one) similarly poisoned and inhibited, but another one (a more hydrophobic one) is totally unaffected, so the crystal grows more rapidly along that face and produces long rods of the beta-form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of detail answers some questions and raises others. There are probably all sorts of metastable crystal forms (and crystal surfaces) showing up in complex polymorph situations, and the ability to see and characterize these things will (as in this case) give us a better physical picture of what’s going on. But predicting such behavior is another thing entirely. You’d hope as we start to pile up enough detail that predictive power will start to emerge (hello, machine learning). That’s a reasonable hope, but there’s no reason that things have to work out that way. The whole “Big Data” effort across various sciences is putting that view of the world to the test, and sometimes it’s going to work out and sometimes it isn’t.

Random fluctuations in the amount of cellular components like mRNA and protein molecules are inevitable due to the stochastic and discrete nature of biochemical reactions. If large enough, this so-called “cellular noise” can lead to random transitions between the expression states of a multistable genetic circuit. That way, heterogeneity within isogenic populations is created. Our aim is to understand which dynamical features of a simple autoregulatory system determine its intrinsic noise level, and how they can be modified in order to regulate state-transitions. To that end, novel mathematical methods for the state-dependent characterization and prediction of noise in multistable systems are developed. First, we introduce the hybrid LNA, a modified version of the Linear Noise Approximation. It yields good predictions on variances of mRNA and protein fluctuations, even for reaction systems comprising low-copy-number components (e.g. mRNA) and highly nonlinear reaction rates. Furthermore, the temporal structure of fluctuations and the skewness of the protein distribution are characterized via state-dependent protein burst sizes and burst frequencies. Based on this mathematical framework, we develop graphical methods which support the intuitive design of regulatory circuits with a desired noise pattern. The methods are then used to predict how overall noise in the system can be adapted, and how state-specific noise modifications are possible that allow, e.g., the generation of unidirectional transitions. Our considerations are validated by stochastic simulations. This way, a design of genetic circuits is possible that takes population heterogeneity into account and is valuable in applications of synthetic biology and biotechnology. Moreover, natural phenomena like the bimodal development of genetic competence can be studied.</content></content><author><name>Sayuri Katharina Hortsch</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Katharina Hortsch, Andreas Kremling&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Paraquat (PQ) poisoning can cause multiple organ failure, in which the lung is the primary target organ. There is currently no treatment for PQ poisoning. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which differentiate into multiple cell types, have generated much enthusiasm regarding their use for the treatment of several diseases. The aim of this study was to systematically review and analyze published preclinical studies describing MSC administration for the treatment of PQ poisoning in animal models to provide a basis for cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The electronic databases PubMed and CBMdisc were searched in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The MSC treatment characteristics of animal models of PQ poisoning were summarized. After quality assessment was performed, the effects of MSC transplantation were evaluated based on the survival rate, lung wet/dry weight, fibrosis scores, oxidative stress response, and inflammatory response. Publication bias was assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eleven controlled preclinical studies involving MSC transplantation in animal models of PQ poisoning were included in this review. MSC therapy improved the survival rate and reduced the lung wet/dry weight and histopathological fibrosis changes in most studies. MSCs decreased serum or plasma malondialdehyde levels in the acute phase after 7 and 14 d and increased serum or plasma superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels at the same time points. IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels in blood or lung tissues were decreased to different degrees by MSCs. Lung hydroxyproline was decreased by MSCs after 14 d. No obvious evidence of publication bias was found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;MSCs showed anti-fibrosis therapeutic effects in animal models of lung injury caused by PQ poisoning, which may be related to reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine levels.

The impact of agricultural practices and soil management on the communities of arthropods living in the agricultural landscape is acknowledged as a critical issue by the literature, and it needs to be better investigated to improve the ecological sustainability of agriculture. In the present study, we aimed to study how soil management affect carabid species distribution in one of the most typical agroecosystem of the Mediterranean region, i.e. the olive grove. In South Italy olive plantations feature different types of soil management, from tillage to half- or full-cover cropping. Species distribution has been examined for a total of 10,189 individuals and 62 species collected from 17 sites. Notably from our analysis we have observed that three factors (climax vegetation, soil features and soil management) explained half of the data variability. The composition of species groupings mirrors both bioclimatic conditions (climax vegetation) and soil features, especially watering, while soil management affects the species distribution, with different intensity from site to site. Eleven species have been recognized as the most abundant in the different facets of the studied olive groves and consequently designated as characteristics of the olive agroecosystem. The species traits of the sampled species have been weighted for a compelling evaluation of the effects of agricultural management on biodiversity, showing uniform traits distribution when coping with the ecological factors that characterize the different plantation facets. We have found that carabid beetles can be used as model organisms for studying the effects of agricultural practices. Our study suggests that the interaction of man-induced trasformation with the natural background of the olive agroecosystem may be difficult to disentangle, so that such complexity must be taken into account when carabid beetles are expected to provide an ecosystem service for good agricultural practices.</content></content><author><name>Roberto Pizzolotto</name></author><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roberto Pizzolotto, Antonio Mazzei, Teresa Bonacci, Stefano Scalercio, Nino Iannotta, Pietro Brandmayr&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) often experience abnormal facial growth. Three-dimensional (3D) assessment of dentofacial growth deviation has become more common with advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies. However, no standardized guidelines exist for interpretation of 3D imaging in patients with JIA. The aim of this study was to propose and validate morphometric measures for the 3D radiographic assessment of dentofacial growth deviation in patients with JIA to enhance: 1) Description of dentofacial growth deviation; 2) Treatment planning; 3) Longitudinal follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in a standardized sequential-phased approach involving: 1) Preliminary decision-making; 2) Item generation; 3) Test of content-validity; 4) Test of reliability; 5) Test of construct validity; 6) Establishment of final recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one morphometric measures were evaluated. Based on results of reliability and validity-testing including subjects with JIA (n = 70) and non-JIA controls (n = 19), seven measures received a “high recommendation” score. Those measures were associated with posterior mandibular height, occlusal cant, mandibular asymmetry, mandibular inclination, and anterior/posterior lower face height. Nine other measures were “moderately recommended” and five received a “somewhat recommendation” score.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Seven morphometric measures were considered very useful in the 3D assessment of growth deviation in patients with TMJ disease associated with JIA.

Background &lt;p&gt;Evidence remains limited on why diabetes and hypertensive patients admitted to long-term drug therapy miss doses or discontinue medication taking. We examined this phenomenon from the perspective of diabetes and hypertension patients at a Ghanaian teaching hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between July and December 2015, we conducted a qualitative study targeting caregivers and their patients with chronic diabetes and hypertensive on re-admission at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital due to non-adherence to prescribed medication. Participants were sampled purposefully and taking through in-depth interviews using an interview guide. Notes and audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, managed and coded for themes guided by the thematic network analysis recommended by Attride-Stirling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Non-adherence was the result of perceptions that the medications are not effective for managing the conditions. Patients with these perceptions rejected the medications and turned to herbal medicines and spiritual healing as therapeutic alternatives, because of their easy accessibility, perceived efficacy and affordability. Other factors identified to influence non-adherence included polypharmacy practice; tight work schedules; social norms; poor prescription instruction by health providers; and knowledge and experience of medication.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Findings suggests the need for health providers to adopt therapeutic approaches that take into account patients’ beliefs, values and norms in administering medications.

Interactions between DNA and proteins located in the cell nucleus play an important role in controlling physiological processes by specifying, augmenting and regulating context-specific transcription events. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a widely used methodology to study DNA-protein interactions and has been successfully used in various cell types for over three decades. More recently, by combining ChIP with genomic screening technologies and Next Generation Sequencing (e.g. ChIP-seq), it has become possible to profile DNA-protein interactions (including covalent histone modifications) across entire genomes. However, the applicability of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq has rarely been extended to non-model species because of a number of technical challenges. Here we report a method that can be used to identify genome wide covalent histone modifications in a group of non-model fruit fly species (Diptera: Tephritidae). The method was developed by testing and refining protocols that have been used in model organisms, including &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that this method is suitable for a group of economically important pest fruit fly species, viz., &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera dorsalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ceratitis capitata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zeugodacus cucurbitae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera tryoni&lt;/i&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;Body Mass Index (BMI), like most human phenotypes, is substantially heritable. However, BMI is not normally distributed; the skew appears to be structural, and increases as a function of age. Moreover, twin correlations for BMI commonly violate the assumptions of the most common variety of the classical twin model, with the MZ twin correlation greater than twice the DZ correlation. This study aimed to decompose twin correlations for BMI using more general skew-t distributions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Same sex MZ and DZ twin pairs (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 7,086) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry were included. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to decompose twin correlations for BMI into multiple mixture distributions. LPA was performed using the default normal mixture distribution and the skew-t mixture distribution. Similar analyses were performed for height as a comparison. Our analyses are then replicated in an independent dataset.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A two-class solution under the skew-t mixture distribution fits the BMI distribution for both genders. The first class consists of a relatively normally distributed, highly heritable BMI with a mean in the normal range. The second class is a positively skewed BMI in the overweight and obese range, with lower twin correlations. In contrast, height is normally distributed, highly heritable, and is well-fit by a single latent class. Results in the replication dataset were highly similar.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that two distinct processes underlie the skew of the BMI distribution. The contrast between height and weight is in accord with subjective psychological experience: both are under obvious genetic influence, but BMI is also subject to behavioral control, whereas height is not.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Siny Tsang</name></author><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siny Tsang, Glen E.

&lt;i&gt;Camellia nitidissima&lt;/i&gt; Chi (CNC) is a valuable medicinal and edible plant in China. In this study, CNC flowers were extracted with 95% ethanol, then partitioned into dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol, and water fractions, with the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and other phytochemicals in CNC flowers investigated for the first time. Results showed that the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity and highest total phenolic content (TPC) compared with the other fractions. Furthermore, in the ethyl acetate fraction, the 50% effective concentrations (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of ABTS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and DPPH radical scavenging activities were 64.24 ± 1.80 and 78.80 ± 0.34 μg/mL, respectively, and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was 801.49 ± 2.30 μM FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 1,000 μg/mL. Pearson’s correlation coefficients and principal component analyses (PCA) for the TPC and antioxidant capacity of the five fractions indicated that the phenolic compounds were the major antioxidant constituents in the flowers. To exploit the antioxidants in CNC flowers, 21 phenolic compounds in the ethanolic extract fraction were identified by HPLC Triple TOF MS/MS, next, 12 flavonoids were isolated and elucidated, of which compounds 1–5 showed potent antioxidant capacity. In addition, the potential structure-activity relationship among these 12 flavonoids showed that (1) the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-catechol group in the B-ring was primarily responsible for the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and (2) steric hindrance, produced by glycosides and other groups, could reduce the antioxidant capacity of the flavonoids.</content></content><author><name>Rui Yang</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rui Yang, Ying Guan, Weixin Wang, Hongjuan Chen, Zhaochun He, Ai-Qun Jia&lt;/p&gt;

A dominant mechanism in the Judgment and Decision Making literature states that information is accumulated about each choice option until a decision threshold is met. Only after that threshold does a subject start to execute a motor response to indicate their choice. However, recent research has revealed spatial gradients in motor responses as a function of comparison difficulty as well as changes-of-mind in the middle of an action, both suggesting continued accumulation and processing of decision-related signals after the decision boundary. Here we present a formal model and supporting data from a number comparison task that a continuous motor planner, combined with a simple statistical inference scheme, can model detailed behavioral effects without assuming a threshold. This threshold-free model reproduces subjects’ sensitivity to numerical distance in reaching, accuracy, reaction time, and changes of mind. We argue that the motor system positions the effectors using an optimal biomechanical feedback controller, and continuous statistical inference on outputs from cognitive processes.</content></content><author><name>Santiago Alonso-Diaz</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Santiago Alonso-Diaz, Jessica F.

Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis (FFEA) is a software package designed to perform continuum mechanics simulations of proteins and other globular macromolecules. It combines conventional finite element methods with stochastic thermal noise, and is appropriate for simulations of large proteins and protein complexes at the mesoscale (length-scales in the range of 5 nm to 1 μm), where there is currently a paucity of modelling tools. It requires 3D volumetric information as input, which can be low resolution structural information such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps or much higher resolution atomistic co-ordinates from which volumetric information can be extracted. In this article we introduce our open source software package for performing FFEA simulations which we have released under a GPLv3 license. The software package includes a C ++ implementation of FFEA, together with tools to assist the user to set up the system from Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) or Protein Data Bank (PDB) data files. We also provide a PyMOL plugin to perform basic visualisation and additional Python tools for the analysis of FFEA simulation trajectories. This manuscript provides a basic background to the FFEA method, describing the implementation of the core mechanical model and how intermolecular interactions and the solvent environment are included within this framework. We provide prospective FFEA users with a practical overview of how to set up an FFEA simulation with reference to our publicly available online tutorials and manuals that accompany this first release of the package.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hC4qKh8DkTM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Albert Solernou</name></author><crawled>1521827316353</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Albert Solernou, Benjamin S.

We provide prospective FFEA users with a practical overview of how to set up an FFEA simulation with reference to our publicly available online tutorials and manuals that accompany this first release of the package.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hC4qKh8DkTM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00218</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] A Synthetic Dual Drug Sideromycin Induces Gram-Negative Bacteria To Commit Suicide with a Gram-Positive Antibiotic</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00218</link><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_162547eb16b:489fcb:bdf8aaf1</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00218/20180323/images/medium/jm-2018-00218j_0007.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>419</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00218</originId><crawled>1521836011883</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId></origin><fingerprint>73733426</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00218/20180323/images/medium/jm-2018-00218j_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00218&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Acceptable internal consistency reliabilities, ranging from .81 to .94, were found in this sample. Approximate fit indices suggest that a correlated six first-order factor model best describes the data in contrast to theoretical considerations suggesting that a six factor model with two correlated superordinate factors (i.e., statistics anxiety and attitudes toward statistics) best describes the data.

Background &lt;p&gt;In urban Maharashtra, India, approximately half of mothers exclusively breastfeed. For children residing in informal settlements of Mumbai, this study examines factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding, and whether exclusive breastfeeding, in a community-based nutrition program to prevent and treat wasting among children under age three, is associated with enrolment during the mother’s pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The nutrition program conducted a cross-sectional endline survey (October-December 2015) of caregivers in intervention areas. Factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding for infants under six months of age were explored using multi-level logistic regressions. Additionally, program surveillance data collected during home-based counselling visits documented breastfeeding practices for children under six months of age. Using the surveillance data (January 2014-March 2016), exclusive breastfeeding status was regressed adjusting for child, maternal and socioeconomic characteristics, and whether the child was enrolled in the program in utero or after birth.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The community-based endline survey included 888 mothers of infants. Mothers who received the nutrition program home visits or attended group counselling sessions were more likely to exclusively breastfeed (adjusted odds ratio 1.67, 95% CI 1.16, 2.41). Having a normal weight-for-height z-score (adjusted odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.00, 2.45) was associated positively with exclusive breastfeeding. As expected, being an older infant aged three to five months (adjusted odds ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.25, 0.48) and receiving a prelacteal feed after birth (adjusted odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.41, 0.80) were associated with lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding. Surveillance data (N = 3420) indicate that infants enrolled in utero have significantly higher odds of being exclusively breastfed (adjusted odds ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.30, 1.84) than infants enrolled after birth.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Prenatal enrolment in community-based programs working on child nutrition in urban informal settlements of India can improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Sheila Chanani</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sheila Chanani, Anagha Waingankar, Neena Shah More, Shanti Pantvaidya, Armida Fernandez, Anuja Jayaraman&lt;/p&gt;

Neurons require a nearly constant supply of ATP. Glucose is the predominant source of brain ATP, but the direct effects of prolonged glucose deprivation on neuronal viability and function remain unclear.

Neurons require a nearly constant supply of ATP. Glucose is the predominant source of brain ATP, but the direct effects of prolonged glucose deprivation on neuronal viability and function remain unclear. In sparse rat hippocampal microcultures, neurons were surprisingly resilient to 16 h glucose removal in the absence of secondary excitotoxicity. Neuronal survival and synaptic transmission were unaffected by prolonged removal of exogenous glucose. Inhibition of lactate transport decreased microculture neuronal survival during concurrent glucose deprivation, suggesting that endogenously released lactate is important for tolerance to glucose deprivation. Tandem depolarization and glucose deprivation also reduced neuronal survival, and trace glucose concentrations afforded neuroprotection. Mass cultures, in contrast to microcultures, were insensitive to depolarizing glucose deprivation, a difference attributable to increased extracellular lactate levels. Removal of local astrocyte support did not reduce survival in response to glucose deprivation or alter evoked excitatory transmission, suggesting that on-demand, local lactate shuttling is not necessary for neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose removal. Taken together, these data suggest that endogenously produced lactate available globally in the extracellular milieu sustains neurons in the absence of glucose. A better understanding of resilience mechanisms in reduced preparations could lead to therapeutic strategies aimed to bolster these mechanisms in vulnerable neuronal populations.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Anionic water pentamer and hexamer clusters: An extensive study of structures and energetics</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025233?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f8910:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025233?af=R</originId><published>1522134684000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f2ac7a2b</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025233?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>Aslı Ünal</name></author><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03511-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>229</engagement><title>Reactive-site-centric chemoproteomics identifies a distinct class of deubiquitinase enzymes</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03511-6</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162481a768b:3566722:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-03511-6/MediaObjects/41467_2018_3511_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>659</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03511-6</originId><published>1521615600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4bd889e8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/WsdnQt0z_SE/s41467-018-03511-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reactive-site-centric chemoproteomics identifies a distinct class of deubiquitinase enzymes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reactive-site-centric chemoproteomics identifies a distinct class of deubiquitinase enzymes, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03511-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03511-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Deubiquitinases are proteases that cleave after the C-terminus of ubiquitin to hydrolyze ubiquitin chains and cleave ubiquitin from substrates.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Using our previously developed and tested Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Stigma Scale, we investigated factors associated with perceived SRH stigma among adolescent girls in Ghana.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We drew upon data from our survey study of 1,063 females 15-24yrs recruited from community- and clinic-based sites in two Ghanaian cities. Our Adolescent SRH Stigma Scale comprised 20 items and 3 sub-scales (Internalized, Enacted, Lay Attitudes) to measure stigma occurring with sexual activity, contraceptive use, pregnancy, abortion and family planning service use. We assessed relationships between a comprehensive set of demographic, health and social factors and SRH Stigma with multi-level multivariable linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In unadjusted bivariate analyses, compared to their counterparts, SRH stigma scores were higher among girls who were younger, Accra residents, Muslim, still in/dropped out of secondary school, unemployed, reporting excellent/very good health, not in a relationship, not sexually experienced, never received family planning services, never used contraception, but had been pregnant (all p-values &amp;lt;0.05). In multivariable models, higher SRH stigma scores were associated with history of pregnancy (β = 1.53, CI = 0.51,2.56) and excellent/very good self-rated health (β = 0.89, CI = 0.20,1.58), while lower stigma scores were associated with older age (β = -0.17, 95%CI = -0.24,-0.09), higher educational attainment (β = -1.22, CI = -1.82,-0.63), and sexual intercourse experience (β = -1.32, CI = -2.10,-0.55).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings provide insight into factors contributing to SRH stigma among this young Ghanaian female sample.

Background &amp;amp; aims &lt;p&gt;To determine the prognostic potential of classic and novel serologic antibodies regarding unfavorable disease course in a prospective ulcerative colitis (UC) patient cohort, since few and conflicting data are available in the literature regarding this matter.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;187 consecutive patients were studied prospectively (median follow-up: 135 months) from a single referral IBD center in Hungary. Sera were tested for different IgA/IgG type autoantibodies (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic [ANCA], anti-DNA-bound-lactoferrin [anti-LFS], anti-goblet cell [anti-GAB] and anti-pancreatic [PAB: anti-CUZD1 and anti-GP2)]) by indirect immunofluorescence technique and for anti-microbial (anti-&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; [ASCA] IgG/IgA and anti-OMP Plus&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; IgA) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 73.6%, 62.4% and 11.2% of UC patients were positive for IgA/IgG type of atypical perinuclear-ANCA, anti-LFS and anti-GAB, respectively. Occurrences of PABs were 9.6%, while ASCA IgA/IgG and anti-OMP IgA were 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Antibody status was stable over time. IgA type PABs were more prevalent in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (37.5% vs. 4.7% for anti-CUZD1 and 12.5% vs. 0% for anti-GP2, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt; for both). IgA type ASCA and anti-CUZD1 antibodies were associated with higher risk of requirement for long-term immunosuppressant therapy in Kaplan-Meier analysis (pLogRank &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt; for both). However, in multivariate Cox-regression analysis only ASCA IgA (HR: 2.74, 95%CI: 1.46–5.14, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;) remained independent predictor. UC-related hospitalization due to disease activity was only associated with multiple antibody positivity (for 3 or more; HR 2.03 [95% CI: 1.16–3.56]; p = 0.013). None of the individual antibodies or their combination was associated with the risk of development of extensive disease or colectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Even with low prevalence rates, present study gives further evidence to the role of certain antibodies as markers for distinct phenotype and disease outcome in UC.

Investigation of human diet during the Neolithic has often been limited to a few archaeological cultures or single sites. In order to provide insight into the development of human food consumption and husbandry strategies, our study explores bone collagen carbon and nitrogen isotope data from 466 human and 105 faunal individuals from 26 sites in central Germany. It is the most extensive data set to date from an enclosed geographic microregion, covering 4,000 years of agricultural history from the Early Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. The animal data show that a variety of pastures and dietary resources were explored, but that these changed remarkably little over time. In the human &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N however we found a significant increase with time across the different archaeological cultures. This trend could be observed in all time periods and archaeological cultures (Bell Beaker phenomenon excluded), even on continuously populated sites. Since there was no such trend in faunal isotope values, we were able largely to exclude manuring as the cause of this effect. Based on the rich interdisciplinary data from this region and archaeological period we can argue that meat consumption increased with the increasing duration of farming subsistence.
In &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, we could not observe any clear increasing or decreasing trends during the archaeological time periods, either for humans or for animals, which would have suggested significant changes in the environment and landscape use. We discovered sex-related dietary differences, with males of all archaeological periods having higher &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N values than females, and an age-related increasing consumption of animal protein. An initial decrease of &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-values at the age of 1–2 years reveals partial weaning, while complete weaning took place at the age of 3–4 years.</content></content><author><name>Angelina Münster</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Angelina Münster, Corina Knipper, Vicky M.

Prefrontal anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed as a potential approach to improve inhibitory control performance. The functional consequences of tDCS during inhibition tasks remain, however, largely unresolved. We addressed this question by analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recorded while participants completed a Go/NoGo task after right-lateralized prefrontal anodal tDCS with a crossover, sham-controlled, double-blind experimental design. We replicated previous evidence for an absence of offline effect of anodal stimulation on Go/NoGo performance. The fMRI results revealed a larger increase in right ventrolateral prefrontal activity for Go than NoGo trials in the anodal than sham condition. This pattern suggests that tDCS-induced increases in cortical excitability have larger effects on fMRI activity in regions with a lower task-related engagement. This was the case for the right prefrontal cortex in the Go condition in our task because while reactive inhibition was not engaged during execution trials, the unpredictability of the demand for inhibitory control still incited an engagement of proactive inhibition. Exploratory analyses further revealed that right prefrontal stimulation interacted with task-related functional demands in the supplementary motor area and the thalamus. Our collective results emphasize the dependency of offline tDCS functional effects on the task-related engagement of the stimulated areas and suggest that this factor might partly account for the discrepancies in the functional effects of tDCS observed in previous studies.</content></content><author><name>Etienne Sallard</name></author><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Etienne Sallard, Michael Mouthon, Michael De Pretto, Lucas Spierer&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Despite successful virological suppression, HIV transcription frequently persists intracellularly. In this study, we hypothesize that HIV persistent transcription(HIVpt) may affect to a different extent patients on stable efavirenz(EFV) versus atazanavir(ATV)-based regimens. The role of the expression of drug efflux transporters in HIVpt was also investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We prospectively enrolled 51 virologically suppressed patients on first-line treatment for one year with EFV or ATV combined with emtricitabine and tenofovir and followed them up for one year. Simultaneous ultrasensitive subpopulation staining/hybridization in situ(SUSHI) was performed to identify HIVpt in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells and in the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45RO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell subpopulation. The differential mRNA expression of P-glycoprotein(P-gp/ABCB1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein-1(MRP1/ABCC1) was also evaluated. Univariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate predictors of HIVpt.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell population, HIVpt affected 13/30 of patients on EFV versus 10/21 on ATV. In the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45RO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell population, HIVpt was present in 14/30 of patients on EFV versus 15/21 on ATV. A trend for association was observed between the risk of HIVpt and ATV treatment in the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45RO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell population (OR 2.86, 95% CI 0.87–9.37, p = 0.083). HIVpt status was not associated with loss of virological suppression or CD4 evolution. We found no evidence of differential expression of the drug efflux transporters P-gp and MRP1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Further study is required to evaluate whether the HIVpt profile in specific cell populations may differ across different antiretroviral regimens and to elucidate the potential clinical impact.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Dimitrios Pilalas</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dimitrios Pilalas, Lemonia Skoura, Apostolia Margariti, Fani Chatzopoulou, Dimitrios Chatzidimitriou, Olga Tsachouridou, Pantelis Zebekakis, Simeon Metallidis, Maria Papaioannou&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite decades of efforts to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) in the United States (US), TB still contributes to adverse ill health, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2016, about 87% of the TB cases reported in the US were among racial and ethnic minorities. The objective of this study is to explore the risks for pregnancy complications and in-hospital death among mothers diagnosed with TB across racial/ethnic groups in the US.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized National Inpatient Sample data for all inpatient hospital discharges in the US. We analyzed pregnancy-related hospitalizations and births in the US from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2014 (n = 57,393,459). Multivariable logistic regression was applied to generate odds ratios for the association between TB status and the primary study outcomes (i.e., pregnancy complications and in-hospital death) across racial/ethnic categories.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of TB was 7.1 per 100,000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations. The overall prevalence of pregnancy complications was 80% greater among TB-infected mothers than their uninfected counterparts. Severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, placenta previa, post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis and anemia occurred with greater frequency among mothers with a TB diagnosis than those without TB, irrespective of race/ethnicity. The rate of in-hospital death among TB patients was 37 times greater among TB-infected than in non-TB infected mothers (468.8 per 100,000 versus 12.6 per 100,000). A 3-fold increased risk of in-hospital death was observed among black TB-negative mothers compared to their white counterparts. No racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity or in-hospital death were found among mothers with TB disease.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;TB continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women in the US. Resources to address TB disease should also target pregnant women, especially racial/ethnic minorities who bear the greatest burden of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Erika M.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Systematic review of research examining consumer preference for the main electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) attributes namely flavor, nicotine strength, and type.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles resulted in a pool of 12,933 articles. We included only articles that meet all the selection criteria: (1) peer-reviewed, (2) written in English, and (3) addressed consumer preference for one or more of the e-cigarette attributes including flavor, strength, and type.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;66 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Consumers preferred flavored e-cigarettes, and such preference varied with age groups and smoking status. We also found that several flavors were associated with decreased harm perception while tobacco flavor was associated with increased harm perception. In addition, some flavor chemicals and sweeteners used in e-cigarettes could be of toxicological concern. Finally, consumer preference for nicotine strength and types depended on smoking status, e-cigarette use history, and gender.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Adolescents could consider flavor the most important factor trying e-cigarettes and were more likely to initiate vaping through flavored e-cigarettes. Young adults overall preferred sweet, menthol, and cherry flavors, while non-smokers in particular preferred coffee and menthol flavors. Adults in general also preferred sweet flavors (though smokers like tobacco flavor the most) and disliked flavors that elicit bitterness or harshness. In terms of whether flavored e-cigarettes assisted quitting smoking, we found inconclusive evidence. E-cigarette users likely initiated use with a cigarette like product and transitioned to an advanced system with more features.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Systematic review of research examining consumer preference for the main electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) attributes namely flavor, nicotine strength, and type.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles resulted in a pool of 12,933 articles. We included only articles that meet all the selection criteria: (1) peer-reviewed, (2) written in English, and (3) addressed consumer preference for one or more of the e-cigarette attributes including flavor, strength, and type.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;66 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Consumers preferred flavored e-cigarettes, and such preference varied with age groups and smoking status. We also found that several flavors were associated with decreased harm perception while tobacco flavor was associated with increased harm perception. In addition, some flavor chemicals and sweeteners used in e-cigarettes could be of toxicological concern. Finally, consumer preference for nicotine strength and types depended on smoking status, e-cigarette use history, and gender.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Adolescents could consider flavor the most important factor trying e-cigarettes and were more likely to initiate vaping through flavored e-cigarettes. Young adults overall preferred sweet, menthol, and cherry flavors, while non-smokers in particular preferred coffee and menthol flavors. Adults in general also preferred sweet flavors (though smokers like tobacco flavor the most) and disliked flavors that elicit bitterness or harshness. In terms of whether flavored e-cigarettes assisted quitting smoking, we found inconclusive evidence. E-cigarette users likely initiated use with a cigarette like product and transitioned to an advanced system with more features. Non-smokers and inexperienced e-cigarettes users tended to prefer no nicotine or low nicotine e-cigarettes while smokers and experienced e-cigarettes users preferred medium and high nicotine e-cigarettes. Weak evidence exists regarding a positive interaction between menthol flavor and nicotine strength.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>153</engagement><title>AI diagnostics need attention</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03067-x</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162202432ec:56580b:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03067-x/d41586-018-03067-x_15526736.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03067-x</originId><crawled>1520957666028</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>54f6f104</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03067-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI diagnostics need attention&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI diagnostics need attention, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03067-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03067-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Computer algorithms to detect disease show great promise, but they must be developed and applied with care.</content></content><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1520924400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI diagnostics need attention&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI diagnostics need attention, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03067-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03067-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Computer algorithms to detect disease show great promise, but they must be developed and applied with care.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Effects of polyaluminum chloride and lanthanum-modified bentonite on the growth rates of three &amp;lt;i&gt;Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii&amp;lt;/i&gt; strains</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195359</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6d:34f43e70</id><updated>1522789200000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195359</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195359</originId><published>1522789200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9e2682a2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195359</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fabiana Araújo, Frank van Oosterhout, Vanessa Becker, José Luiz Attayde, Miquel Lürling&lt;/p&gt;
In tropical and subtropical lakes, eutrophication often leads to nuisance blooms of &lt;i&gt;Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii&lt;/i&gt;. In laboratory experiments, we tested the combined effects of flocculant polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB) on the sinking and growth rates of three &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of PAC and LMB would (1) effectively sink &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; in a test tube experiment and (2) impair &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; growth, irrespective of the biomass of the inoculum (bloom) and the strain in the growth experiment. We tested the recommended (LMB1) and a three-times higher dose of LMB (LMB3). The combined addition of PAC and LMB enhanced the sedimentation of all &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. Moreover, both the PAC and LMB doses decreased the phosphate concentration. PAC and LMB1 decreased the growth rate of all strains, but the efficacy depended on the biomass and strain. The combined addition of PAC and LMB3 inhibited the growth of all strains independently of the biomass and strain. We conclude that a low dose of PAC in combination with the recommended dose of LMB decreases &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; blooms and that the efficiency of the technique depends on the biomass of the bloom.

The critically endangered Northern bald ibis (&lt;i&gt;Geronticus eremita&lt;/i&gt;) is a migratory bird that became extinct in Europe centuries ago. Since 2014, the Northern bald ibis is subject to an intensive rehabilitation and conservation regime aiming to reintroduce the bird in its original distribution range in Central Europe and concurrently to maintain bird health and increase population size. Hitherto, virtually nothing is known about the microbial communities associated with the ibis species; an information pivotal for the veterinary management of these birds. Hence, the present study was conducted to provide a baseline description of the cultivable microbiota residing in the Northern bald ibis. Samples derived from the choana, trachea, crop and cloaca were examined employing a culturomic approach in order to identify microbes at each sampling site and to compare their frequency among age classes, seasonal appearances and rearing types. In total, 94 microbial species including 14 potentially new bacterial taxa were cultivated from the Northern bald ibis with 36, 58 and 59 bacterial species isolated from the choana, crop and cloaca, respectively. The microbiota of the Northern bald ibis was dominated by members of the phylum &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, followed by &lt;i&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fusobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, altogether phylotypes commonly observed within avian gut environments. Differences in relative abundances of various microbial taxa were evident among sample types indicating mucosa-specific colonisation properties and tissue tropism. Besides, results of the present study indicate that the composition of microbiota was also affected by age, season (environment) and rearing type. While the prevalence of traditional pathogenic microbial species was extremely low, several opportunists including &lt;i&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/i&gt; toxotype A were frequently present in samples indicating that the Northern bald ibis may represent an important animal reservoir for these pathogens. In summary, the presented study provides a first inventory of the cultivable microbiota residing in the critically endangered Northern bald ibis and represents a first step in a wider investigation of the ibis microbiome with the ultimate goal to contribute to the management and survival of this critically endangered bird.</content></content><author><name>Joachim Spergser</name></author><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joachim Spergser, Igor Loncaric, Alexander Tichy, Johannes Fritz, Alexandra Scope&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to analyze the position of the lumbopelvic region and the muscle activation of erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles in a group of pregnant women in the third trimester. The hypothesis was that pregnancy-related biomechanical and morphological changes modify the position of the lumbopelvic region and the activation of extensor muscles. The position of the lumbar spine and pelvis in the sagittal plane, and the EMG activity of the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles, were recorded during standing in 34 nulliparous and 34 pregnant women in the third trimester, and also two months after birth in the group of pregnant women. No significant differences in the position of the lumbar spine or pelvis between the group of pregnant women and nulliparous or postpartum were observed. A significant increase was observed in the EMG activity of the erector spinae (4.6% vs 2.4% and 2.1% in the nulliparous group and postpartum respectively) and the biceps femoris (3.4% vs 1.2% and 1.4%) in pregnant women compared to the other two groups (p &amp;lt;0.01). We conclude that pregnant women in the third trimester show no alterations in lumbopelvic position compared to nulliparous and postpartum women. However, there is an increase of the EMG activity of the trunk extensors. These results indicate that the extensor muscles of the trunk show, in static positions, adaptive responses to the increase of anterior loads during pregnancy.</content></content><author><name>Gemma Biviá-Roig</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gemma Biviá-Roig, Juan Francisco Lisón, Daniel Sánchez-Zuriaga&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Data on implications of a high positive titer of serum anti-&lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; antibody on gastric cancer (GC) is limited. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of GC with a high serum anti-&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; IgG (Hp-IgG) titer, and its association with diffuse-type GC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical and histological characteristics of 917 non-cardia GC patients who underwent gastrectomy. &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection was determined serologically by measuring Hp-IgG titer with immunoassay. Seropositive patients were divided into three groups (low-positive, mid-positive, and high-positive) according to the Hp-IgG titer value. Tumors were classified according to the Lauren criteria as diffuse or intestinal types.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median age of the patients was 59.0 years, and 33.8% were female. The patents were grouped as follows: seronegative, 188 (20.5%); low-positive, 288 (31.4%); mid-positive, 290 (31.6%); and high-positive 151 (16.5%). The high-positive group was significantly younger (median age, 55.0 years), with a higher proportion of female (45.0%) and non-smokers (58.9%). The proportion of diffuse-type GC increased in the order low-, mid-, and high-positive groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). In univariate analysis, the factors associated with diffuse-type GC were younger age, female sex, non-smokers, and a high-positive Hp-IgG titer. Younger age, female sex, and non-smokers remained significant on multivariate analysis whereas the high-positive Hp-IgG titer showed only a tendency toward the association (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.078).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Non-cardia GC patients with a high Hp-IgG titer have distinct clinicopathologic characteristics.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Influenza vaccination can prevent influenza and potentially serious influenza-related complications. Although the single best way to prevent influenza is annual vaccination, everyday preventive actions, including good hygiene, health, dietary, and social habits, might help, too. Several preventive measures are recommended, including: avoiding close contact with people who are sick; staying home when sick; covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing; washing your hands often; avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; and practicing other good health habits like cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, getting plenty of sleep, and drinking plenty of fluids. Understanding public acceptance and current usage of these preventive behaviors can be useful for planning both seasonal and pandemic influenza prevention campaigns. This study estimated the percentage of adults in the United States who reported practicing preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza, and explored associations of reported behaviors with sociodemographic factors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from 2015 National Internet Flu Survey, a nationally representative probability-based Internet panel survey of the non-institutionalized U.S. population ≥18 years. The self-reported behaviors used to avoid catching or spreading influenza were grouped into four and three non-mutually exclusive subgroups, respectively. Weighted proportions were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted prevalence differences and to determine independent associations between sociodemographic characteristics and preventive behavior subgroups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Common preventive behaviors reported were: 83.2% wash hands often, 80.0% cover coughs and sneezes, 78.2% stay home if sick with a respiratory illness, 64.4% avoid people sick with a respiratory illness, 51.7% use hand sanitizers, 50.2% get treatment as soon as possible, and 49.8% report getting the influenza vaccination. Race/ethnicity, gender, age, education, income, region, receipt of influenza vaccination, and household size were associated with use of preventive behaviors after controlling for other factors.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Many adults in the United States reported using preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza. Though vaccination is the most important tool available to prevent influenza, the addition of preventive behaviors might play an effective role in reducing or slowing transmission of influenza and complement prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Anup Srivastav</name></author><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anup Srivastav, Tammy A.

Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted prevalence differences and to determine independent associations between sociodemographic characteristics and preventive behavior subgroups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Common preventive behaviors reported were: 83.2% wash hands often, 80.0% cover coughs and sneezes, 78.2% stay home if sick with a respiratory illness, 64.4% avoid people sick with a respiratory illness, 51.7% use hand sanitizers, 50.2% get treatment as soon as possible, and 49.8% report getting the influenza vaccination. Race/ethnicity, gender, age, education, income, region, receipt of influenza vaccination, and household size were associated with use of preventive behaviors after controlling for other factors.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Many adults in the United States reported using preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza. Though vaccination is the most important tool available to prevent influenza, the addition of preventive behaviors might play an effective role in reducing or slowing transmission of influenza and complement prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>114</engagement><title>A mouse model for evaluation of efficacy and concomitant toxicity of anti-human CXCR4 therapeutics</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194688</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f8907:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1521493200000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194688</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194688</originId><published>1521493200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1052c34b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194688</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria José Costa, Jyothirmayee Kudaravalli, Wen-Hui Liu, Jeffrey Stock, Sophanna Kong, Shu-Hui Liu&lt;/p&gt;
The development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies through mouse immunization often originates drug candidates that are not cross-reactive to the mouse ortholog. In such cases, and particularly in oncology, drug efficacy studies are performed on human tumor xenografts or with “surrogate” anti-mouse ortholog antibodies if targeting tumor host cells. Safety assessment of drug candidate(s) is performed at a later development stage in healthy non-human primates. While the latter remains necessary before a drug advances into human subjects, it precludes evaluation of safety in disease conditions and drug de-risking during early development. Therefore, mouse models that allow concomitant evaluation of drug efficacy and safety are highly desirable. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is an attractive target for tumor-targeted and immuno-oncology therapeutics, with multiple mouse immunization-derived antibodies undergoing clinical trials. Given the pleiotropic role of CXCR4 in cancer biology, we anticipate continuous interest in this target, particularly in the testing of therapeutic combinations for immuno-oncology. Here, we describe the generation and validation of the first mouse knock-in of the whole coding region of human CXCR4. Homozygous human CXCR4 knock-in (hereafter designated as HuCXCR4KI) mice were viable and outwardly healthy, reproduced normally and nursed their young. The expression pattern of human CXCR4 in this model was similar to that of CXCR4 expression in normal human tissues. The human CXCR4 knock-in gene was expressed as a biologically active protein, thereby allowing normal animal development and adequate”homing” of leukocytes to the bone marrow. To further validate our model, we used an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; functional assay of leukocyte mobilization from bone marrow to peripheral blood by blocking CXCR4 signaling. Both an anti-human CXCR4 -specific blocking antibody and the small molecule CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 induced increased leukocyte counts in peripheral blood, whereas an anti-mouse CXCR4 –specific blocking antibody had no effect. This new mouse model is useful to evaluate efficacy and safety of anti-human CXCR4 -specific drugs as single agents or in combination therapies, particularly in the oncology, immuno-oncology, wound healing and chronic inflammation therapeutic areas.</content></content><author><name>Maria José Costa</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria José Costa, Jyothirmayee Kudaravalli, Wen-Hui Liu, Jeffrey Stock, Sophanna Kong, Shu-Hui Liu&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper we explored the effects of exposure to images of the suffering and vulnerability of others on altruistic, trust-based, and reciprocated incentivized economic decisions, accounting for differences in participants’ dispositional empathy and reported in-group trust for their recipient(s). This was done using a pictorial priming task, framed as a memory test, and a triadic economic game design. Using the largest experimental sample to date to explore this issue, our integrated analysis of two online experiments (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 519), found statistically consistent evidence that exposure to images of suffering and vulnerability (vs. neutral images) increased altruistic in-group giving as measured by the “triple dictator game”, and that the manipulation was significantly more effective in those who reported lower trust for their recipients. The experimental manipulation also significantly increased altruistic giving in the standard “dictator game” and trust-based giving in the “investment game”, but only in those who were lower in in-group trust and also high in affective or cognitive empathy. Complementary qualitative evidence revealed the strongest motivations associated with increased giving in the experimental condition were greater assumed reciprocation and a lower aversion to risk. However, no consistent effects of the experimental manipulation on participants’ reciprocated decisions were observed. These findings suggest that, as well as altruistic decision-making in the “triple dictator game”, collaboratively witnessing the suffering of others may heighten trust-based in-group giving in the “investment game” for some people, but the effects are heterogeneous and sensitive to context.</content></content><author><name>Philip A.

Current approaches for DNA extraction and fragmentation from mammalian spermatozoa provide several challenges for the investigation of the oxidative stress burden carried in the genome of male gametes. Indeed, the potential introduction of oxidative DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species, reducing agents (dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol), and DNA shearing techniques used in the preparation of samples for chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing serve to cofound the reliability and accuracy of the results obtained. Here we report optimised methodology that minimises, or completely eliminates, exposure to DNA damaging compounds during extraction and fragmentation procedures. Specifically, we show that Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion prior to cellular lysis generates a greater DNA yield with minimal collateral oxidation while randomly fragmenting the entire paternal genome. This modified methodology represents a significant improvement over traditional fragmentation achieved via sonication in the preparation of genomic DNA from human spermatozoa for downstream applications, such as next-generation sequencing. We also present a redesigned bioinformatic pipeline framework adjusted to correctly analyse this form of data and detect statistically relevant targets of oxidation.</content></content><author><name>Miguel J.

Dietary energy intake strongly linked to dialysis outcomes. We aimed to explore the optimal cut-off point of energy intake (EI) for identification of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in hemodialysis patients. The cross-sectional data of 243 hemodialysis patients from multi-dialysis centers in Taiwan was used. The dietary intake was assessed by using the three-day dietary questionnaire, and a 24-hour dietary recall, clinical and biochemical data were also evaluated. The MetS was diagnosed by the Harmonized Metabolic Syndrome criteria. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was to depict the optimal cut-off value of EI for the diagnosis of MetS. The logistic regression was also used to explore the association between inadequate EI and MetS. The optimal cut-off points of EI for identifying the MetS were 26.7 kcal/kg/day for patients aged less than 60 years, or with non-diabetes, and 26.2 kcal/kg/day for patients aged 60 years and above, or with diabetes, respectively. The likelihood of the MetS increased with lower percentiles of energy intake in hemodialysis patients. In the multivariate analysis, the inadequate dietary energy intake strongly determined 3.24 folds of the MetS. The assessment of dietary EI can help healthcare providers detecting patients who are at risk of metabolic syndrome.</content></content><author><name>Tuyen Van Duong</name></author><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tuyen Van Duong, Te-Chih Wong, Hsi-Hsien Chen, Tzen-Wen Chen, Tso-Hsiao Chen, Yung-Ho Hsu, Sheng-Jeng Peng, Ko-Lin Kuo, Chi-Sin Wang, I-Hsin Tseng, Yi-Wei Feng, Tai-Yue Chang, Chien-Tien Su, Shwu-Huey Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Our results indicate that using sensitivity levels is feasible to optimize the performance of privacy preserving alignment, if one combines the advantages of private and public clouds.</description></item><item><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25154?af=R</link><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162656b8f8b:6ce11:76251cdd</id><unread>False</unread><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25154?af=R</originId><published>1522119970699</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>517be12d</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25154?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1522119970699</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>The effect of pond dyes on oviposition and survival in wild UK &amp;lt;i&gt;Culex&amp;lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2804:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1522270800000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</originId><published>1522270800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>38533848</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Natali Ortiz-Perea, Rebecca Gander, Oliver Abbey, Amanda Callaghan&lt;/p&gt;
British &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; complex [&lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato) mosquito distribution, abundance, and potential for disease transmission are intimately linked to their environment. Pond and lake dyes that block light to restrict algal photosynthesis are a relatively new product assumed to be an environmentally friendly since they are based on food dyes. Their use in urban garden ponds raises questions linked to mosquito oviposition, since coloured water can be an attractant. &lt;i&gt;Culex (&lt;/i&gt;mostly &lt;i&gt;pipiens)&lt;/i&gt; is commonly found in UK gardens and is a potential vector of viruses including the West Nile Virus (WNV). Any factors that significantly change the distribution and population of &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; could impact future risks of disease transmission. A gravid trap was used to catch female &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes for use in oviposition choice tests in laboratory and semi-field conditions. Two types of pond dye, blue and shadow (which looks slightly red), were tested for their impact on oviposition and survival of wild caught &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt;. There were no significant differences in the number of egg batches laid when gravid mosquitoes were given a choice between either blue dye and clear water or shadow dye and clear water indicating that these dyes are not attractants. Larvae hatched from egg batches laid by wild-caught gravid females were used to measure survival to adulthood with or without dye, in a habitat controlled to prevent further colonisation. The experiment was run twice, once in the summer and again in the autumn, whereas the dyes had no impact on emergence in the summer, there were highly significant reductions in emergence of adults in both dye treated habitats in the autumn. Containers with or without shadow dye were placed outside to colonise naturally and were sampled weekly for larvae and pupae over a 6 month period through summer and autumn. There was a significant negative effect of shadow dye on pupal abundance in a three week period over the summer, but otherwise there was no effect. It is likely that population abundance and food was a more powerful factor for mosquito survival than the dye.</content></content><author><name>Natali Ortiz-Perea</name></author><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Natali Ortiz-Perea, Rebecca Gander, Oliver Abbey, Amanda Callaghan&lt;/p&gt;

We investigate the influence of the visual appearance of a negotiator on persuasiveness within the context of negotiations. Psychological experiments were conducted to quantitatively analyze the relationship between visual appearance and the use of language. Male and female participants were shown three female and male photographs, respectively. They were asked to report how they felt about each photograph using a seven-point semantic differential (SD) scale for six affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness). Participants then answered how they felt about each negotiation scenario (they were presented with pictures and a situation combined with negotiation sentences) using a seven-point SD scale for seven affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, and degree of persuasion). Two experiments were conducted using different participant groups depending on the negotiation situations. Photographs with good or bad appearances were found to show high or low degrees of persuasion, respectively. A multiple regression equation was obtained, indicating the importance of the three language factors (euphemistic, honorific, and sympathy expressions) to impressions made during negotiation. The result shows that there are optimal negotiation sentences based on various negotiation factors, such as visual appearance and use of language. For example, persons with good appearance might worsen their impression during negotiations by using certain language, although their initial impression was positive, and persons with bad appearance could effectively improve their impressions in negotiations through their use of language, although the final impressions of their negotiation counterpart might still be more negative than those for persons with good appearance. In contrast, the impressions made by persons of normal appearance were not easily affected by their use of language. The results of the present study have significant implications for future studies of effective negotiation strategies considering visual appearance as well as gender.</content></content><author><name>Maki Sakamoto</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maki Sakamoto, Jinhwan Kwon, Hikaru Tamada, Yumi Hirahara&lt;/p&gt;

Strategic purchasing is an essential health financing function. This paper compares the strategic purchasing practices of Thailand’s two tax-financed health insurance schemes, the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), and identifies factors contributing to successful universal health coverage outcomes by analysing the relationships between the purchaser and government, providers and members. The study uses a cross-sectional mixed-methods design, including document review and interviews with 56 key informants. The Comptroller General Department (CGD) of Ministry of Finance manages CSMBS as one among civil servant welfare programmes. Their purchasing is passive. Fee for service payment for outpatient care has resulted in rapid cost escalation and overspending of their annual budget. In contrast, National Health Security Office (NHSO) manages purchasing for UCS, which undertakes a range of strategic purchasing actions, including applying closed ended provider payment, promoting primary healthcare’s gate keeping functions, exercising collective purchasing power and engaging views of members in decision making process. This difference in purchasing arrangements resulted in expenditure per CSMBS member being 4 times higher than UCS in 2014. The governance of the purchaser organization, the design of the purchasing arrangements including incentives and use of information, and the institutional capacities to implement purchasing functions are essential for effective strategic purchasing which can improve health system efficiency as a whole.</content></content><author><name>Walaiporn Patcharanarumol</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Walaiporn Patcharanarumol, Warisa Panichkriangkrai, Angkana Sommanuttaweechai, Kara Hanson, Yaowaluk Wanwong, Viroj Tangcharoensathien&lt;/p&gt;

Biomechanical studies have shown the use of suture anchors (SA) to be superior to the traditional transosseous sutures (TS) in the repair of quadriceps tendon rupture (QTR). This study aimed to analyze and compare the functional outcomes of patients treated for quadriceps tendon ruptures using suture anchors or transosseous sutures. Patients having undergone suture anchor repair or transosseous suture repair for quadriceps tendon rupture between 2010 and 2015 at one of the two participating hospitals were included.

Biomechanical studies have shown the use of suture anchors (SA) to be superior to the traditional transosseous sutures (TS) in the repair of quadriceps tendon rupture (QTR). This study aimed to analyze and compare the functional outcomes of patients treated for quadriceps tendon ruptures using suture anchors or transosseous sutures. Patients having undergone suture anchor repair or transosseous suture repair for quadriceps tendon rupture between 2010 and 2015 at one of the two participating hospitals were included. Patients from site A underwent TS repair (TS group) while patients from site B underwent SA repair (SA group). Exclusion criteria included previous or concomitant injuries of the involved knee, penetrating injuries and pre-existing neurological conditions. Clinical outcome was assessed by subjective scores (Lysholm and Tegner Scores, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Score, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain), quadriceps isokinetic strength testing, Insall-Salvati Index (ISI), and physical examination. Non-parametrical statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; test. Twenty-seven patients were included in the study of which 17 patients (63%) were available for follow-up (SA group: 9, TS group: 8). All patients were male with a mean age of 62.7 (SD: 8.8) and 57.9 (SD: 12.7) years for the SA group and TS group, respectively. The groups did not differ in terms of demographic characteristics. No clinically significant differences were identified between the two groups. There were no re-ruptures in either group. Treatment of quadriceps tendon rupture using suture anchors provides a clinically valid alternative treatment to the gold-standard transosseous suture repair.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Mid-life psychosocial work environment as a predictor of work exit by age 50</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195495</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d738:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1522962000000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195495</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195495</originId><published>1522962000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d15b92ae</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195495</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stephen A.

Gari, a fermented and dried semolina made from cassava, is one of the most common foods in West Africa. Recently introduced biofortified yellow cassava containing provitamin A carotenoids could help tackle vitamin A deficiency prevalent in those areas. However there are concerns because of the low retention of carotenoids during gari processing compared to other processes (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. boiling). The aim of the study was to assess the levels of true retention in &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;–β-carotene during gari processing and investigate the causes of low retention. Influence of processing step, processor (3 commercial processors) and variety (TMS 01/1371; 01/1368 and 01/1412) were assessed. It was shown that low true retention (46% on average) during gari processing may be explained by not only chemical losses (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. due to roasting temperature) but also by physical losses (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. due to leaching of carotenoids in discarded liquids): true retention in the liquid lost from grating negatively correlated with true retention retained in the mash (R = -0.914). Moreover, true retention followed the same pattern as lost water at the different processing steps (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. for the commercial processors). Variety had a significant influence on true retention, carotenoid content, and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerisation but the processor type had little effect. It is the first time that the importance of physical carotenoid losses was demonstrated during processing of biofortified crops.</content></content><author><name>Aurélie Bechoff</name></author><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aurélie Bechoff, Keith Ian Tomlins, Ugo Chijioke, Paul Ilona, Andrew Westby, Erick Boy&lt;/p&gt;

Recent comparative genomics studies have suggested that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of the major processes in bacterial evolution. In this study, HGT events of 64 &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; strains were investigated based on the pipeline employed in HGTree database constructed in our recent study. Tree reconciliation method was applied in order to calculate feasible HGT events. Following initial detection and an evaluation procedure, evidence of the HGT was identified in 548 gene families including 42 gene families transferred from outside of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydiae&lt;/i&gt; phylum with high reliability. The donor species of inter-phylum HGT consists of 12 different bacterial and archaeal phyla, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; might have even more various host range than in previous reports. In addition, each species of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; showed varying preference towards HGT, and genes engaged in HGT within &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; and between other species showed different functional distribution. Also, examination of individual gene flows of niche-specific genes suggested that many of such genes are transferred mainly within &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genus. Our results uncovered novel features of HGT acting on &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genome evolution, and it would be also strong evidence that HGT is an ongoing process for intracellular pathogens. We expect that the results provide more insight into lineage- and niche-specific adaptations regarding their infectivity and pathogenicity.</content></content><author><name>Hyaekang Kim</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyaekang Kim, Woori Kwak, Sook Hee Yoon, Dae-Kyung Kang, Heebal Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Distraction osteogenesis is an effective method for generating large amounts of bone &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; for treating pathologies such as large bone defects or skeletal malformations, for instance leg-length discrepancies. While an optimized distraction procedure might have the potential to reduce the rate of complications significantly, our knowledge of the underlying mechanobiological processes is still insufficient for systematic optimization of treatment parameters such as distraction rate or fixation stiffness. We present a novel numerical model of lateral distraction osteogenesis, based on a mechanically well-controlled &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiment. This model extends an existing numerical model of callus healing with viscoplastic material properties for describing stress relaxation and stimuli history-dependent tissue differentiation, incorporating delay and memory effects. A reformulation of appositional growth based non-local biological stimuli in terms of spatial convolution as well as remeshing and solution-mapping procedures allow the model to cope with severe mesh distortions associated with large plastic deformations. With these enhancements, our model is capable of replicating the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; observations for lateral distraction osteogenesis in sheep using the same differentiation rules and the same set of parameters that successfully describes callus healing in sheep, indicating that tissue differentiation hypotheses originally developed for fracture healing scenarios might indeed be applicable to distraction as well. The response of the model to modified distraction parameters corresponds to existing studies, although the currently available data is insufficient for rigorous validation. As such, this study provides a first step towards developing models that can serve as tools for identifying both interesting research questions and, eventually, even optimizing clinical procedures once better data for calibration and validation becomes available.</content></content><author><name>Frank Niemeyer</name></author><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Frank Niemeyer, Lutz Claes, Anita Ignatius, Nicholaus Meyers, Ulrich Simon&lt;/p&gt;

Given a selection of older papers from the journal that readers were unfamiliar with, could they pick out the ones that ended up getting cited more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this work, revised and expanded, is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194903&quot;&gt;subject of a paper&lt;/a&gt; in PLOS ONE (open access, by definition), and the author line features some blog pseudonyms, interestingly. A 2003 issue of JACS was selected, and respondents were asked the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers in the issue to you think are the most ‘significant’ (your own definition of ‘significant’ is what is important here)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without looking up numbers, which three papers do you think will have been cited the most to-date?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you most want to point out to other chemists?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you want to shout about from the rooftops (i.e., tell anybody about, not just chemists)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad to say that I seem to have skewed the set of responders a bit, since it appears that many of the people who answered the survey were readers of this blog following a link. Looking over the papers that were suggested, it seems that the correlation between the first set and the third (significant, and should be shared with other chemists) was pretty strong, as you might think, but that correlation between “significant” and “will have been cited the most” was somewhat weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the correlation between what respondents thought would be the most cited articles and the actual ten-years-later citation counts was quite poor (see the paper’s Figure 1). Looking at Figure 2, you can see that none of the other questions, in fact, correlate well with the real citation counts (I would be rather unhappy if these graphs represented project assay correlations!) Of course, it’s also true that the respondents disagreed pretty significantly about which papers were significant in the first place. That’s strong evidence that the survey set was indeed composed of practicing chemists, because we rarely agree on much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there indeed differences between “interesting, thought-provoking” papers and ones that you feel like telling other chemists about? Or between those and the ones that pick up citations? These data, though far from comprehensive, suggest that both of these may be true (as does ones own intuition, for what that’s worth). The paper tries to correlate responses to the reported areas of specialization of the responders, and there may well be something to that. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja034820y&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was cited 325 times over the next ten years, but only five responders to the survey picked it as one that would get cited. All five of them, though, indicated that they specialized in this general area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja0345423&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was selected by many survey responders as one that would pick up citations, but its actual ten-year citation count was average-to-modest. My own guess here (I may have picked this one myself!) was that the title sounded like something “hot”, by current standards, and it surely would have been picked up on. But that shows you the peril of such gut feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this does is drive yet another nail into the idea that current publication-based measures to evaluate research importance, quality, and impact are much good at all. They aren’t. The paper finishes up on just this point, referencing several other initiatives that are trying to overturn citation counts, h-indices, journal impact factors and so on. These things are measures, sure enough, but they’re not necessarily measuring very much, and not necessarily what some of their users think that they’re measuring!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><crawled>1522420818416</crawled><description>Back in 2013, I mentioned the “JACS Challenge”, an interesting attempt to see if papers that eventually got cited a lot were obvious prima facie.

To address the critical problem of the absence of validated marker genes for many (including novel) subpopulations, we developed convex analysis of mixtures (CAM), a fully unsupervised deconvolution method, for identifying marker genes and subpopulations directly from original mixed molecular expressions.</description></item><item><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25185?af=R</link><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162653f9d8b:6cdf9:76251cdd</id><unread>False</unread><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25185?af=R</originId><published>1522117090699</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e2b41ced</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25185?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1522117090699</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Weak polyelectrolyte complexation driven by associative charging</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017941?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1625704c351:4c87b6d:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017941?af=R</originId><published>1521083790000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>aa615146</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017941?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/11&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 11&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>Vikramjit S.

Estimation of visibility bias is critical to accurately compute abundance of wild populations. The franciscana, &lt;i&gt;Pontoporia blainvillei&lt;/i&gt;, is considered the most threatened small cetacean in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Aerial surveys are considered the most effective method to estimate abundance of this species, but many existing estimates have been considered unreliable because they lack proper estimation of correction factors for visibility bias. In this study, helicopter surveys were conducted to determine surfacing-diving intervals of franciscanas and to estimate availability for aerial platforms. Fifteen hours were flown and 101 groups of 1 to 7 franciscanas were monitored, resulting in a sample of 248 surface-dive cycles. The mean surfacing interval and diving interval times were 16.10 seconds (SE = 9.74) and 39.77 seconds (SE = 29.06), respectively. Availability was estimated at 0.39 (SE = 0.01), a value 16–46% greater than estimates computed from diving parameters obtained from boats or from land. Generalized mixed-effects models were used to investigate the influence of biological and environmental predictors on the proportion of time franciscana groups are visually available to be seen from an aerial platform. These models revealed that group size was the main factor influencing the proportion at surface. The use of negatively biased estimates of availability results in overestimation of abundance, leads to overly optimistic assessments of extinction probabilities and to potentially ineffective management actions. This study demonstrates that estimates of availability must be computed from suitable platforms to ensure proper conservation decisions are implemented to protect threatened species such as the franciscana.</content></content><author><name>Federico Sucunza</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Sucunza, Daniel Danilewicz, Marta Cremer, Artur Andriolo, Alexandre N.

Noninvasive detection of both early pancreatic neoplasia and metastases could enhance strategies to improve patient survival in this disease that is notorious for an extremely poor prognosis. There are almost no identifiable targets for non-invasive diagnosis by positron emission tomography (PET) for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Over-expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is found on the cell surface of both pre-neoplastic lesions and invasive PDAC. Here, a RAGE-specific single chain (scFv) was developed, specific for PET imaging in syngeneic mouse models of PDAC. An anti-RAGE scFv conjugated with a sulfo-Cy5 fluorescence molecule showed high affinity and selectivity for RAGE expressing pancreatic tumor cells and genetically engineered KRAS&lt;sup&gt;G12D&lt;/sup&gt; mouse models of PDAC. An &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; biodistribution study was performed with the &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-radiolabled scFv in a syngeneic murine pancreatic cancer model, demonstrating both the feasibility and potential of an anti-RAGE scFv for detection of PDAC.

Until recently, it was only possible to sequence DNA into short strings called &apos;reads&apos;. Nanopore is a new sequencing technology to produce significantly longer reads.

As technology becomes increasingly integrated with education, research on the relationships between students’ computing-related emotions and motivation following technological difficulties is critical to improving learning experiences. Following from Weiner’s (2010) attribution theory of achievement motivation, the present research examined relationships between causal attributions and emotions concerning academic computing difficulties in two studies. Study samples consisted of North American university students enrolled in both traditional and online universities (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 559) who responded to either hypothetical scenarios or experimental manipulations involving technological challenges experienced in academic settings. Findings from Study 1 showed stable and external attributions to be emotionally maladaptive (more helplessness, boredom, guilt), particularly in response to unexpected computing problems. Additionally, Study 2 found stable attributions for unexpected problems to predict more anxiety for traditional students, with both external and personally controllable attributions for minor problems proving emotionally beneficial for students in online degree programs (more hope, less anxiety). Overall, hypothesized negative effects of stable attributions were observed across both studies, with mixed results for personally controllable attributions and unanticipated emotional benefits of external attributions for academic computing problems warranting further study.</content></content><author><name>Rebecca Maymon</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca Maymon, Nathan C.

Studies conducted during the past few years have confirmed active West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in Serbia. Based on these studies and the epidemiological situation, the Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection launched national WNV surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015. The programmes encompassed the territory of Serbia and were conducted by the veterinary service in collaboration with entomologists and ornithologists. The objective of the programmes was early detection of WNV and timely reporting to the public health service and local authorities to increase both clinical and mosquito control preparedness. The WNV surveillance programmes were based on direct and indirect surveillance of the presence of WNV by the serological testing of initially seronegative sentinel horses and chickens as well as through viral detection in pooled mosquito and wild bird samples. The most intense WNV circulation was observed in all seven districts of Vojvodina Province (northern Serbia) and Belgrade City, where most of the positive samples were detected among sentinel animals, mosquitoes and wild birds. The West Nile virus surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015 showed satisfactory results in their capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for humans and their sensitivity to early detect viral circulation at the enzootic level. Most of the human cases were preceded by the detection of WNV circulation as part of the surveillance programmes. According to the existing data, it can be reasonably assumed that WNV infection, now an endemic infection in Serbia, will continue to present a significant problem for the veterinary service and public health.</content></content><author><name>Tamaš Petrović</name></author><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tamaš Petrović, Milanko Šekler, Dušan Petrić, Sava Lazić, Zoran Debeljak, Dejan Vidanović, Aleksandra Ignjatović Ćupina, Gospava Lazić, Diana Lupulović, Mišo Kolarević, Budimir Plavšić&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria are able to grow in a planktonic state that is associated with acute infections and in biofilms that are associated with chronic infections. Acute infections, such as skin infections, are often self-limiting. However, chronic infections, such as implant infections, can be difficult to clear and may require surgical intervention. The host immune response may contribute to the different outcomes often associated with these two disease types. We used proteomic arrays and two murine models for an initial, descriptive characterization of the contribution of the host immune response to outcomes of acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; disease. We compared the immune responses between a model of self-limiting skin and soft tissue infection caused by the planktonic form of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; versus a model of surgical mesh implant infection, which we show to be caused by a bacterial biofilm. The significantly altered host cytokines and chemokines were largely different in the two models, with responses diminished by 21 days post-implantation in surgical mesh infection. Because bacterial levels remained constant during the 21 days that the surgical mesh infection was followed, those cytokines that are significantly increased during chronic infection are not likely effective in eradicating biofilm. Comparison of the levels of cytokines and chemokines in acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; infection can provide a starting point for evaluation of the role of specific immune factors that are present in one disease manifestation but not the other.</content></content><author><name>Rebecca A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Many mathematical models have investigated the population-level impact of expanding antiretroviral therapy (ART), using different assumptions about HIV disease progression on ART and among ART dropouts.

The model was independently calibrated to HIV prevalence and ART coverage data from the United States under each progression assumption in turn. New HIV infections and HIV-related deaths averted over 10 years were compared for fixed ART coverage increases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Little absolute difference (&amp;lt;7 percentage points (pp)) in HIV infections averted over 10 years was seen between progression assumptions for the same increases in ART coverage (varied between 33% and 90%) if ART dropouts reinitiated ART at the same rate as ART-naïve MSM. Larger differences in the predicted fraction of HIV-related deaths averted were observed (up to 15pp). However, if ART dropouts could only reinitiate ART at CD4&amp;lt;200 cells/μl, assumption C predicted substantially larger fractions of HIV infections and deaths averted than other assumptions (up to 20pp and 37pp larger, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Different disease progression assumptions on and post-ART interruption did not affect the fraction of HIV infections averted with expanded ART, unless ART dropouts only re-initiated ART at low CD4 counts.

Different disease progression assumptions had a larger influence on the fraction of HIV-related deaths averted with expanded ART.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005978</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>1</engagement><title>In silico study of multicellular automaticity of heterogeneous cardiac cell monolayers: Effects of automaticity strength and structural linear anisotropy</title><recrawled>1520886066014</recrawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005978</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1621b5d195f:ddb4c:a077e55f</id><updated>1520888400000</updated><unread>False</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005978</originId><published>1520888400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ea8fd475</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/LN7ks_yuF74/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by James Elber Duverger, Vincent Jacquemet, Alain Vinet, Philippe Comtois&lt;/p&gt;
The biological pacemaker approach is an alternative to cardiac electronic pacemakers. Its main objective is to create pacemaking activity from added or modified distribution of spontaneous cells in the myocardium. This paper aims to assess how automaticity strength of pacemaker cells (i.e. their ability to maintain robust spontaneous activity with fast rate and to drive neighboring quiescent cells) and structural linear anisotropy, combined with density and spatial distribution of pacemaker cells, may affect the macroscopic behavior of the biological pacemaker. A stochastic algorithm was used to randomly distribute pacemaker cells, with various densities and spatial distributions, in a semi-continuous mathematical model. Simulations of the model showed that stronger automaticity allows onset of spontaneous activity for lower densities and more homogeneous spatial distributions, displayed more central foci, less variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for similar spatial patterns, but more variability in those same variables for dissimilar spatial patterns. Compared their isotropic counterparts, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; anisotropic monolayers had less central foci and displayed more variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for both similar and dissimilar spatial patterns. The present study established a link between microscopic structure and macroscopic behavior of the biological pacemaker, and may provide crucial information for optimized biological pacemaker therapies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LN7ks_yuF74&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>James Elber Duverger</name></author><crawled>1520877508959</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by James Elber Duverger, Vincent Jacquemet, Alain Vinet, Philippe Comtois&lt;/p&gt;

To ensure online collaborative learning meets the intended pedagogical goals (is actually collaborative and stimulates learning), mechanisms are needed for monitoring the efficiency of online collaboration. Various studies have indicated that social network analysis can be particularly effective in studying students’ interactions in online collaboration. However, research in education has only focused on the theoretical potential of using SNA, not on the actual benefits they achieved. This study investigated how social network analysis can be used to monitor online collaborative learning, find aspects in need of improvement, guide an informed intervention, and assess the efficacy of intervention using an experimental, observational repeated-measurement design in three courses over a full-term duration. Using a combination of SNA-based visual and quantitative analysis, we monitored three SNA constructs for each participant: the level of interactivity, the role, and position in information exchange, and the role played by each participant in the collaboration. On the group level, we monitored interactivity and group cohesion indicators. Our monitoring uncovered a non-collaborative teacher-centered pattern of interactions in the three studied courses as well as very few interactions among students, limited information exchange or negotiation, and very limited student networks dominated by the teacher. An intervention based on SNA-generated insights was designed. The intervention was structured into five actions: increasing awareness, promoting collaboration, improving the content, preparing teachers, and finally practicing with feedback. Evaluation of the intervention revealed that it has significantly enhanced student-student interactions and teacher-student interactions, as well as produced a collaborative pattern of interactions among most students and teachers. Since efficient and communicative activities are essential prerequisites for successful content discussion and for realizing the goals of collaboration, we suggest that our SNA-based approach will positively affect teaching and learning in many educational domains. Our study offers a proof-of-concept of what SNA can add to the current tools for monitoring and supporting teaching and learning in higher education.</content></content><author><name>Mohammed Saqr</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammed Saqr, Uno Fors, Matti Tedre, Jalal Nouri&lt;/p&gt;

Our study offers a proof-of-concept of what SNA can add to the current tools for monitoring and supporting teaching and learning in higher education.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01306</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Surprising Sequence Effects on GU Closure of Symmetric 2 × 2 Nucleotide RNA Internal Loops</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01306</link><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_16254a13af5:526d3:a077e55f</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.7b01306/20180323/images/medium/bi-2017-01306y_0007.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>260</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01306</originId><crawled>1521838275317</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d40a3b46</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.7b01306/20180323/images/medium/bi-2017-01306y_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01306&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Fungal spores and mycelium fragments are particles which become and remain airborne and have been subjects of aerobiological studies. The presence and the abundance of taxa in aerobiological samples can be very variable and impaired by changeable climatic conditions. Because many fungi produce mycotoxins and both their mycelium fragments and spores are potential allergens, monitoring the presence of these taxa is of key importance. So far data on exposure and sensitization to fungal allergens are mainly based on the assessment of few, easily identifiable taxa and focused only on certain environments. The microscopic method used to analyze aerobiological samples and the inconspicuous fungal characters do not allow a in depth taxonomical identification. Here, we present a first assessment of fungal diversity from airborne samples using a DNA metabarcoding analysis. The nuclear ITS2 region was selected as barcode to catch fungal diversity in mixed airborne samples gathered during two weeks in four sites of North-Eastern and Central Italy. We assessed the taxonomic composition and diversity within and among the sampled sites and compared the molecular data with those obtained by traditional microscopy. The molecular analyses provide a tenfold more comprehensive determination of the taxa than the traditional morphological inspections. Our results prove that the metabarcoding analysis is a promising approach to increases quality and sensitivity of the aerobiological monitoring. The laboratory and bioinformatic workflow implemented here is now suitable for routine, high-throughput, regional analyses of airborne fungi.</content></content><author><name>Elisa Banchi</name></author><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elisa Banchi, Claudio Gennaro Ametrano, David Stanković, Pierluigi Verardo, Olga Moretti, Francesca Gabrielli, Stefania Lazzarin, Maria Francesca Borney, Francesca Tassan, Mauro Tretiach, Alberto Pallavicini, Lucia Muggia&lt;/p&gt;

The laboratory and bioinformatic workflow implemented here is now suitable for routine, high-throughput, regional analyses of airborne fungi.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Combined use of protein biomarkers and network analysis unveils deregulated regulatory circuits in Duchenne muscular dystrophy</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194225</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1621b5bd7fb:64d10c4:7c9981b6</id><updated>1520888400000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194225</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194225</originId><published>1520888400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f1eb5aac</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194225</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Silvia Parolo, Luca Marchetti, Mario Lauria, Karla Misselbeck, Marie-Pier Scott-Boyer, Laura Caberlotto, Corrado Priami&lt;/p&gt;
Although the genetic basis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy has been known for almost thirty years, the cellular and molecular mechanisms characterizing the disease are not completely understood and an efficacious treatment remains to be developed. In this study we analyzed proteomics data obtained with the SomaLogic technology from blood serum of a cohort of patients and matched healthy subjects. We developed a workflow based on biomarker identification and network-based pathway analysis that allowed us to describe different deregulated pathways. In addition to muscle-related functions, we identified other biological processes such as apoptosis, signaling in the immune system and neurotrophin signaling as significantly modulated in patients compared with controls. Moreover, our network-based analysis identified the involvement of FoxO transcription factors as putative regulators of different pathways. On the whole, this study provided a global view of the molecular processes involved in Duchenne muscular dystrophy that are decipherable from serum proteome.</content></content><author><name>Silvia Parolo</name></author><crawled>1520877426683</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Silvia Parolo, Luca Marchetti, Mario Lauria, Karla Misselbeck, Marie-Pier Scott-Boyer, Laura Caberlotto, Corrado Priami&lt;/p&gt;

In the physiochemical sciences, plasma is used to describe an ionized gas. Previous studies have implicated plasma surface treatment in the enhancement of hydrophilicity of implanted musculoskeletal reconstructive materials. Hydroxyapatite (HA) ceramics, widely used in bone tissue regeneration, have made great advancements to skeletal surgery. In the present study, we investigate the impact of low-pressure plasma on the interconnected porous calcium hydroxyapatite (IP-CHA) both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Our results indicate that dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma, when used with oxygen, can augment the hydrophilicity of non-porous HA surfaces and the osteoconductivity of the IP-CHA disc via increased water penetration of inner porous structures, as demonstrated through microfocus computed tomography (μCT) assay. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; implantation of plasma-treated IP-CHA displayed superior bone ingrowth than untreated IP-CHA. Though plasma-treated IP-CHA did not alter osteoblast cell proliferation, it accelerated osteogenic differentiation of seeded marrow mesenchymal stem cells. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that this plasma treatment increases levels of oxygen, rather than nitrogen, on the plasma-treated IP-CHA surface. These findings suggest that plasma treatment, an easy and simple processing, can significantly improve the osteoconductive potential of commonly used artificial bones such as IP-CHA. Further optimization of plasma treatment and longer-term follow-up of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; application are required toward its clinical application.</content></content><author><name>Yu Moriguchi</name></author><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Moriguchi, Dae-Sung Lee, Ryota Chijimatsu, Khair Thamina, Kazuto Masuda, Dai Itsuki, Hideki Yoshikawa, Satoshi Hamaguchi, Akira Myoui&lt;/p&gt;

Antimicrobials are used in animal agriculture to cure bacterial infectious diseases. However, antimicrobial use (AMU) inevitably leads to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially infecting humans. As a global public threat, antimicrobial resistance has led policy makers to implement regulations supervising AMU. The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production.</content></content><author><name>Guillaume Lhermie</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Lhermie, Loren William Tauer, Yrjo Tapio Gröhn&lt;/p&gt;

Being generally regarded as commensal bacteria, the pro-inflammatory capacity of &lt;i&gt;Ureaplasma&lt;/i&gt; species has long been debated. Recently, we confirmed &lt;i&gt;Ureaplasma&lt;/i&gt;–driven pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and a disturbance of cytokine equilibrium in primary human monocytes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The present study addressed the expression of CC chemokines and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in purified term neonatal and adult monocytes stimulated with serovar 8 of &lt;i&gt;Ureaplasma urealyticum&lt;/i&gt; (Uu) and serovar 3 of &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parvum&lt;/i&gt; (Up). Using qRT-PCR and multi-analyte immunoassay, we assessed mRNA and protein expression of the monocyte chemotactic proteins 1 and 3 (MCP-1/3), the macrophage inflammatory proteins 1α and 1β (MIP-1α/β) as well as MMP-9. For the most part, both isolates stimulated mRNA expression of all given chemokines and MMP-9 in cord blood and adult monocytes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). These results were paralleled by Uu and Up-induced secretion of MCP-1 protein in both cells (neonatal: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01, adult: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). Release of MCP-3, MIP-1α, MIP-1β and MMP-9 was enhanced upon exposure to Up (neonatal: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, respectively; adult: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Co-stimulation of LPS-primed monocytes with Up increased LPS-induced MCP-1 release in neonatal cells (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) and aggravated LPS-induced MMP-9 mRNA in both cell subsets (neonatal: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05, adult: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).

Traditionally, a different tool is used for each operation, such as quality control, adapter trimming, and quality filtering. These tools are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using high level programming languages (e.g., Python and Java) and provide limited multithreading support. Reading and loading data multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O inefficient. Results: We developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per read quality cutting, and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. It also supports unique molecular identifier preprocessing, poly tail trimming, output splitting, and base correction for paired-end data. It can automatically detect adapters for single-end and paired-end FASTQ data. This tool is developed in C++ and has multithreading support. Based on our evaluation, fastp is 2 to 5 times faster than other FASTQ preprocessing tools such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt despite performing far more operations than similar tools.

These tools are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using high level programming languages (e.g., Python and Java) and provide limited multithreading support. Reading and loading data multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O inefficient. Results: We developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per read quality cutting, and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. It also supports unique molecular identifier preprocessing, poly tail trimming, output splitting, and base correction for paired-end data. It can automatically detect adapters for single-end and paired-end FASTQ data. This tool is developed in C++ and has multithreading support. Based on our evaluation, fastp is 2 to 5 times faster than other FASTQ preprocessing tools such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt despite performing far more operations than similar tools.

Koalas (&lt;i&gt;Phascolarctos cinereus&lt;/i&gt;) are iconic Australian marsupials currently threatened by several processes, including infectious diseases and ecological disruption. Infection with &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia pecorum&lt;/i&gt;, is considered a key driver of population decline. The clinical sign of ‘wet bottom’, a staining of the rump associated with urinary incontinence, is often caused by chlamydial urinary tract infections. However, wet bottom has been recorded in koalas free of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting other causative agents in those individuals. We used 16S rRNA diversity profiling to investigate the microbiome of the urogenital tract of ten female koalas in order to identify potential causative agents of wet bottom, other than &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt;. Five urogenital samples were processed from koalas presenting with wet bottom and five were clinically normal. All koalas were negative for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; infection. We detected thirteen phyla across the ten samples, with &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; occurring at the highest relative abundance (77.6%). The order &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillales&lt;/i&gt;, within the &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, comprised 70.3% of the reads from all samples. After normalising reads using DESeq2 and testing for significant differences (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), there were 25 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) more commonly found in one group over the other. The families &lt;i&gt;Aerococcaceae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tissierellaceae&lt;/i&gt; both had four significantly differentially abundant OTUs. These four &lt;i&gt;Tissierellaceae&lt;/i&gt; OTUs were all significantly more abundant in koalas with wet bottom. This study provides the foundation for future investigations of causes of koala wet bottom, other than &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; infection. This is of clinical relevance as wet bottom is often assumed to be caused by &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; and treated accordingly. Our research highlights that other organisms may be causing wet bottom, and these potential aetiological agents need to be further investigated to fully address the problems this species faces.</content></content><author><name>Alistair R.

These four &lt;i&gt;Tissierellaceae&lt;/i&gt; OTUs were all significantly more abundant in koalas with wet bottom. This study provides the foundation for future investigations of causes of koala wet bottom, other than &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; infection. This is of clinical relevance as wet bottom is often assumed to be caused by &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; and treated accordingly. Our research highlights that other organisms may be causing wet bottom, and these potential aetiological agents need to be further investigated to fully address the problems this species faces.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Anomalous van der Waals-Casimir interactions on graphene: A concerted effect of temperature, retardation, and non-locality</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023170?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b62:7c9981b6</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023170?af=R</originId><published>1522907148000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ebf03306</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023170?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>Alberto Ambrosetti</name></author><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03598-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Experimentally quantifying anion polarizability at the air/water interface</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03598-x</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1628ac0c06b:91f5e98:34f43e70</id><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03598-x</originId><published>1522738800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e5f9563</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/NlhoP4yU9Nw/s41467-018-03598-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experimentally quantifying anion polarizability at the air/water interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimentally quantifying anion polarizability at the air/water interface, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03598-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03598-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Understanding anion-specific interactions with hydrophobic interfaces is challenging due to an absence of local structural probes.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple marker of inflammation, has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation. However, whether it can be used to predict HCC development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative NLR for the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy. A total of 230 HBV-associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2012 were included in this study. Detailed clinical data included patients’ general characteristics, laboratory tests and imaging studies, surgical procedures and complications. Information on patients’ follow-up data was also obtained. We found that 38 (16.52%) patients developed HCC after splenectomy during the follow-up period. An elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of developing HCC in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for HCC development was 2.27. In patients who developed HCC during the follow-up period, NLR scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy. However, NLR scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop HCC. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</content></content><author><name>Zhaoqing Du</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqing Du, Jian Dong, Jianbin Bi, Ruhai Bai, Jia Zhang, Zheng Wu, Yi Lv, Xufeng Zhang, Rongqian Wu&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoleamine_2,3-dioxygenase&quot;&gt;IDO&lt;/a&gt; inhibitors before, partly in the context of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/10/16/incyte-and-flexus-the-grappling-continues&quot;&gt;odd situation&lt;/a&gt; between Incyte and Flexus, and partly in response to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/06/08/why-did-this-ido-inhibitor-trial-fail&quot;&gt;failed trial&lt;/a&gt; of a compound from NewLink. That last one shook people up a bit, but (as I mentioned in the post) there was still hope for combination of the Incyte drug with Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The idea is that IDO inhibition would increase T-cell activity and add to Keytruda’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that is not the case. The companies have announced that the Phase III trial of this combination in melanoma has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/body-blow-for-incyte-as-merck-partnered-melanoma-trial-bombs&quot;&gt;utterly missed&lt;/a&gt; its endpoints, and that appears to be a massive setback for the whole idea. Add that to the earlier difficulties with other IDO compounds, and the picture is Not Good. Bristol-Myers Squibb has &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bms.com/press-release/bristolmyers/encouraging-response-observed-opdivo-nivolumab-plus-investigational-ido1-&quot;&gt;a big trial going&lt;/a&gt; with their own Opdivo (nivolumab) and their own IDO1 inhibitor (BMS-986205) in melanoma, and this bodes very ill for those results indeed. It has to be noted that they’ve announced what appear to be positive results for that combination&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bms.com/press-release/bristolmyers/encouraging-response-observed-opdivo-nivolumab-plus-investigational-ido1-&quot;&gt; in other trials&lt;/a&gt;, but hey: Merck and Incyte had what appeared to be decent-looking results early on, too. The feeling when this trial was announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biospace.com/article/confident-bristol-myers-to-launch-a-700-patient-phase-iii-ido-trial-for-melanoma/&quot;&gt;was that&lt;/a&gt; since the company was not waiting for the Merck readout that they must have been pretty confident. But that could also reflect the company’s feeling – not unjustified at all – that they’re locked in a brutal struggle with Merck in this area and had no time to sit around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only bad news for melanoma patients, for Merck, and (especially) for Incyte. And it’s not only potentially bad news for BMS. It’s potentially bad news for everyone who thought that their understanding of these pathways was good enough to predict success for this trial. One of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/next-generation-cancer-drugs-boost-immunotherapy-responses-1.22092&quot;&gt;biggest things going&lt;/a&gt; in immuno-oncology is the combination of the existing agents (PD pathway drugs) with other mechanisms to potentiate their effects and move them into new areas. This trial shows that we don’t know as much about how to do that as we thought we did. So although the IDO-based trials are now very uncertain, this news throws uncertainty around the entire field, whether it goes through that mechanism or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all eyes are on Bristol-Myers Squibb: will their current trial run to completion? I don’t know when they have any interim data reads coming up, but that’s going to be fraught with interest. The expectation at this point is that the trial will fail, for the same reasons – whatever those are – that the Merck/Incyte one just did. But there’s an outside chance that our ignorance of the field is even more profound and that it’ll actually work. &lt;em&gt;(Update: I should emphasize that the binding mode of the BMS compounds is in fact different from the earlier ones – will this make a difference?)&lt;/em&gt; Wouldn’t that be a twist? But you’d have to be brave to bet that way. . .we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><crawled>1523282245917</crawled><description>Friday brought some very unwelcome news in oncology.
