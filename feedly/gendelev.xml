The hemodynamic effects of intravenous (IV) paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are unknown. We performed a prospective single center placebo controlled randomized study with parallel group design in adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Participants received paracetamol (1 gram) IV or placebo (an equal volume of 0.9% saline) preoperatively followed by two postoperative doses 6 hours apart. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in systolic (SBP) 30 minutes after the preoperative infusion, analysed using an ANCOVA model. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic blood pressure (DPB), and other key hemodynamic variables after each infusion. All other endpoints were analysed using random-effect generalized least squares regression modelling with individual patients treated as random effects. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to receive paracetamol (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). Post preoperative infusion, paracetamol decreased SBP by a mean (SD) of 13 (18) mmHg, p = 0.02, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (11) mmHg with saline. Paracetamol decreased MAP and DBP by a mean (SD) of 9 (12) mmHg and 8 (9) mmHg (p = 0.01 and 0.02), respectively, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (8) mmHg and 0 (6) mmHg with placebo. Postoperatively, there were no significant differences in pressure or flow based hemodynamic parameters in both groups. This study provides high quality evidence that the administration of IV paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery causes a transient decrease in preoperative blood pressure when administered before surgery but no adverse hemodynamic effects when administered in the postoperative setting.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523912400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195931</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195931</link><unread>True</unread><title>The hemodynamic effects of intravenous paracetamol (acetaminophen) vs normal saline in cardiac surgery patients: A single center placebo controlled randomized study</title><updated>1523912400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195931</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aec:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195931</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth Chiam, Rinaldo Bellomo, Leonid Churilov, Laurence Weinberg&lt;/p&gt;

The FRH (frequency-interacting RNA helicase) protein is the &lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&lt;/i&gt; homolog of yeast Mtr4, an essential RNA helicase that plays a central role in RNA metabolism as an activator of the nuclear RNA exosome. FRH is also a required component of the circadian clock, mediating protein interactions that result in the rhythmic repression of gene expression. Here we show that FRH unwinds RNA substrates &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with a kinetic profile similar to Mtr4, indicating that while FRH has acquired additional functionality, its core helicase function remains intact. In contrast with the earlier FRH structures, a new crystal form of FRH results in an ATP binding site that is undisturbed by crystal contacts and adopts a conformation consistent with nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Strikingly, this new FRH structure adopts an arch domain conformation that is dramatically altered from previous structures. Comparison of the existing FRH structures reveals conserved hinge points that appear to facilitate arch motion. Regions in the arch have been previously shown to mediate a variety of protein-protein interactions critical for RNA surveillance and circadian clock functions. The conformational changes highlighted in the FRH structures provide a platform for investigating the relationship between arch dynamics and Mtr4/FRH function.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196642</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196642</link><unread>True</unread><title>Structure of frequency-interacting RNA helicase from &amp;lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&amp;lt;/i&gt; reveals high flexibility in a domain critical for circadian rhythm and RNA surveillance</title><updated>1525294800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196642</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a182:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196642</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yalemi Morales, Keith J.

In combat sports such as taekwondo (TKD), athletes rapidly reduce body weight to achieve a desired weight category. Competition takes place 16–24 h after weigh-in and thus, the recovery time is an important factor for competition performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of rapid weight reduction (RWR) on athletic performance and associated hemorheological properties considering relevant recovery time. Five male TKD athletes reduced body weight by 5% within 3½ days. A simulated competition day (SCD) was carried out after a 16 h recovery period. Parameters were measured before RWR, at weigh-in and before and after three TKD simulation matches (SMs) at SCD. Same set-up was conducted but without RWR as control. Basal blood parameters, red blood cells (RBC) deformability and aggregation, serum glucose and fibrinogen were determined. During SMs, heart rate (HR&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;, HR&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt;), oxygen uptake (VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;, VO&lt;sub&gt;2mean&lt;/sub&gt;), peak lactate (Peak La&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), difference of lactate (ΔLa) and energy systems (anaerobic-alactic, -lactic and aerobic) were analyzed. Basal blood parameters remained unaltered during the interventions. RBC deformability was reduced and aggregation was increased after RWR but values returned to baseline after recovery and were not affected by the SMs. Glucose level was not affected by the interventions. Kick frequency in SMs was higher after RWR which might be responsible for higher HR&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;, VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;, VO&lt;sub&gt;2mean&lt;/sub&gt;, Peak La&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, ΔLa&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and aerobic demand. The 16 h recovery is sufficient to regenerate measured physiological and hemorheological parameters. TKD-specific performance was not negatively affected during SMs after RWR.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524776400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196568</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196568</link><unread>True</unread><title>Rapid weight reduction does not impair athletic performance of Taekwondo athletes – A pilot study</title><updated>1524776400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196568</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7c:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196568</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Woo-Hwi Yang, Oliver Heine, Marijke Grau&lt;/p&gt;
In combat sports such as taekwondo (TKD), athletes rapidly reduce body weight to achieve a desired weight category. Competition takes place 16–24 h after weigh-in and thus, the recovery time is an important factor for competition performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of rapid weight reduction (RWR) on athletic performance and associated hemorheological properties considering relevant recovery time. Five male TKD athletes reduced body weight by 5% within 3½ days. A simulated competition day (SCD) was carried out after a 16 h recovery period. Parameters were measured before RWR, at weigh-in and before and after three TKD simulation matches (SMs) at SCD. Same set-up was conducted but without RWR as control. Basal blood parameters, red blood cells (RBC) deformability and aggregation, serum glucose and fibrinogen were determined. During SMs, heart rate (HR&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;, HR&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt;), oxygen uptake (VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;, VO&lt;sub&gt;2mean&lt;/sub&gt;), peak lactate (Peak La&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), difference of lactate (ΔLa) and energy systems (anaerobic-alactic, -lactic and aerobic) were analyzed. Basal blood parameters remained unaltered during the interventions. RBC deformability was reduced and aggregation was increased after RWR but values returned to baseline after recovery and were not affected by the SMs. Glucose level was not affected by the interventions. Kick frequency in SMs was higher after RWR which might be responsible for higher HR&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;, VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;, VO&lt;sub&gt;2mean&lt;/sub&gt;, Peak La&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, ΔLa&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and aerobic demand. The 16 h recovery is sufficient to regenerate measured physiological and hemorheological parameters. TKD-specific performance was not negatively affected during SMs after RWR.</description><fingerprint>e48b1ead</fingerprint><author><name>Woo-Hwi Yang</name></author><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xue Guo, Hu Zhang, Tianhai Tian&lt;/p&gt;
Stock correlation networks use stock price data to explore the relationship between different stocks listed in the stock market. Currently this relationship is dominantly measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. However, financial data suggest that nonlinear relationships may exist in the stock prices of different shares. To address this issue, this work uses mutual information to characterize the nonlinear relationship between stocks. Using 280 stocks traded at the Shanghai Stocks Exchange in China during the period of 2014-2016, we first compare the effectiveness of the correlation coefficient and mutual information for measuring stock relationships. Based on these two measures, we then develop two stock networks using the Minimum Spanning Tree method and study the topological properties of these networks, including degree, path length and the power-law distribution. The relationship network based on mutual information has a better distribution of the degree and larger value of the power-law distribution than those using the correlation coefficient. Numerical results show that mutual information is a more effective approach than the correlation coefficient to measure the stock relationship in a stock market that may undergo large fluctuations of stock prices.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524085200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195941</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195941</link><unread>True</unread><title>Development of stock correlation networks using mutual information and financial big data</title><updated>1524085200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195941</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccbc:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195941</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xue Guo, Hu Zhang, Tianhai Tian&lt;/p&gt;

This paper reports on a social discounting experiment conducted with university students in South Africa. In line with other social discounting task experiments, participants identify target individuals at different degrees of intimacy in their social network and then make 10 choices involving sums of money for themselves or their targets. For an altruism premium to exist, senders’ donations to recipients should be positive, statistically and economically significant, and independent of relationship closeness. We hypothesize that in addition to the altruism premium for kin documented in the literature, there may be other premia for family in general and for partners and friends. We find that, apart from the “kinship” premium, there is a sizeable “intimacy” premium, which together translates into a substantial “family” premium. The study also finds a “friendship premium”, as is documented in various experiments. The closeness of relationships among family and kin, especially close kin, has a significant and large effect on altruism. The results also attest to the importance of the extended family in regards to the “kinship” premium on altruism. These various premiums on altruism emphasise the importance of the supportive role of various social systems. Nevertheless, altruism within families and among close kin might also be enhanced by building more cohesive and stronger families using developmental social welfare programmes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523998800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196175</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196175</link><unread>True</unread><title>Putting a premium on altruism: A social discounting experiment with South African university students</title><updated>1523998800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196175</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:334416b:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196175</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Frederik Booysen, Sevias Guvuriro, Alistair Munro, Tshepo Moloi, Celeste Campher&lt;/p&gt;

Treatment of prosthetic joint infections often involves multiple surgeries and prolonged antibiotic administration, resulting in a significant burden to patients and the healthcare system. We are exploring a non-invasive method to eradicate biofilm on metal implants utilizing high-frequency alternating magnetic fields (AMF) which can achieve surface induction heating. Although proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the ability of AMF to eradicate biofilm in vitro, there is a legitimate safety concern related to the potential for thermal damage to surrounding tissues when considering heating implanted metal objects. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting acoustic emissions associated with boiling at the interface between a metal implant and surrounding soft tissue as a wireless safety sensing mechanism. Acoustic emissions generated during in vitro and in vivo AMF exposures were captured with a hydrophone, and the relationship with surface temperature analyzed. The effect of AMF exposure power, surrounding media composition, implant location within the AMF transmitter, and implant geometry on acoustic detection during AMF therapy was also evaluated. Acoustic emissions were reliably identified in both tissue-mimicking phantom and mouse studies, and their onset coincided with the implant temperature reaching the boiling threshold. The viscosity of the surrounding medium did not impact the production of acoustic emissions; however, emissions were not present when the medium was oil due to the higher boiling point. Results of simulations and in vivo studies suggest that short-duration, high-power AMF exposures combined with acoustic sensing can be used to minimize the amount of thermal damage in surrounding tissues. These studies support the hypothesis that detection of boiling associated acoustic emissions at a metal/tissue interface could serve as a real-time, wireless safety indicator during AMF treatment of biofilm on metallic implants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197380</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197380</link><unread>True</unread><title>Remote acoustic sensing as a safety mechanism during exposure of metal implants to alternating magnetic fields</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197380</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559162:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197380</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bingbing Cheng, Yonatan Chatzinoff, Debby Szczepanski, Chenchen Bing, Sumbul Shaikh, Omar Wyman, Cameron E.

These studies support the hypothesis that detection of boiling associated acoustic emissions at a metal/tissue interface could serve as a real-time, wireless safety indicator during AMF treatment of biofilm on metallic implants.</description><fingerprint>83dec9ed</fingerprint><author><name>Bingbing Cheng</name></author><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/14&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 14&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523247316000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024010?af=R</link><unread>True</unread><title>Polymer effects on Kármán vortex: Molecular dynamics study</title><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024010?af=R</originId><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162c30cf7b9:1b852f8:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024010?af=R</href></item></alternate><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><fingerprint>146143de</fingerprint><author><name>Yuta Asano</name></author><crawled>1523690829753</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The stage of seed development influences iron bioavailability in pea (&lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&lt;/i&gt; L.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stage of seed development influences iron bioavailability in pea (&amp;lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.), Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25130-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25130-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The stage of seed development influences iron bioavailability in pea (&lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&lt;/i&gt; L.)&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/XdTwX1ESTEs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525244400000</published><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25130-3/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25130_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>526</width><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25130-3</link><unread>True</unread><title>The stage of seed development influences iron bioavailability in pea (Pisum sativum L.)</title><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25130-3</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25130-3</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163202377ae:2fe1ca:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/XdTwX1ESTEs/s41598-018-25130-3</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The stage of seed development influences iron bioavailability in pea (&lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&lt;/i&gt; L.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stage of seed development influences iron bioavailability in pea (&amp;lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.), Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25130-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25130-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The stage of seed development influences iron bioavailability in pea (&lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&lt;/i&gt; L.)&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/XdTwX1ESTEs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>47c84ee9</fingerprint><author><name>Katie L.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates genes in many physiological pathways by binding to enhancer and silencer elements of target genes, where it recruits coregulator proteins that remodel chromatin and regulate the assembly of transcription complexes. The coregulator Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is necessary for glucocorticoid (GC) regulation of one group of GR target genes, is irrelevant for a second group, and inhibits GR binding to a third gene set, thereby blocking their regulation by GC. Gene-specific characteristics that distinguish GR binding regions (GBR) at Hic-5 blocked genes from GBR at other GC-regulated genes are unknown. Here we show genome-wide that blocked GBR generally require CHD9 and BRM for GR occupancy in contrast to GBR that are not blocked by Hic-5. Hic-5 blocked GBR are enriched near Hic-5 blocked GR target genes but not near GR target genes that are not blocked by Hic-5. Furthermore blocked GBR are in a closed conformation prior to Hic-5 depletion, and require Hic-5 depletion and glucocorticoid treatment to create an open conformation necessary for GR occupancy. A transcription factor binding motif characteristic of the ETS family was enriched near blocked GBR and blocked genes but not near non-blocked GBR or non-blocked GR target genes. Thus, we identify specific differences in chromatin conformation, chromatin remodeler requirements, and local DNA sequence motifs that contribute to gene-specific actions of transcription factors and coregulators. These findings shed light on mechanisms that contribute to binding site selection by transcription factors, which vary in a cell type-specific manner.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196965</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196965</link><unread>True</unread><title>Different chromatin and DNA sequence characteristics define glucocorticoid receptor binding sites that are blocked or not blocked by coregulator Hic-5</title><updated>1525813200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196965</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47505b:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196965</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brian H.

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a zinc-dependent protease associated with early immune responses to &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection, macrophage recruitment and granuloma formation. We evaluated whether adjunctive inhibition of MMP-9 could improve the response to standard TB treatment in a mouse model that develops necrotic lesions. Six weeks after an aerosol infection with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, C3HeB/FeJ mice received standard TB treatment (12 weeks) comprising rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide alone or in combination with either anti-MMP-9 antibody, etanercept (positive control) or isotype antibody (negative control) for 6 weeks. Anti-MMP-9 and the isotype control had comparable high serum exposures and expected terminal half-life. The relapse rate in mice receiving standard TB treatment was 46.6%. Compared to the standard TB treatment, relapse rates in animals that received adjunctive treatments with anti-MMP-9 antibody or etanercept were significantly decreased to 25.9% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) and 29.8% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019) respectively, but were not different from the arm that received the isotype control antibody (25.9%). Immunostaining demonstrated localization of MMP-9 primarily in macrophages in both murine and human lung tissues infected with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting the importance of MMP-9 in TB pathogenesis. These data suggest that the relapse rates in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice may be non-specifically improved by administration of antibodies in conjunction with standard TB treatments.

The increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus is becoming a serious threat to human health in various parts of the world. Studies with dairy products have shown a potential beneficial effect against diabetes. This experiment evaluated the supplementation of milk naturally enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and polyphenols in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Forty male 28-day-old &lt;i&gt;Wistar&lt;/i&gt; rats were distributed in four experimental treatments of diabetic animals (streptozotocin induction) and a normal group (non-induced). Experimental treatments were: control (water), whole common milk (COM-M), milk enriched with PUFA (PUFA-M), milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols (PUFA/P-M) through a special diet offered to dairy cows. Milk supplementation at a dose 5 mL/kg body weight was performed for 77 days, 42 days before and 35 days after diabetes induction. The COM-M supplementation increased brown fat deposits, reduced post-induction glucose levels, reduced blood fructosamine levels, and improved glucose tolerance. Milk enriched with PUFA reduced final fasting glucose, LDL levels, and improved blood antioxidant capacity. Milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols promoted an increase in gastrocnemius muscle mass, and a reduction in mesenteric fat and LDL levels. Milk intake, with an emphasis on milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols, attenuated the metabolic disorders of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523653200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195839</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195839</link><unread>False</unread><title>Functionality of cow milk naturally enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols in diets for diabetic rats</title><updated>1523653200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195839</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793631:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195839</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emerson H.

In human sleep studies, the probability of discomfort from the electrodes and the change in environment usually results in first-night recordings being discarded. Sleep recordings from the first night in human subjects often differ in amount of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and the overall sleep architecture. This study investigated whether recordings of sleep states in dairy cows also show a first-night effect. Non-invasive electrophysiological recordings were carried out on nine cows of the Swedish Red breed during three consecutive 24-hour periods (recording days 1–3). Overall, cows spent 12.9 ± 1.4 hours awake, 8.2 ± 1 hours ruminating, 57.2 ± 20.3 min drowsing, 44.1 ± 20.2 min in REM sleep and 64.3 ± 38.1 min in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (mean ± SD) and there were no significant differences between recording days in total duration for any of the sleep and awake states. However, the bouts of REM sleep and rumination were longer, and the awake bouts were shorter, at night time compared to daytime, regardless of recording day. The awake bouts also showed an interaction effect with longer bouts at daytime during day 1 compared to daytime on day 3. Data on sleep and awake states recorded in adult dairy cows during three consecutive 24-h periods showed great variation in sleep time between cows, but total time for each state was not significantly affected by recording day.

In human sleep studies, the probability of discomfort from the electrodes and the change in environment usually results in first-night recordings being discarded. Sleep recordings from the first night in human subjects often differ in amount of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and the overall sleep architecture. This study investigated whether recordings of sleep states in dairy cows also show a first-night effect. Non-invasive electrophysiological recordings were carried out on nine cows of the Swedish Red breed during three consecutive 24-hour periods (recording days 1–3). Overall, cows spent 12.9 ± 1.4 hours awake, 8.2 ± 1 hours ruminating, 57.2 ± 20.3 min drowsing, 44.1 ± 20.2 min in REM sleep and 64.3 ± 38.1 min in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (mean ± SD) and there were no significant differences between recording days in total duration for any of the sleep and awake states. However, the bouts of REM sleep and rumination were longer, and the awake bouts were shorter, at night time compared to daytime, regardless of recording day. The awake bouts also showed an interaction effect with longer bouts at daytime during day 1 compared to daytime on day 3. Data on sleep and awake states recorded in adult dairy cows during three consecutive 24-h periods showed great variation in sleep time between cows, but total time for each state was not significantly affected by recording day. Further and more detailed studies of how sleep architecture is affected by recording day is necessary to fully comprehend the first-night effect in dairy cows.</description><fingerprint>47c60dcc</fingerprint><author><name>Emma Ternman</name></author><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First anatomical network analysis of fore- and hindlimb musculoskeletal modularity in bonobos, common chimpanzees, and humans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First anatomical network analysis of fore- and hindlimb musculoskeletal modularity in bonobos, common chimpanzees, and humans, Published online: 02 May 2018;

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutants have been associated with differences in clinical and virological characteristics. Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to alter this process to survive in host cells. In this work, we studied the modulation of autophagy by the replication of HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4, and the naturally occurring mutants BCP and preCore. HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4 replication induced accumulation of autophagosomes in hepatoma cells. However, no autophagic protein degradation was observed, indicating a blockage of autophagic flux at later stages. This inhibition of autophagy flux might be due to an impairment of lysosomal acidification in hepatoma cells. Moreover, HBV-mediated autophagy modulation was independent of the viral subgenotypes and enhanced in viruses with BCP and preCore naturally occurring mutations. These results contribute to understand the mechanisms by which different HBV variants contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV infections. In addition, this study is the first to describe the role that two highly prevalent naturally occurring mutations exert on the modulation of HBV-induced autophagy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197109</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197109</link><unread>True</unread><title>HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4 replication induces an incomplete autophagic process in hepatocytes: Role of BCP and preCore mutations</title><updated>1525813200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197109</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506c:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197109</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by María Mercedes Elizalde, Paula Soledad Pérez, Ina Sevic, Daniel Grasso, Alejandro Ropolo, Luciana Barbini, Rodolfo Héctor Campos, María Inés Vaccaro, Diego Martín Flichman&lt;/p&gt;

Contrary to the mainstream blood group systems, P1PK continues to puzzle and generate controversies over its molecular background. The P1PK system comprises three glycosphingolipid antigens: P&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;, P1 and NOR, all synthesised by a glycosyltransferase called Gb3/CD77 synthase. The P&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; antigen is present in most individuals, whereas P1 frequency is lesser and varies regionally, thus underlying two common phenotypes: P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, if the P1 antigen is present, and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, when P1 is absent. Null and NOR phenotypes are extremely rare. To date, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been proposed to predict the P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; status, but it has not been clear how important they are in general and in relation to each other, nor has it been clear how synthesis of NOR affects the P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phenotype. Here, we quantitatively analysed the phenotypes and &lt;i&gt;A4GALT&lt;/i&gt; transcription in relation to the previously proposed SNPs in a sample of 109 individuals, and addressed potential P1 antigen level confounders, most notably the red cell membrane cholesterol content. While all the SNPs were associated with the P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; blood type and rs5751348 was the most reliable, we found large differences in P1 level within groups defined by their genotype and substantial intercohort overlaps, which shows that the P1PK blood group system still eludes full understanding.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525122000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196627</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196627</link><unread>True</unread><title>Single nucleotide polymorphisms in &amp;lt;i&gt;A4GALT&amp;lt;/i&gt; spur extra products of the human Gb3/CD77 synthase and underlie the P1PK blood group system</title><updated>1525122000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196627</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e56:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196627</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Radoslaw Kaczmarek, Katarzyna Szymczak-Kulus, Anna Bereźnicka, Krzysztof Mikołajczyk, Maria Duk, Edyta Majorczyk, Anna Krop-Watorek, Elżbieta Klausa, Joanna Skowrońska, Bogumiła Michalewska, Ewa Brojer, Marcin Czerwinski&lt;/p&gt;

Furthermore, we show the existence of high water permeability sites in the Turing structures, where water transport through the membranes is enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>5aca4041</fingerprint><keywords><item>Chemistry, Materials Science</item></keywords><author><name>Tan, Z., Chen, S., Peng, X., Zhang, L., Gao, C.</name></author><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>93</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Massimo S.

Past and recent attempts at devising objective biomarkers for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid have focused on abundance measures of time-dependent proteins. Similar independent determinants would be most welcome in diagnosing the most common form of TBI, mild TBI (mTBI), which remains difficult to define and confirm based solely on clinical criteria. There are currently no consensus diagnostic measures that objectively define individuals as having sustained an acute mTBI. Plasma metabolomic analyses have recently evolved to offer an alternative to proteomic analyses, offering an orthogonal diagnostic measure to what is currently available. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a developed set of metabolomic biomarkers is able to objectively classify college athletes sustaining mTBI from non-injured teammates, within 6 hours of trauma and whether such a biomarker panel could be effectively applied to an independent cohort of TBI and control subjects.
A 6-metabolite panel was developed from biomarkers that had their identities confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in our Athlete cohort. These biomarkers were defined at ≤6 hours following mTBI and objectively classified mTBI athletes from teammate controls, and provided similar classification of these groups at the 2, 3, and 7 days post-mTBI. The same 6-metabolite panel, when applied to a separate, independent cohort provided statistically similar results despite major differences between the two cohorts. Our confirmed plasma biomarker panel objectively classifies acute mTBI cases from controls within 6 hours of injury in our two independent cohorts. While encouraged by our initial results, we expect future studies to expand on these initial observations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524258000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195318</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195318</link><unread>True</unread><title>Plasma metabolomic biomarkers accurately classify acute mild traumatic brain injury from controls</title><updated>1524258000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195318</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f3:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195318</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Massimo S.

Human beings are exposed to compressed air or a nitrogen-oxygen mixture, they will produce signs and symptoms of nitrogen narcosis such as amnesia or even loss of memory, which may be disappeared once back to the normobaric environment. This study was designed to investigate the effect of nitrogen narcosis induced by repetitive hyperbaric nitrogen-oxygen mixture exposure on long-term cognitive function in newborn mice and the underlying mechanisms. The electroencephalogram frequency was decreased while the amplitude was increased in a pressure-dependent manner during 0.6, 1.2, 1.8 MPa (million pascal) nitrogen-oxygen mixture exposures in adult mice. Nitrogen narcosis in postnatal days 7–9 mice but not in adult mice induced by repetitive hyperbaric exposure prolonged the latency to find the platform and decreased the number of platform-site crossovers during Morris water maze tests, and reduced the time in the center during the open field tests. An increase in the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in the hippocampus and cortex were observed immediately on the first day after hyperbaric exposure, and this lasted for seven days. Additionally, nitrogen narcosis induced loss of the dendritic spines but not of the neurons, which may mainly account for the cognitive dysfunction. Nitrogen narcosis induced long-term cognitive and emotional dysfunction in the postnatal mice but not in the adult mice, which may result from neuronal apoptosis and especially reduction of dendritic spines of neurons.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524776400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196611</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196611</link><unread>True</unread><title>Nitrogen narcosis induced by repetitive hyperbaric nitrogen oxygen mixture exposure impairs long-term cognitive function in newborn mice</title><updated>1524776400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196611</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefbc:11c251fd</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196611</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bin Peng, Shun-Hua Peng, Run-Ming Qu, Li-Hua Xu, Zheng-Lin Jiang&lt;/p&gt;

Data generated by the PhIP-Seq assay are unique in many ways. The only published analytical approach for these data suffers from important limitations. Here, we propose a new statistical framework with several improvements. Using a set of replicate mock immunoprecipitations (negative controls lacking antibody input) to generate background binding distributions, we establish a statistical model to quantify antibody-dependent changes in phage clone abundance. Our approach incorporates robust regression of experimental samples against the mock IPs as a means to calculate the expected phage clone abundance, and provides a generalized model for calculating each clone&apos;s expected abundance-associated standard deviation. In terms of bias removal and detection sensitivity, we demonstrate that this z-score algorithm outperforms the previous approach. Further, in a large cohort of autoantibody-defined Sjogren&apos;s Syndrome (SS) patient sera, PhIP-Seq robustly identified Ro52, Ro60, and SSB/La as known autoantigens associated with SS. In an effort to identify novel SS-specific binding specificities, SS z-scores were compared with z-scores obtained by screening Ro-positive sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This analysis did not yield any commonly targeted SS-specific autoantigens, suggesting that if they exist at all, their epitopes are likely to be discontinuous or post-translationally modified. In summary, we have developed an improved algorithm for PhIP-Seq data analysis, which was validated using a large set of sera with clinically characterized autoantibodies. This z-score approach will substantially improve the ability of PhIP-Seq to detect and interpret antibody binding specificities.

Data generated by the PhIP-Seq assay are unique in many ways. The only published analytical approach for these data suffers from important limitations. Here, we propose a new statistical framework with several improvements. Using a set of replicate mock immunoprecipitations (negative controls lacking antibody input) to generate background binding distributions, we establish a statistical model to quantify antibody-dependent changes in phage clone abundance. Our approach incorporates robust regression of experimental samples against the mock IPs as a means to calculate the expected phage clone abundance, and provides a generalized model for calculating each clone&apos;s expected abundance-associated standard deviation. In terms of bias removal and detection sensitivity, we demonstrate that this z-score algorithm outperforms the previous approach. Further, in a large cohort of autoantibody-defined Sjogren&apos;s Syndrome (SS) patient sera, PhIP-Seq robustly identified Ro52, Ro60, and SSB/La as known autoantigens associated with SS. In an effort to identify novel SS-specific binding specificities, SS z-scores were compared with z-scores obtained by screening Ro-positive sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This analysis did not yield any commonly targeted SS-specific autoantigens, suggesting that if they exist at all, their epitopes are likely to be discontinuous or post-translationally modified. In summary, we have developed an improved algorithm for PhIP-Seq data analysis, which was validated using a large set of sera with clinically characterized autoantibodies. This z-score approach will substantially improve the ability of PhIP-Seq to detect and interpret antibody binding specificities.

Fitting canine cancer incidences through a conventional regression model assumes constant statistical relationships across the study area in estimating the model coefficients. However, it is often more realistic to consider that these relationships may vary over space. Such a condition, known as spatial non-stationarity, implies that the model coefficients need to be estimated locally. In these kinds of local models, the geographic scale, or spatial extent, employed for coefficient estimation may also have a pervasive influence. This is because important variations in the local model coefficients across geographic scales may impact the understanding of local relationships. In this study, we fitted canine cancer incidences across Swiss municipal units through multiple regional models. We computed diagnostic summaries across the different regional models, and contrasted them with the diagnostics of the conventional regression model, using value-by-alpha maps and scalograms. The results of this comparative assessment enabled us to identify variations in the goodness-of-fit and coefficient estimates. We detected spatially non-stationary relationships, in particular, for the variables related to biological risk factors. These variations in the model coefficients were more important at small geographic scales, making a case for the need to model canine cancer incidences locally in contrast to more conventional global approaches. However, we contend that prior to undertaking local modeling efforts, a deeper understanding of the effects of geographic scale is needed to better characterize and identify local model relationships.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523653200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195970</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195970</link><unread>False</unread><title>The importance of regional models in assessing canine cancer incidences in Switzerland</title><updated>1523653200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195970</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179363c:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195970</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gianluca Boo, Stefan Leyk, Christopher Brunsdon, Ramona Graf, Andreas Pospischil, Sara Irina Fabrikant&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The survival rate of childhood cancer patients increased over the past decades. However, even after successful treatment the transition back to normalcy is often a major challenge for the whole family. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families in the first years after the end of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA Checklist (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017059782). In November 2016 and September 2017, we searched the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, and Web of Science. We included studies investigating psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors diagnosed under the age of 21, their family members or the family as a whole. Further, we summarized the study characteristics and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results. Finally, we assessed the study quality with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 8215 records based on our database searches and 17 additional records through hand searches. We included 33 articles in the qualitative synthesis. Most of the studies described interventions for the cancer survivor (n = 15). Nine studies investigated interventions for the whole family, and two studies interventions for siblings. The interventions mainly take place in an outpatient group setting (n = 15). Overall, most of the studies reported a significant psychosocial benefit of the interventions.

Background &lt;p&gt;The survival rate of childhood cancer patients increased over the past decades. However, even after successful treatment the transition back to normalcy is often a major challenge for the whole family. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families in the first years after the end of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA Checklist (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017059782). In November 2016 and September 2017, we searched the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, and Web of Science. We included studies investigating psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors diagnosed under the age of 21, their family members or the family as a whole. Further, we summarized the study characteristics and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results. Finally, we assessed the study quality with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 8215 records based on our database searches and 17 additional records through hand searches. We included 33 articles in the qualitative synthesis. Most of the studies described interventions for the cancer survivor (n = 15). Nine studies investigated interventions for the whole family, and two studies interventions for siblings. The interventions mainly take place in an outpatient group setting (n = 15). Overall, most of the studies reported a significant psychosocial benefit of the interventions. However, the quality of the included studies was limited.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In summary, we identified a broad range of different interventions and thus could give a comprehensive overview of existing interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families. However, there is a necessity for high quality studies. The results may help to optimize health care services that support families with the re-entry into daily life.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>44fd683a</fingerprint><author><name>Mona Leandra Peikert</name></author><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><published>1523662234000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell, Volume 173, Issue 1&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Stacie E.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Epiretinal traction is not responsible only for epiretinal but also intraretinal changes. This study aims to describe structural and vascular intraretinal changes after macular peeling in idiopathic (iERM) vs diabetic ERM (dERM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective interventional study on forty-two eyes, 23 with iERMs and 19 with dERMs, undergoing ERM-ILM peeling. We performed SD-OCT preoperatively, 1 and 6 months postoperatively to assess central macular thickness (CMT), intraretinal cysts (IC) and/or continuous ectopic inner foveal layers (CEIFL), superficial and deep capillary free zone (CFZ) area on OCT-A. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as a Müller cells marker, was detected immunohistochemically on ILM specimens, to assess Müller cells iatrogenic damage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The CEIFLs were significantly more common in iERMs (12 (52.2%) in iERMs vs 2 (10.5%) in dERMs, p = 0.004), whereas ICs in dERMs (6 (26.1%) in iERMs vs 17 (89.5%) in dERMs, p&amp;lt;0.001). Median preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/50 [20/40-20/66] and 20/33 [20/25-20/40] in iERMs and 20/100 [20/66-20/200] and 20/50 [20/50-20/66] in dERMs, respectively. Median preoperative and postoperative CMT was 423 [370–488] and 364 [329–382] μm in iERM group and 465 [447–503] and 378 [359–433] μm in dERM group, respectively. The BCVA improvement and reduction of CMT thickness were significant in both groups (p&amp;lt;0.001). The presence of CEIFL was associated with lower BCVA in iERMs. Deep CFZ network significantly increased only in dERMs, passing from 0.34 [0.29–0.42] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; preoperatively to 0.56 [0.46–0.6] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 6-month follow-up (p&amp;lt;0.001). The GFAP expression was significantly higher in dERMs (p = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The intraretinal changes are different in iERMs and dERMs, as increased expression of CEIFLs in iERMs vs ICs in dERMs. The CEIFLs are associated with worse anatomical and functional outcomes in iERMs, whereas GFAP espression in peeled ILMs is higher in dERMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197065</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197065</link><unread>True</unread><title>Intraretinal changes in idiopathic versus diabetic epiretinal membranes after macular peeling</title><updated>1525813200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197065</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475067:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197065</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mario R.

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups.

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation.</description><fingerprint>46fbfa4e</fingerprint><author><name>Christi Patten</name></author><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>Skin is the largest organ in the body and serves important barrier, regulatory, and sensory functions.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Product packaging has long been used by the tobacco industry to target consumers and manipulate product perceptions. This study examines the extent to which cigarillo packaging influences perceptions of product flavor, taste, smell, and appeal.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A web-based experiment was conducted among young adults. Participants viewed three randomly selected cigarillo packs, varying on pack flavor descriptor, color, type, branding, and warning—totaling 180 pack images. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effect of pack elements on product perceptions.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 2,664 current, ever, and never little cigar and cigarillo users participated. Cigarillo packs with a flavor descriptor were perceived as having a more favorable taste (β = 0.21, p &amp;lt; .001) and smell (β = 0.14, p &amp;lt; .001) compared to packs with no flavor descriptor. Compared to packs with no color, pink and purple packs were more likely to be perceived as containing a flavor (β = 0.11, p &amp;lt; .001), and were rated more favorably on taste (β = 0.17, p &amp;lt; .001), smell (β = 0.15, p &amp;lt; .001), and appeal (β = 0.16, p &amp;lt; .001). While warnings on packs decreased favorable perceptions of product taste (pictorial: β = -0.07, p = .03) and smell (text-only: β = -0.08, p = .01; pictorial: β = -0.09, p = .007), warnings did not moderate the effects of flavor descriptor or color.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantitative evidence that cigarillo packaging alters consumers’ cognitive responses, and warnings on packs do not suffice to overcome the effects of product packaging. The findings support efforts at federal, state, and local levels to prohibit flavor descriptors and their associated product flavoring in non-cigarette products such as cigarillos, along with new data that supports restrictions on flavor cues and colors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524171600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</link><unread>True</unread><title>The effect of cigarillo packaging elements on young adult perceptions of product flavor, taste, smell, and appeal</title><updated>1524171600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f7902:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Clare Meernik, Leah M.

If you live in the US, you’ve surely seen various cancer treatment centers talking about their personalized therapy plans, and especially how they’ll tailor things to your DNA sequence and so on. You would get the impression that we have an arsenal of specifically targeted cancer therapies, waiting for patients to get their tumors sequenced so they can be paired with the optimal treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not true. I wish it were, but it just isn’t. And I fear that a lot of patients and their families actually believe that it is, which can make for some bad decisions (both medically and financially). I can hardly blame them much, though, because for years now there’s been a ceaseless flow of stories in the press about targeted therapies, genomic sequencing of patients, breakthroughs, advances, new DNA this and advanced sequence that and on and on. I think it’s safe to say that the average patient does not have the time nor the expertise to keep up with the actual biomedical literature, and thus relies on headlines and advertisements for an impression of the field, and that impression is pretty far off of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; article, which covers a debate at the recent AACR meeting between David Hyman and Vinay Prasad, estimates that only about 15% of patients total are currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/precision-medicine/tumor-dna-sequencing&quot;&gt;even eligible&lt;/a&gt; (under FDA guidelines) to have their tumors sequenced in hope of matching with a targeted therapy. About one third-of those may actually benefit from the process in the end. This is not exactly what you’d expect if all you knew about this stuff was what you heard on TV. The thing is, that’s actually a great advance, because the number used to be zero, in both categories. We really are making progress, and the people who can benefit really can benefit. It’s just that there aren’t nearly as many of them as we’d like, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can’t pin this just on clueless news readers – even back in 2003, the head of the NCI (later head of the FDA, Andy Eschenbach) &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2012/02/23/remember_when_we_were_going_to_eliminate_deaths_from_cancer&quot;&gt;was talking&lt;/a&gt; about “eliminating death and suffering” due to cancer by. . .2015. We have missed that deadline. In 2006 (as that link shows), he was going on in a similar way about how we’d moved to a whole new level, everything had changed, etc. In general, whenever someone starts talking about “the next level” or something like that, I check to make sure my wallet is still in my pocket. This isn’t a game we’re working through – it doesn’t have “levels”, and in fact, not many large complicated real-world things do. Quantized jumps happen on the microscale. Up here, we’re grinding it out, and that’s how cancer therapy is advancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the confusion is that people have different ideas about what “precision targeting” in oncology really is. The term got applied early on to the wave of kinase inhibitors and so on that targeted particular cellular mechanisms (rather than just being wrecking balls like some of the earlier chemotherapy drugs), and that muddied things a bit. Some of the earlier successes in this area came about because some (relatively rare) tumor types really do seem to be pretty genetically homogeneous: they occur in pretty much the same way for the same reasons. So if you target that mechanism, you’re likely to see an effect; it’s like the situation in many human genetic disorders, and it doesn’t happen that way in cancer too often. But the high-profile successes against things like GIST confused some parts the public, I think, into thinking that the different bodily locations of cancer were all like that – genetically distinct from cancer in other organs, but very similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would that it were so. The second level of confusion comes to the DNA-sequencing aspect, which is at least closer to reality in terms of how cancer works, if not its treatment. “OK’, this story goes, “this patient has (something)oma, so let’s take some cells and see what variety of it they have so we can give them the drug that works against that subtype”. That’s what too many people think we have now, and what in a few cases we actually do (as above). But most of the time we don’t really understand what’s going on at a cellular level, as gets proven every time another promising oncology mechanism wipes out in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even with those successes, there’s room to wonder how far this idea can be pushed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/12/precision-oncology-isnt-quite-there-yet&quot;&gt;Here’s a piece on that&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 (more Vinay Prasad), wondering just how precise it’s possible to get. One big problem is that many solid tumors are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/08/16/cancer_cells_too_unstable_for_fine_targeting&quot;&gt;terrible mixture&lt;/a&gt; of cell types. They generally got that way by being &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/20/glioblastoma-is-bad-news-period&quot;&gt;genomically unstable&lt;/a&gt;, and that unstability just goes on and on. That’s where all this fine targeting really runs into trouble: what if a given patient’s tumor is a mixture of eight or nine different cellular forms of cancer? Well, eight or nine that you know about so far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s one reason that immuno-oncology is such a hot field, because (to a first approximation) it’s saying “OK, we don’t know how all you cells became cancerous and we don’t care. We can set it up so that (for example) you all get recognized by killer T cells, and they will take you out no matter what your pedigree”. Problem is, we’re not quite to this stage for all but a very few forms of cancer. By far the most successful are blood-based cancers like leukemia, where the cells really are quite similar to each other by oncology standards, giving you a chance to wipe them out &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;. Getting that to happen for solid tumors is. . .not so easy. The more successful immuno-oncology for solid tumors, so far, is using antibodies to go after potential common mechanisms like PD-L1 that are fending off such T-cell attack, but (a) we don’t have such markers for most solid tumors, and (b) in many cases, the most we can do now, usually, is to wipe out most of of a patient’s tumors (best case) leaving behind an untouched residue of mutated cells that eventually comes back in untreatable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not putting that down at all – this can buy people substantial more life, although not always. In every case, you have to see (with real-world clinical data) how much actual survival you’ve been able to achieve. That’s another big reason that we missed that absurd 2015 date, because it takes years to figure out just how well these therapies actually work in practice. It’s a slog, and I don’t see any way for it not to be a slog, and it’s too bad that that doesn’t make for a very compelling slogan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525270408000</published><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/02/cancer-sequencing-hype-and-reality</canonicalUrl><summary><content>This piece in Science says something that needs to be said louder and more publicly.

Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-protein complexes in a number of bacterial pathogens that can translocate proteins and DNA to the host. Most T4SSs function in conjugation and translocate DNA; however, approximately 13% function to secrete proteins, delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. Upon entry, these effectors manipulate the host cell’s machinery for their own benefit, which can result in serious illness or death of the host. For this reason recognition of T4SS effectors has become an important subject. Much previous work has focused on verifying effectors experimentally, a costly endeavor in terms of money, time, and effort. Having good predictions for effectors will help to focus experimental validations and decrease testing costs. In recent years, several scoring and machine learning-based methods have been suggested for the purpose of predicting T4SS effector proteins. These methods have used different sets of features for prediction, and their predictions have been inconsistent. In this paper, an optimal set of features is presented for predicting T4SS effector proteins using a statistical approach. A thorough literature search was performed to find features that have been proposed. Feature values were calculated for datasets of known effectors and non-effectors for T4SS-containing pathogens for four genera with a sufficient number of known effectors, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp, and &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. The features were ranked, and less important features were filtered out. Correlations between remaining features were removed, and dimensional reduction was accomplished using principal component analysis and factor analysis. Finally, the optimal features for each pathogen were chosen by building logistic regression models and evaluating each model. The results based on evaluation of our logistic regression models confirm the effectiveness of our four optimal sets of features, and based on these an optimal set of features is proposed for all T4SS effector proteins.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</link><unread>True</unread><title>An optimal set of features for predicting type IV secretion system effector proteins for a subset of species based on a multi-level feature selection approach</title><updated>1525899600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bedc:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhila Esna Ashari, Nairanjana Dasgupta, Kelly A.

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells.

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF &lt;i&gt;OCT4&lt;/i&gt;, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and to endodermal tumor formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types.</description><fingerprint>f5bc41f2</fingerprint><author><name>Rangarajan Sambathkumar</name></author><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>159</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&lt;i&gt;Ras&lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&amp;lt;i&gt;Ras&amp;lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23840-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23840-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&lt;i&gt;Ras&lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ZDUJHhIumw4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524466800000</published><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23840-2/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23840_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>508</width><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23840-2</link><unread>True</unread><title>Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-Ras transformed human mammary epithelial cells</title><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23840-2</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23840-2</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162f1d1745e:5d8411b:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/ZDUJHhIumw4/s41598-018-23840-2</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&lt;i&gt;Ras&lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&amp;lt;i&gt;Ras&amp;lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23840-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23840-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&lt;i&gt;Ras&lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ZDUJHhIumw4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>c930ccfc</fingerprint><author><name>Young-Il Hahn</name></author><crawled>1524475458654</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>Background: The effective visualization and presentation of biological data is of critical importance to research scientists.

Background &lt;p&gt;The molecular characterization of endometrial cancer (EC) can facilitate identification of various tumor subtypes. Although EC patients with &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations reproducibly demonstrate better prognosis, the outcome of patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) remains controversial. This study attempted to interrogate whether genetic stratification of EC can identify distinct subsets with prognostic significance.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A cohort of 138 EC patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent was enrolled. Sanger sequencing was used to evaluate mutations in the &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; genes. MSI analysis was performed using four mononucleotide repeat markers and methylation status of the &lt;i&gt;MLH1&lt;/i&gt; promoter was measured by a fluorescent bisulfite polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Protein expression for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Extensive hypermethylation of the &lt;i&gt;MLH1&lt;/i&gt; promoter was observed in 69.6% ECs with MLH1 deficiency and 3.5% with MMR proficiency, but in none of the ECs with loss of other MMR genes (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .0001). MSI-positive and &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations were found in 29.0% and 8.7% EC patients, respectively. Our MSI analysis showed a sensitivity of 92.7% for EC patients with MMR deficiency, and a specificity of 97.9% for EC patients with MMR proficiency. In univariate and multivariate analyses, &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations and &lt;i&gt;MSI&lt;/i&gt; status was significantly associated with progression-free survival (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0129 and 0.0064, respectively) but not with endometrial cancer-specific survival.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study provides significant evidence that analyses of proofreading &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations and MSI status based on mononucleotide repeat markers are potentially useful biomarkers to identify EC patients with better prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523912400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195655</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195655</link><unread>True</unread><title>Clinical impact of endometrial cancer stratified by genetic mutational profiles, &amp;lt;i&gt;POLE&amp;lt;/i&gt; mutation, and microsatellite instability</title><updated>1523912400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195655</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ada:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195655</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoko Haruma, Takeshi Nagasaka, Keiichiro Nakamura, Junko Haraga, Akihiro Nyuya, Takeshi Nishida, Ajay Goel, Hisashi Masuyama, Yuji Hiramatsu&lt;/p&gt;

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, almost exclusively female lung disease linked to inactivating mutations in &lt;i&gt;tuberous sclerosis complex 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TSC2)&lt;/i&gt;, a tumor suppressor gene that controls cell metabolic state and growth via regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) signaling. mTORC1 is frequently activated in human cancers and, although the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has a cytostatic effect, it is, in general, unable to elicit a robust curative effect or tumor regression. Using RNA-Seq, we identified (1) &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like Growth Factor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt;) as one of the genes with the highest fold-change difference between human &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-null and &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-expressing angiomyolipoma cells from a patient with LAM, and (2) the mouse &lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt; homolog &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt;, as a top-ranking gene according to fold change between &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We extended transcript-level findings to protein level, observing increased Igf2 protein expression and Igf2 secretion by &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. Increased Igf2 expression was not due to epigenetic imprinting, but was partially mediated through the Stat3 pathway and was completely insensitive to rapamycin treatment. An siRNA-mediated decrease of Igf2 resulted in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation, suggesting presence of an autocrine Igf2/Stat3 amplification cycle in &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. In human pulmonary LAM lesions and metastatic cell clusters, high levels of IGF2 were associated with mTORC1 activation. In addition, treatment of three primary IGF2-expressing LAM lung cell lines with rapamycin did not result in IGF2 level changes.

Variation in cortical connectivity profiles is typically modeled as having a coarse spatial scale parcellated into interconnected brain areas. We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PKWzqyJ_2Tk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523998800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006120</link><recrawled>1523997724770</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>A computational model of shared fine-scale structure in the human connectome</title><updated>1523998800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006120</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006120</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162d4ba762b:4bed5d:bdf8aaf1</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/PKWzqyJ_2Tk/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006057</link><recrawled>1525984928890</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Nonlinear decoding of a complex movie from the mammalian retina</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006057</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006057</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1634b3364f4:491e38:abeb7260</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0tROk9h9FSA/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vicente Botella-Soler, Stéphane Deny, Georg Martius, Olivier Marre, Gašper Tkačik&lt;/p&gt;

Disturbances in one-carbon metabolism, intracellular reactions involved in nucleotide synthesis and methylation, likely increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, results have been inconsistent. To explore whether this inconsistency could be explained by intertumoral heterogeneity, we evaluated a comprehensive panel of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers and some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in relation to the risk of molecular subtypes of CRC defined by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; oncogenes. This nested case-control study included 488 CRC cases and 947 matched controls from two population-based cohorts in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. We analyzed 14 biomarkers and 17 SNPs in prediagnostic blood and determined &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; mutation status in tumor tissue. In a multivariate network analysis, no variable displayed a strong association with the risk of specific CRC subtypes. A non-synonymous SNP in the &lt;i&gt;CTH&lt;/i&gt; gene, rs1021737, had a stronger association compared with other variables. In subsequent univariate analyses, participants with variant rs1021737 genotype had a decreased risk of &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt;-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.50, 1.05), and an increased risk of &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt;-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.07, 2.30), with weak evidence for heterogeneity (P&lt;sub&gt;heterogeneity&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01).

Disturbances in one-carbon metabolism, intracellular reactions involved in nucleotide synthesis and methylation, likely increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, results have been inconsistent. To explore whether this inconsistency could be explained by intertumoral heterogeneity, we evaluated a comprehensive panel of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers and some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in relation to the risk of molecular subtypes of CRC defined by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; oncogenes. This nested case-control study included 488 CRC cases and 947 matched controls from two population-based cohorts in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. We analyzed 14 biomarkers and 17 SNPs in prediagnostic blood and determined &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; mutation status in tumor tissue. In a multivariate network analysis, no variable displayed a strong association with the risk of specific CRC subtypes. A non-synonymous SNP in the &lt;i&gt;CTH&lt;/i&gt; gene, rs1021737, had a stronger association compared with other variables. In subsequent univariate analyses, participants with variant rs1021737 genotype had a decreased risk of &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt;-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.50, 1.05), and an increased risk of &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt;-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.07, 2.30), with weak evidence for heterogeneity (P&lt;sub&gt;heterogeneity&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01). This subtype-specific SNP association was not replicated in a case-case analysis of 533 CRC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (P = 0.85). In conclusion, we found no support for clear subtype-specific roles of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers and SNPs in CRC development, making differences in CRC molecular subtype distributions an unlikely explanation for the varying results on the role of one-carbon metabolism in CRC development across previous studies.

To date, the RV144 HIV vaccine trial has been the only study to show that immunization can confer protection from HIV infection. While encouraging, the modest 31.2% (P = 0.04) efficacy achieved in this study left significant room for improvement, and created an incentive to optimize the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine immunogens to increase the level of vaccine efficacy. Since the completion of the RV144 trial, our understanding of the antigenic structure of the HIV envelope protein, gp120, and of the specificity of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) that bind to it, has significantly improved. In particular, we have learned that multiple families of bN-mAbs require specific oligomannose glycans for binding. Both of the monomeric gp120 immunogens (MN- and A244-rgp120) in the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine used in the RV144 trial were enriched for glycans containing high levels of sialic acid, and lacked critical N-linked glycosylation sites required for binding by several families of bN-mAbs. The absence of these epitopes may have contributed to the low level of efficacy achieved in this study. In this report, we describe our efforts to improve the antigenic structure of the rgp120 immunogens used in the vaccine by optimizing glycan-dependent epitopes recognized by multiple bN-mAbs. Our results demonstrated that by shifting the location of one PNGS in A244-rgp120, and by adding two PNGS to MN-rgp120, in conjunction with the production of both proteins in a cell line that favors the incorporation of oligomannose glycans, we could significantly improve the binding by three major families of bN-mAbs. The immunogens described here represent a second generation of gp120-based vaccine immunogens that exhibit potential for use in RV144 follow-up studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524603600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196370</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196370</link><unread>True</unread><title>Glycan modifications to the gp120 immunogens used in the RV144 vaccine trial improve binding to broadly neutralizing antibodies</title><updated>1524603600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196370</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb2:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196370</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rachel C.

Reduced climatic suitability due to climate change in cocoa growing regions of Ghana is expected in the coming decades. This threatens farmers’ livelihood and the cocoa sector. Climate change adaptation requires an improved understanding of existing cocoa production systems and farmers’ coping strategies. This study characterized current cocoa production, income diversification and shade tree management along a climate gradient within the cocoa belt of Ghana. The objectives were to 1) compare existing production and income diversification between dry, mid and wet climatic regions, and 2) identify shade trees in cocoa agroforestry systems and their distribution along the climatic gradient. Our results showed that current mean cocoa yield level of 288kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the dry region was significantly lower than in the mid and wet regions with mean yields of 712 and 849 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. In the dry region, farmers diversified their income sources with non-cocoa crops and off-farm activities while farmers at the mid and wet regions mainly depended on cocoa (over 80% of annual income). Two shade systems classified as medium and low shade cocoa agroforestry systems were identified across the studied regions. The medium shade system was more abundant in the dry region and associated to adaptation to marginal climatic conditions. The low shade system showed significantly higher yield in the wet region but no difference was observed between the mid and dry regions. This study highlights the need for optimum shade level recommendation to be climatic region specific.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523912400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195777</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195777</link><unread>True</unread><title>Characterization of cocoa production, income diversification and shade tree management along a climate gradient in Ghana</title><updated>1523912400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195777</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae1:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195777</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Issaka Abdulai, Laurence Jassogne, Sophie Graefe, Richard Asare, Piet Van Asten, Peter Läderach, Philippe Vaast&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) induces a systemic inflammatory state affecting iron homeostasis. Patients with TB often have additional comorbidities such as anemia which can result in poorer treat outcomes. We studied the contribution of anemia and the role of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin among TB patients and household contacts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed serum samples from 102 TB cases and 98 controls without TB, matched by age/sex, for hepcidin, iron, and inflammation parameters. Five controls developed TB within 12 months. We used linear regression to assess associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) was more frequent among cases than controls (59.8% vs. 26.1%), but iron-deficiency anemia more frequent in controls (10% vs. 1%). The median hepcidin level was higher in cases than controls (63.7 vs. 14.2 ng/mL), but coinfections with HIV, helminths, and respiratory pathogens did not show cumulative effects. Hepcidin was associated with more severe TB symptom scoring (coefficient 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5–1.2) and higher mycobacterial load (0.7, 95% CI 0.4–1.0). Hepcidin was higher in TB cases and controls who developed TB compared to controls without TB (p&amp;lt;0.001), even when restricting to HIV-negative study participants.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;ACD was the predominate etiology in TB patients suggesting limited benefit from iron supplementation. Increased hepcidin levels long before active disease, indicating altered iron metabolism, may be a marker for developing disease among TB-exposed individuals. Clinical management of anemia and nutrition interventions in TB patients need to be considered to improve the clinical course and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524258000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195985</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195985</link><unread>True</unread><title>Anemia in tuberculosis cases and household controls from Tanzania: Contribution of disease, coinfections, and the role of hepcidin</title><updated>1524258000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195985</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fd:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195985</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jerry Hella, Colin I.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. Over the past several decades, many &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous and woody plants. However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (&lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt;) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523912400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</link><unread>True</unread><title>Genome-wide analysis of basic helix-loop-helix superfamily members in peach</title><updated>1523912400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aed:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chunhua Zhang, Ruchao Feng, Ruijuan Ma, Zhijun Shen, Zhixiang Cai, Zhizhong Song, Bin Peng, Mingliang Yu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests the presence of structural changes affecting the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in patients with Brugada Syndrome (BrS). The aim of this study was to characterise the RV morphology in BrS and explore associations between morphologic, clinical, electrical, and genetic parameters using non-invasive multimodality testing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive BrS patients (recruited 2013–2015) underwent clinical assessment, dedicated RV imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (unless contra-indicated), electrical assessment (electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring, signal-averaged ECG[SAECG]) and genotyping. Morphologic data were compared to matched control and unmatched ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) cohorts, and potential associations between morphologic parameters and other variables were explored.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;BrS patients (n = 42, male 86%, age 46±12 years) exhibited normal global RV volume and function, comparable to control, in contrast to significantly larger, impaired RVs in ARVC cohort (RVESV p = 0.0001; RVEDV p&amp;lt;0.0001, RVEF p = 0.002).

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests the presence of structural changes affecting the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in patients with Brugada Syndrome (BrS). The aim of this study was to characterise the RV morphology in BrS and explore associations between morphologic, clinical, electrical, and genetic parameters using non-invasive multimodality testing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive BrS patients (recruited 2013–2015) underwent clinical assessment, dedicated RV imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (unless contra-indicated), electrical assessment (electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring, signal-averaged ECG[SAECG]) and genotyping. Morphologic data were compared to matched control and unmatched ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) cohorts, and potential associations between morphologic parameters and other variables were explored.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;BrS patients (n = 42, male 86%, age 46±12 years) exhibited normal global RV volume and function, comparable to control, in contrast to significantly larger, impaired RVs in ARVC cohort (RVESV p = 0.0001; RVEDV p&amp;lt;0.0001, RVEF p = 0.002). Compared with control, BrS patients exhibited larger RVOT volumes (7.4 ± 0.7 vs 5.8 ± 0.7 mL/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) (31% vs 0%, p = 0.005); compared with ARVC cohort, the RVOT volumes were similar (7.4 ± 0.7 vs, 8.1 ± 1.7, p = 0.52) and there were less RWMA (31% vs 76%, p = 0.01). Overall 67% BrS patients had abnormal RVOT morphology. Patients with abnormal RVOT tended to be older (48 ± 12 y vs 41 ± 12y, p = 0.06). Rare genetic variants were only observed in patients with abnormal RVOT morphology (36% vs 0%, p = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with BrS frequently exhibit structural abnormalities localised to the RVOT and these changes may be age- and gene-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>a2399181</fingerprint><author><name>Belinda Gray</name></author><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Computed tomography for evaluating right ventricle and pulmonary artery in pediatric tetralogy of Fallot: correlation with post-operative pulmonary regurgitation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computed tomography for evaluating right ventricle and pulmonary artery in pediatric tetralogy of Fallot: correlation with post-operative pulmonary regurgitation, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25868-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25868-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Computed tomography for evaluating right ventricle and pulmonary artery in pediatric tetralogy of Fallot: correlation with post-operative pulmonary regurgitation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/_0VxO01KieE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526281200000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25868-w</link><unread>True</unread><title>Computed tomography for evaluating right ventricle and pulmonary artery in pediatric tetralogy of Fallot: correlation with post-operative pulmonary regurgitation</title><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25868-w</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25868-w</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1635df0c4bc:2e36448:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/_0VxO01KieE/s41598-018-25868-w</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Computed tomography for evaluating right ventricle and pulmonary artery in pediatric tetralogy of Fallot: correlation with post-operative pulmonary regurgitation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computed tomography for evaluating right ventricle and pulmonary artery in pediatric tetralogy of Fallot: correlation with post-operative pulmonary regurgitation, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25868-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25868-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Computed tomography for evaluating right ventricle and pulmonary artery in pediatric tetralogy of Fallot: correlation with post-operative pulmonary regurgitation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/_0VxO01KieE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>ec7cca76</fingerprint><author><name>Yue Gao</name></author><crawled>1526289450172</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><published>1523851200000</published><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00818/20180416/images/medium/jp-2018-008186_0005.gif</url><width>500</width><height>262</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00818/20180416/images/medium/jp-2018-008186_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00818&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

According to the Climatic Variability Hypothesis [CVH], thermal plasticity should be wider in organisms from temperate environments, but is unlikely to occur in tropical latitudes where temperature fluctuations are narrow. In copepods, food availability has been suggested as the main driver of phenotypic variability in adult size if the range of temperature change is less than 14°C. &lt;i&gt;Leptodiaptomus garciai&lt;/i&gt; is a calanoid copepod inhabiting Lake Alchichica, a monomictic, tropical lake in Mexico that experiences regular, narrow temperature fluctuations but wide changes in phytoplankton availability. We investigated whether the seasonal fluctuations of temperature and food produce phenotypic variation in the life-history traits of this tropical species. We sampled &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;garciai&lt;/i&gt; throughout a year and measured female size, egg size and number, and hatching success, along with temperature and phytoplankton biomass. The amplitude of the plastic responses was estimated with the Phenotypic Plasticity Index. This index was also computed for a published dataset of 84 copepod populations to look if there is a relationship between the amplitude of the phenotypic plasticity of adult size and seasonal change in temperature. The temperature annual range in Lake Alchichica was 3.2°C, whereas phytoplankton abundance varied 17-fold. A strong pattern of thermal plasticity in egg size and adult female size followed the inverse relationship with temperature commonly observed in temperate environments, although its adaptive value was not demonstrated.

According to the Climatic Variability Hypothesis [CVH], thermal plasticity should be wider in organisms from temperate environments, but is unlikely to occur in tropical latitudes where temperature fluctuations are narrow. In copepods, food availability has been suggested as the main driver of phenotypic variability in adult size if the range of temperature change is less than 14°C. &lt;i&gt;Leptodiaptomus garciai&lt;/i&gt; is a calanoid copepod inhabiting Lake Alchichica, a monomictic, tropical lake in Mexico that experiences regular, narrow temperature fluctuations but wide changes in phytoplankton availability. We investigated whether the seasonal fluctuations of temperature and food produce phenotypic variation in the life-history traits of this tropical species. We sampled &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;garciai&lt;/i&gt; throughout a year and measured female size, egg size and number, and hatching success, along with temperature and phytoplankton biomass. The amplitude of the plastic responses was estimated with the Phenotypic Plasticity Index. This index was also computed for a published dataset of 84 copepod populations to look if there is a relationship between the amplitude of the phenotypic plasticity of adult size and seasonal change in temperature. The temperature annual range in Lake Alchichica was 3.2°C, whereas phytoplankton abundance varied 17-fold. A strong pattern of thermal plasticity in egg size and adult female size followed the inverse relationship with temperature commonly observed in temperate environments, although its adaptive value was not demonstrated. Egg number, relative reproductive effort and number of nauplii per female were clearly plastic to food availability, allowing organisms to increase their fitness. When comparing copepod species from different latitudes, we found that the magnitude of thermal plasticity of adult size is not related to the range of temperature variation; furthermore, thermal plasticity exists even in environments of limited temperature variation, where the response is more intense compared to temperate populations.</description><fingerprint>8aa287d7</fingerprint><author><name>Elizabeth Ortega-Mayagoitia</name></author><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>Motivation: Motif discovery in large biopolymer sequence datasets can be computationally demanding, presenting significant challenges for discovery in omics research.

Iron plays vital roles in the human body including enzymatic processes, oxygen-transport via hemoglobin and immune response. Iron metabolism is characterized by ~95% recycling and minor replenishment through diet. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a lack of synthesis of erythropoietin leading to reduced red blood cell (RBC) formation and aberrant iron recycling. Treatment of CKD anemia aims to normalize RBC count and serum hemoglobin. Clinically, the various fluxes of iron transport and accumulation are not measured so that changes during disease (e.g., CKD) and treatment are unknown. Unwanted iron accumulation in patients is known to lead to adverse effects. Current whole-body models lack the mechanistic details of iron transport related to RBC maturation, transferrin (Tf and TfR) dynamics and assume passive iron efflux from macrophages. Hence, they are not predictive of whole-body iron dynamics and cannot be used to design individualized patient treatment. For prediction, we developed a mechanistic, multi-scale computational model of whole-body iron metabolism incorporating four compartments containing major pools of iron and RBC generation process. The model accounts for multiple forms of iron &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, mechanisms involved in iron uptake and release and their regulation. Furthermore, the model is interfaced with drug pharmacokinetics to allow simulation of treatment dynamics. We calibrated our model with experimental and clinical data from peer-reviewed literature to reliably simulate CKD anemia and the effects of current treatment involving combination of epoietin-alpha and iron dextran. This &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; whole-body model of iron metabolism predicts that a year of treatment can potentially lead to 90% downregulation of ferroportin (FPN) levels, 15-fold increase in iron stores with only a 20% increase in iron flux from the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Model simulations quantified unmeasured iron fluxes, previously unknown effects of treatment on FPN-level and iron stores in the RES. This mechanistic whole-body model can be the basis for future studies that incorporate iron metabolism together with related clinical experiments. Such an approach could pave the way for development of effective personalized treatment of CKD anemia.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mfiym6I-5Rs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523912400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006060</link><recrawled>1523911321731</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Whole-body iron transport and metabolism: Mechanistic, multi-scale model to improve treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease</title><updated>1523912400000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006060</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006060</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14cf:bdf8aaf1</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/mfiym6I-5Rs/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joydeep Sarkar, Alka A.

Sexual transmission is the principal driver of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic. Understanding HIV vaccine-induced immune responses at mucosal surfaces can generate hypotheses regarding mechanisms of protection, and may influence vaccine development. The RV144 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00223080) efficacy trial showed protection against HIV infections but mucosal samples were not collected, therefore, the contribution of mucosal antibodies to preventing HIV-1 acquisition is unknown. Here, we report the generation, magnitude and persistence of antibody responses to recombinant gp120 envelope and antigens including variable one and two loop scaffold antigens (gp70V1V2) previously shown to correlate with risk in RV144. We evaluated antibody responses to gp120 A244gD and gp70V1V2 92TH023 (both CRF01_AE) and Case A2 (subtype B) in cervico-vaginal mucus (CVM), seminal plasma (SP) and rectal secretions (RS) from HIV-uninfected RV144 vaccine recipients, who were randomized to receive two late boosts of ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E, AIDSVAX®B/E, or ALVAC-HIV alone at 0 and 6 months. Late vaccine boosting increased IgG geometric mean titers (GMT) to gp120 A244gD in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM (28 and 17 fold, respectively), followed by SP and RS. IgG to gp70V1V2 92TH023 increased in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM (11–17 fold) and SP (2 fold) two weeks post first boost. IgG to Case A2 was only detected in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM. Mucosal IgG to gp120 A244gD (CVM, SP, RS), gp70V1V2 92TH023 (CVM, SP), and Case A2 (CVM) correlated with plasma IgG levels (p&amp;lt;0.001). Although the magnitude of IgG responses declined after boosting, anti-gp120 A244gD IgG responses in CVM persisted for 12 months post final vaccination. Further studies in localization, persistence and magnitude of envelope specific antibodies (IgG and dimeric IgA) in anogenital secretions will help determine their role in preventing mucosal HIV acquisition.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196397</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196397</link><unread>True</unread><title>Characterization of HIV-1 gp120 antibody specificities induced in anogenital secretions of RV144 vaccine recipients after late boost immunizations</title><updated>1524862800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196397</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d748:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196397</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siriwat Akapirat, Chitraporn Karnasuta, Sandhya Vasan, Supachai Rerks-Ngarm, Punnee Pitisuttithum, Sirinan Madnote, Hathairat Savadsuk, Surawach Rittiroongrad, Jiraporn Puangkaew, Sanjay Phogat, James Tartaglia, Faruk Sinangil, Mark S. de Souza, Jean-Louis Excler, Jerome H.

Microbicides are an important strategy for preventing the sexual transmission of HIV but, so far, the most advanced tenofovir-based microbicides have had modest efficacy. This has been related to adherence problems and high prevalence of tenofovir-resistant HIV-1 strains. P3 is a new peptide with potent activity against HIV that may be a good microbicide candidate. In this work P3 was formulated in a gel of hydroxyethyl cellulose and its activity, stability and safety profile in Balb/c mice were evaluated. HIV infection was fully blocked by a 1.5% gel containing P3 at the IC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; (366.4 nM) concentration. The antiviral activity did not change at 4°C during 4 months and at 25, 37 and 65°C for 1 week. P3 was stable and fully functional at acidic pH up to 24h, under different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and in the presence of genital fluids up to 48h. P3 had no antibacterial activity and did not affect sperm motility and vitality. Finally, P3 didn’t cause significant alterations in the vaginal epithelium of Balb/c mice at 0.06 (456.8 μM) and 0.2 mg/day (1522.7 μM) doses. These findings indicate that P3 is an excellent candidate for further development as a microbicide gel for the prevention of HIV transmission in women.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524085200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195744</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195744</link><unread>True</unread><title>Evaluation of the fusion inhibitor P3 peptide as a potential microbicide to prevent HIV transmission in women</title><updated>1524085200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195744</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccb1:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195744</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inês Bártolo, Ana Rita Diniz, Pedro Borrego, João Pedro Ferreira, Maria Rosário Bronze, Helena Barroso, Rui Pinto, Carlos Cardoso, João F.

Although heterosis has significantly contributed to increases in worldwide crop production, the molecular mechanisms regulating this phenomenon are still unknown. In the present study, we used a comparative proteomic approach to explore hybrid vigor via the proteome of both the popcorn L54 ♀ and P8 ♂ genotypes and the resultant UENF/UEM01 hybrid cross. To analyze the differentially abundant proteins involved in heterosis, we used the primary roots of these genotypes to analyze growth parameters and extract proteins. The results of the growth parameter analysis showed that the mid- and best-parent heterosis were positive for root length and root dry matter but negative for root fresh matter, seedling fresh matter, and protein content. The comparative proteomic analysis identified 1343 proteins in the primary roots of hybrid UENF/UEM01 and its parental lines; 220 proteins were differentially regulated in terms of protein abundance. The mass spectrometry proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier “PXD009436”. A total of 62 regulated proteins were classified as nonadditive, of which 53.2% were classified as high parent abundance (+), 17.8% as above-high parent abundance (+ +), 16.1% as below-low parent abundance (− −), and 12.9% as low parent abundance (-). A total of 22 biological processes were associated with nonadditive proteins; processes involving translation, ribosome biogenesis, and energy-related metabolism represented 45.2% of the nonadditive proteins. Our results suggest that heterosis in the popcorn hybrid UENF/UEM01 at an early stage of plant development is associated with an up-regulation of proteins related to synthesis and energy metabolism.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526331600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197114</link><unread>True</unread><title>Differentially abundant proteins associated with heterosis in the primary roots of popcorn</title><updated>1526331600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197114</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd3:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197114</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mathias F.

These reactions have a lot of variables in them and can be notoriously finicky about what combination of these will actually give decent amounts of product. At the same time, it appears that almost any given metal-catalyzed coupling reaction is capable of being optimized, if you care enough. So this is a good field for both miniaturized reaction searching (as in the link above) and for machine learning (as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/186&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s going after what’s often an even more challenging case, the C-N &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchwald%E2%80%93Hartwig_amination&quot;&gt;Buchwald-Hartwig&lt;/a&gt; coupling. That one gets used a lot in medicinal chemistry (we like nitrogen atoms), but it’s also a well-known beast when it comes to variation in yield. You can honestly never be quite sure that it’s going to work well when you set it up on a new system for the first time, because there are a lot of conditions (solvent, catalyst, additives) to pick from, and often very little guidance about which region of reaction space is going to be most fruitful. This work, a Princeton/Merck collaboration, is an attempt to calculate a way out of the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the two approaches mentioned in the first paragraph are not an either/or case. Far from it. If you’re going to do machine learning, you’re going to need a lot of reliable data (positive and negative) to feed into the model, and how better to generate that than in an automated, high-throughput setup? That’s especially true as you start adding in more reaction variables: every one of those can increase the complexity of the machine learning model in an exponential fashion, and stuff gets out of control quickly under those conditions. So the question is, can ML provide something useful here, and can it outperform the simpler-to-implement regression models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d definitely want robotic help up front: the data set was the yields from 4,608 coupling reactions  (15 aryl or heteroaryl halides, 4 ligands, 3 bases, and 23 isoxazole additives). About 30% of the reactions gave no product at all – valuable fodder for the model – and the rest were spread in a wide range from “pretty darn good” to “truly crappy”. Just what you need. At this point, you need to figure out just what you’re going to tell the system about these reactions (a nontrivial decision). Too few (or wrongly chosen) parameters, and you’ll never get a useful model. Too many, and you risk an overfitted model that looks good from a distance but is both hard to implement and still not robust. In this case, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartan_(software)&quot;&gt;Spartan&lt;/a&gt; program &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/02/14/science.aar5169.DC1/aar5169-Ahenman-SM_revision_1.pdf&quot;&gt;is used to provide&lt;/a&gt; atomic, molecular, and vibrational descriptors of the substrate(s), catalysts, bases, and additives. So what goes in are electrostatics at various atoms, vibrational modes (frequencies and intensities), dipole moments, electronegativity, surface areas, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the team took 70% of the data as a training set to see if they could predict the outcomes in the other 30%, and ran the data through a whole set of possibilities: linear and polynomial regression for starters, then k-nearest neighbors, Bayes-generalized linear models, layered neural networks, random-forest techniques, etc. Only when they got to that last two did they start to see real predictive value, and random-forest seems to have been the clear winner. Its predictions, even using only 5% of the data, were better than linear-regression models tuned up on the whole 70%. But even so, there were limits. “Activity cliffs” are always a problem in these reactions, and those are hard to pick up (even with 4,608 reactions to train on!) The wider the range of chemical/reaction space you’re trying to cover with your model, the better the chance you’re going to miss these things (and the better the chance you’re going to end up with an overfitted model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way out of that is to restrict your question to a narrower region of potential reactions (and thus get more fine detail into the model). But that, naturally, makes it less useful: after all, the dream is a Buchwald-Hartwig Box, where you walk up, draw the structures of your two reactants (no matter what they might be), and it pauses for a moment and spits out a set of good reaction conditions. That’s. . .still a little ways off. But I do have to say that this current effort beats both human intuition (insofar as anyone has any about these reactions) and other attempts to calculate likely starting points. So it is a real improvement, and the finding that random-forest techniques outperformed everything else is worth building on, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group did try putting in some additives that were not in the training set at all, to see how the model would handle them. And the answer is “not bad”: the root-mean-square error in predicted yields for the original test set versus reference set was about 8%, and the RMSE for the new additive set was about 11%. So it was not quite as good, but on the right track. (By comparison, the single-layer neural network model had about a 10% error on the original set, while the other methods came in at 15 to 16%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggested a look at the final random-forest procedure to see if there was anything that could be learned about the mechanism (a tall order, from what I know about the field). Some of the most important descriptors were things like electrostatic charge on the isoxazole additive’s atoms, its calculated LUMO, and its carbon NMR shifts. That suggests that the additive’s electrophilic behavior was important, but those parameters taken by themselves weren’t enough to produce any kind of useful model on their own. Still, a check of isoxazoles from both ends of the scale suggested that the more electrophilic ones were capable of undergoing a side reaction with the Pd catalyst that reduced yields, which may well be what the model was picking up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’d say that this paper does show (as have some others) that machine-learning techniques are going to help us out eventually in predicting reaction conditions, even if that day has not quite arrived. When you get down to it, the parameters going into this model are not particularly complicated, so it may well be a good sign that it’s worked as well as it has. You’d have to think that larger data sets and new inputs can only going to make these things perform better (after plenty of human effort and care, of course), and that’s leaving aside the general possibility of improved algorithms. I think we’ll get there, but we’re not there now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524660632000</published><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/25/calculate-your-way-out-of-bad-yields</canonicalUrl><summary><content>I wrote a little while back about a brute-force approach to finding metal-catalyzed coupling conditions.

The forces driving the accumulation and removal of non-coding DNA and ultimately the evolution of genome size in complex organisms are intimately linked to genome structure and organisation. Our analysis provides a novel method for capturing the regional variation of lineage-specific DNA gain and loss events in their respective genomic contexts. To further understand this connection we used comparative genomics to identify genome-wide individual DNA gain and loss events in the human and mouse genomes. Focusing on the distribution of DNA gains and losses, relationships to important structural features and potential impact on biological processes, we found that in autosomes, DNA gains and losses both followed separate lineage-specific accumulation patterns. However, in both species chromosome X was particularly enriched for DNA gain, consistent with its high L1 retrotransposon content required for X inactivation. We found that DNA loss was associated with gene-rich open chromatin regions and DNA gain events with gene-poor closed chromatin regions. Additionally, we found that DNA loss events tended to be smaller than DNA gain events suggesting that they were able to accumulate in gene-rich open chromatin regions due to their reduced capacity to interrupt gene regulatory architecture. GO term enrichment showed that mouse loss hotspots were strongly enriched for terms related to developmental processes. However, these genes were also located in regions with a high density of conserved elements, suggesting that despite high levels of DNA loss, gene regulatory architecture remained conserved. This is consistent with a model in which DNA gain and loss results in turnover or “churning” in regulatory element dense regions of open chromatin, where interruption of regulatory elements is selected against.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H1rMm4y09CQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524258000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006091</link><recrawled>1524246129185</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Divergent genome evolution caused by regional variation in DNA gain and loss between human and mouse</title><updated>1524258000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006091</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006091</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162e4229578:4d4f95:76251cdd</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/H1rMm4y09CQ/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Reuben M.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are one of the important factors in controlling gene expression and elucidation of their roles has been attracting great interest. We have developed an improved method for analyzing a large variety of mutant CRE sequences in a simple and high-throughput manner. In our approach, mutant CREs with unique barcode sequences were obtained by biased randomization in a single PCR amplification. The original T7 promoter sequence was randomized by biased randomization, and the target number of base substitutions was set to be within the range of 0 to 5. The DNA library and subsequent transcribed RNA library were sequenced by next generation sequencers (NGS) to quantify transcriptional activity of each mutant. We succeeded in producing a randomized T7 promoter library with high coverage rate at each target number of base substitutions. In a single NGS analysis, we quantified the transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants. We confirmed that the bases from −9 to −7 play an important role in the transcriptional activity of the T7 promoter. This information coincides with the previous researches and demonstrated the validity of our methodology. Furthermore, using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; transcription/translation system, we found that transcriptional activities of these T7 variants were well correlated with the resultant protein abundance. We demonstrate that our method enables simple and high-throughput analysis of the effects of various CRE mutations on transcriptional regulation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196905</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196905</link><unread>True</unread><title>High-throughput evaluation of T7 promoter variants using biased randomization and DNA barcoding</title><updated>1525726800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196905</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4225c:5785ab88</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196905</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Komura, Wataru Aoki, Keisuke Motone, Atsushi Satomura, Mitsuyoshi Ueda&lt;/p&gt;

The Tasmanian devil (&lt;i&gt;Sarcophilus harrisii)&lt;/i&gt;, the largest extant carnivorous marsupial and endemic to Tasmania, is at the verge of extinction due to the emergence of a transmissible cancer known as devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). DFTD has spread over the distribution range of the species and has been responsible for a severe decline in the global devil population. To protect the Tasmanian devil from extinction in the wild, our group has focused on the development of a prophylactic vaccine. Although this work has shown that vaccine preparations using whole DFTD tumour cells supplemented with adjuvants can induce anti-DFTD immune responses, alternative strategies that induce stronger and more specific immune responses are required. In humans, heat shock proteins (HSPs) derived from tumour cells have been used instead of whole-tumour cell preparations as a source of antigens for cancer immunotherapy. As HSPs have not been studied in the Tasmanian devil, this study presents the first characterisation of HSPs in this marsupial and evaluates the suitability of these proteins as antigenic components for the enhancement of a DFTD vaccine. We show that tissues and cancer cells from the Tasmanian devil express constitutive and inducible HSP. Additionally, this study suggests that HSP derived from DFTD cancer cells are immunogenic supporting the future development of a HSP-based vaccine against DFTD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196469</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196469</link><unread>True</unread><title>Heat shock proteins expressed in the marsupial Tasmanian devil are potential antigenic candidates in a vaccine against devil facial tumour disease</title><updated>1524862800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196469</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d74b:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196469</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cesar Tovar, Amanda L.

The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of CPP-ACP and fluorides compared with fluorides monotherapy on patients with early caries lesions. The Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases up to August 2017 were scanned, with no restrictions. Studies satisfied the guideline of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the patients with early caries lesions and data considering the efficacy of fluorides and CPP-ACP versus fluorides alone were selected. There was no language restriction during the literature search process, however, only papers in English or Chinese were included during the selection process. Outcome variables include laser fluorescence, quantitative light-induced fluorescence, lesion area and visual inspection scores. Mean differences were calculated during the data extraction process. Ten studies including 559 patients were selected in the meta-analysis. Fluorides combined with CPP-ACP achieved the same efficacy for early caries lesions on smooth surfaces compared with fluorides monotherapy (mean difference: -13.90, 95% confidence interval: [-39.25, 11.46], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.28), and the combination treatment showed significantly better efficacy than fluorides monotherapy for occlusal early caries lesions (mean difference: -21.02, 95% confidence interval: [-27.94, -14.10], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).

Distance between rows and plants are essential parameters that affect the final grain yield in row crops. This paper presents the results of research intended to develop a novel method to quantify the distance between maize plants at field scale using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Using this method, we can recognize maize plants as objects and calculate the distance between plants. We initially developed our method by training an algorithm in an indoor facility with plastic corn plants. Then, the method was scaled up and tested in a farmer’s field with maize plant spacing that exhibited natural variation.

Distance between rows and plants are essential parameters that affect the final grain yield in row crops. This paper presents the results of research intended to develop a novel method to quantify the distance between maize plants at field scale using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Using this method, we can recognize maize plants as objects and calculate the distance between plants. We initially developed our method by training an algorithm in an indoor facility with plastic corn plants. Then, the method was scaled up and tested in a farmer’s field with maize plant spacing that exhibited natural variation. The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to precisely quantify the distance between maize plants. We found that accuracy of the measurement of the distance between maize plants depended on the height above ground level at which UAV imagery was taken. This study provides an innovative approach to quantify plant-to-plant variability and, thereby final crop yield estimates.</description><fingerprint>f0fe591b</fingerprint><author><name>Jinshui Zhang</name></author><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>Rapid development and wide adoption of mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies have empowered scientists to study proteins and their modifications in complex samples on a large scale.

This obviously is most important (and can have the biggest effect) if your compound has a short half-life after dosing to begin with (and plenty of compounds do). As the paper notes, if you have constant clearance for the unbound fraction of your compound, then the relationship between dose and half-life is exponential, not linear (whereas most of the other combinations you can come up with are simply linear ones). That really gives you a handle to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, you don’t have to wait until human data to worry about such things. The allometric scaling factor between rats and humans is about 4.3, so if you’ve done your homework about what the mechanisms of clearance are (which enzymes are responsible and how well they correlate to human ones, for example), you’re ready to work from there. The paper notes, though, that these sorts of correlations have a much higher chance of going haywire on you for very short half-life compounds (less than two hours, say), so if you want to have any confidence at all in your dose prediction models, you really should get rat half-life out longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group shows a plot of about 10,000 Merck compounds with rat measurements of unbound-clearance versus steady-state volume of distribution, and it’s (as you might figure) a pretty good correlation. The key, then, is to find changes in a molecule’s structure that will get it off that line, because otherwise you’ll end up in a similar situation to where you started. That is, you can find yourself reducing the unbound clearance and ending up with an effective half life that’s not really improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what sorts of modifications actually improve the half-life? The paper shows the result of a large matched-molecular-pairs (MMP) analysis, where structures were varied at only one place. Increasing lipophilicity will do the trick, sometimes, if the partitioning of your compound into tissue increases more than just its binding to plasma proteins. The Merck data suggest that adding multiple fluorines to a compound’s structure tends to have this effect. The fluorinated compounds tend, apparently, to bind to tissue at an increased rate more than they bind to serum albumin. You may or may not be comfortable with this advice, since polyfluorinated compounds may also be harder to formulate, and some of that tissue binding may be to things that you’d rather not bind to. But it will increase your half-life, and it’s up to each med-chem team to see if they want to make that deal with this particular fluorocarbon-coated devil. The free lunch has (still) not yet arrived in the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, another classic way to increase half-life is to block sites of metabolism. The Merck group noted this in a general way with matched molecular pairs that changed hydrogens to chlorines, hydrogens to methyls, and methyls to chlorines. H to Cl increased half life, presumably for similar reasons to fluorination. H to methyl did not, though: that does increase lipophilicity, but at the expense of adding new groups for the liver enzymes to chew on. But methyl to chloro did improve half-lives, on average – the lipophilicities are nearly the same, but you’ve battened down the hatches for enzymatic degradation. (As you’d imagine, H to CF3 is the extreme example of this effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about replacing with more polar groups, rather than with nonstick coatings? On average, phenyl to pyridyl lowers half life, H to OH does too, and H to COOH &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lowers half-life. It’s worth noting that the carboxylic acids, overall, tend to have higher binding to plasma protein, so that tells you that the increased half-life of the halogenated compounds isn’t coming about by that mechanism, at least not exclusively. It’s worth noting, though, that just greasing up your compounds is not the answer. Fluorination and chlorination seem to work, but as a look at the broader MMP universe shows, increasing lipophilicity in general does not necessarily help your half-life. Decreasing lipophilicity, on the other hand, has a much better chance of hurting it. It looks, overall, as if the steady-state volume of distribution is more sensitive to modifications in the structure than is clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper has a list of groups that seem to help with increasing half-life, more often than not, and ones that seem to hurt. In addition to general halogenation, others in the first beneficial category include primary amines, NH pyrrolidines, piperidines, piperazines, and morpholines, 3,4-dihaloaryls, and (interestingly) 2-methyl-4-pyrimidones. In the likely-to-lower category, on the other hand, are pyridines and pyrimidines attached at the 2 position, N-attached pyrazoles (and other related 5-membered heterocycles that have that core), unsubstituted phenyls (and 4-pyridyls), primary alcohols, and simple cyclopropyls.

When tested on a large-scale proteomic dataset consisting of 18.4 million spectra (including 11.5 million spectra of charge 2+), SPLASH runs 7.6-12.1x faster than the state-of-the-art spectra clustering software, PRIDE Cluster, while achieves higher clustering sensitivity and comparable accuracy. Using the consensus spectra reported by SPLASH, commonly used spectra search engines MSGF+ and Mascot can identify 5% and 4% more unique peptides, respectively, comparing to the identification results from the raw MS/MS spectra at the same false discovery rate (1% FDR) of peptides. SPLASH is implemented in C++, and is released as open source software.</description><fingerprint>28649662</fingerprint><author><name>Wang, L.</name></author><crawled>1524697542120</crawled><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308627v1?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>6</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Akinori Higaki, Masaki Mogi, Jun Iwanami, Li-Juan Min, Hui-Yu Bai, Bao-Shuai Shan, Harumi Kan-no, Shuntaro Ikeda, Jitsuo Higaki, Masatsugu Horiuchi&lt;/p&gt;
The Morris water maze test (MWM) is a useful tool to evaluate rodents’ spatial learning and memory, but the outcome is susceptible to various experimental conditions. Thigmotaxis is a commonly observed behavioral pattern which is thought to be related to anxiety or fear. This behavior is associated with prolonged escape latency, but the impact of its frequency in the early stage on the final outcome is not clearly understood. We analyzed swim path trajectories in male C57BL/6 mice with or without bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) treatment. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of particular types of trajectories according to ischemic brain surgery. The mouse groups with thigmotaxis showed significantly prolonged escape latency and lower cognitive score on day 5 compared to those without thigmotaxis. As the next step, we made a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize the swim path trajectories. Our model could distinguish thigmotaxis from other trajectories with 96% accuracy and specificity as high as 0.98. These results suggest that thigmotaxis in the early training stage is a predictive factor for impaired performance in MWM, and machine learning can detect such behavior easily and automatically.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525381200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197003</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197003</link><unread>True</unread><title>Recognition of early stage thigmotaxis in Morris water maze test with convolutional neural network</title><updated>1525381200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197003</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af6:5785ab88</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197003</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Akinori Higaki, Masaki Mogi, Jun Iwanami, Li-Juan Min, Hui-Yu Bai, Bao-Shuai Shan, Harumi Kan-no, Shuntaro Ikeda, Jitsuo Higaki, Masatsugu Horiuchi&lt;/p&gt;

Secreted Nano-luciferase (secNluc) is a newly engineered secreted luciferase that possesses advantages of high structural stability, long half-life, and glow-type kinetics together with high light emission intensity, and thus would become one of the most valuable tools for bioluminescence assays. However, like other secreted luciferases, secNluc has to mix with the components in the conditioned medium surrounding test cells, or in the biological samples such as blood or urine after being secreted. These components may interfere with secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions and thus limit the application of the secNluc reporter system. In this study, we first examined the effects of three factors, pH, serum and residual reagents, on secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions, finding that these factors could interfere with bioluminescence reactions and result in background signal. To resolve these problems, we applied a simple affinity purification strategy in which secNluc was fused with a FLAG-tag, and anti-FLAG magnetic beads were used to catch and transfer the fusion protein to PBST, an optimal buffer for secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions that was identified in this study. The results indicated that this strategy could not only negate the interferences from serum or residual reagents and enhance the stability of light emission but also greatly increase signal intensity through enzyme enrichment. This strategy may contribute to biomedical studies that utilize secNluc and other secreted luciferases, especially those requiring superior sensitivity, low background noise and high reproducibility.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196617</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196617</link><unread>True</unread><title>Optimized application of the secreted Nano-luciferase reporter system using an affinity purification strategy</title><updated>1525294800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196617</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a180:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196617</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by JingZhe Li, ZhiLan Guo, Takashi Sato, Bo Yuan, YanYan Ma, Dan Qian, JuYing Zhong, MengMeng Jin, Peng Huang, LuYang Che, Yi Wang, Yan Lei, ChangZhen Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Several investigations suggest the presence of deterioration of executive function in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The study quantified executive functions in patients with FMS. A wide array of functions was assessed, including updating, shifting and inhibition, as well as decision making and mental planning. Moreover, clinical variables were investigated as possible mediators of executive dysfunction, including pain severity, psychiatric comorbidity, medication and body mass index (BMI).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Fifty-two FMS patients and 32 healthy controls completed a battery of 14 neuropsychological tests. Clinical interviews were conducted and the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Fatigue Severity Scale and Oviedo Quality of Sleep Questionnaire were presented.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patients performed poorer than controls on the Letter Number Sequencing, Arithmetic and Similarities subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Spatial Span subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale, an N-back task, a verbal fluency task, the Ruff Figural Fluency Test, the Inhibition score of the Stroop Test, the Inhibition and Shifting scores of the Five Digits Test, the Key Search Test and the Zoo Map Task. Moreover, patients exhibited less steep learning curves on the Iowa Gambling Task. Among clinical variables, BMI and pain severity explained the largest proportion of performance variance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study demonstrated impairments in executive functions of updating, shifting inhibition, decision making and planning in FMS. While the mediating role of pain in cognitive impairments in FMS had been previously established, the influence of BMI is a novel finding.

High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been shown &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to impinge on telomere homeostasis in a number of ways. However, the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; interaction of viruses with the telomere homeostasis apparatus has not been previously explored. Since E6 and E7 are the main viral oncogenes and key for viral replication, we have explored here the short-term phenotypes of the genes in the context of defective telomere homeostasis. We examined the short-term phenotypes of E6 and E7 in a context where the Terc component of the telomerase holoenzyme was knocked out. We determined that Terc was dispensable for most oncogene-mediated phenotypes. Surprisingly, E7-mediated reduction of label retaining cells was found to be in part dependent on the presence of Terc. Under the conditions examined here, there appears to be no compelling evidence Terc is required for most short-term viral oncogene mediated phenotypes.

I’ve been mentioning this technique on the blog since its early days, and I freely admit that when it was starting out I had trouble believing that it worked (or even could work). The idea, in short, is that you  append a short bit of DNA to a small-molecule starting material, and then elaborate that into a combinatorial library of compounds while the DNA is still attached. The key part is that after each step, you use molecular biology techniques to add more DNA bases to the end, and these sequences are deliberately chosen to encode the synthetic history of the compound as it’s been branched out. You can have a huge number of these things, since you split out into hundreds or thousands of individual wells along the way, each one of which gets a discrete building block (and a corresponding discrete DNA oligo “bar code” ligated to it. That process is the first use of molecular biology, since the enzymes involved are very good at their jobs indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, once you’ve recombined, you’ve got a small volume of solution in which there might be (should be, in fact) many millions of compounds, each with its own DNA tag. At this point, you run a screen for binding, washing off everything to leave only the tight binders, and you use PCR and modern sequencing to figure out the DNA sequences of what’s left. And that’s the back-end use of molecular biology, because this combination of techniques allows you to identify extremely small amounts of material, as long as it has a DNA sequence attached to it. When you get the sequences, you go back to your master key and figure out which compounds those were. . .OK, scaffold 1. . .with an aminopyrrolidine at the first position. . . and the (R)-methyl side chain in the next step. . .and capped off with heterocycle number forty-eight. That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the time-consuming step kicks in: synthesizing these things “off-DNA”. You most certainly do not have fifty million individual vials sitting downstairs, each with a fifty-mg sample of each member of the DNA-encoded library. That would be 2500 kilos of stuff, and that’s neglecting the weight of the vials! You’d need a serious building to hold the “real” samples of one DNA-encoded library, and that’s exactly what you’re trying to avoid ever having to do. So you head back to the hood and make the non-DNA forms of these hits (as many as you think appropriate or feasible) and see how they bind in that form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the point where my mental picture really began to break down when I first heard about this. A small molecule with enough DNA attached to it to be a useful bar code, in my mind, looked like a canoe towing an aircraft carrier. I had trouble believing that these things would screen in a meaningful way, and trouble believing that you wouldn’t just get a hit set that was dominated by all sorts of DNA-driven interactions (since there’s so much more DNA in that vial than there is small-molecule chemical matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, those concerns are not idiotic, but they don’t keep the idea from working, either. (I try to keep this example in mind whenever I’m evaluating a new technology). As that new short review illustrates, DEL screening does indeed work, and by now it has delivered compound series that have advanced to the clinic. Once you’ve made a DEL, the screening technique for it doesn’t vary all that much (in most cases), and you can try variations without too much trouble. These screens burn up less protein than most other HTS efforts, and a single DEL, once produced, is generally good for re-use in a large number of screens. The tough part, as mentioned, is the workup of the results The sequencing has gotten easier and cheaper over the years, as has the sheer number-crunching of figuring out what compounds hit and what the relationships are between them. Resynthesis, though, is still pretty much the same delirious happiness it’s always been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How large should these things be? There have been some reports of ridiculously huge libraries (billions, up towards a trillion compounds), but as Satz notes, there’s very little information about these and no sign that they’re producing more or better hits. His own experience seems to be that collections with (theoretical) compound counts in the millions/tens of millions have much better signal-to-noise and that at least under current conditions, going higher may well be a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has some thoughts about where DEL technology might be going. As always, one possibility is the availability of new chemistries that can be performed in the presence of the DNA bar codes. The diversity of the libraries has been more dependent on the variety of the building blocks than the reactions used to put them together. Another idea that would open things up more would be to have a way to have the DNA barcodes present but allow the compounds themselves to be cut free under the assay conditions (in order to run cellular and functional assays). There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscombsci.6b00192&quot;&gt;several schemes&lt;/a&gt; being worked on to realize this, and they’re deserving of another post in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524748933000</published><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/26/dna-libraries-are-here-to-stay</canonicalUrl><summary><content>Here’s an update from Alex Satz of Roche on DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening.

Background and objective &lt;p&gt;Potential hepatoxicity is an important clinical concern when administering immunosuppressive therapies to patients infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV). Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF) increase the likelihood of hepatitis consequent to HBV reactivation, but reported risks and outcomes vary. We determined the risks of liver enzyme elevation in anti-rheumatic drug users from an HBV-endemic region with differing HBV serostatus.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We established retrospective cohorts with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis who: 1) received anti-TNF agents from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2013; 2) received care from 1 June 2011 to 30 June 2013 but only ever used conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Serology results defined three subgroups: HBV surface antigen positive (HBsAg+), HBsAg negative/HBV core antibody positive (HBsAg−/HBcAb+), or uninfected. We compared incidences of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) exceeding twice the upper reference limit between HBV serostatus subgroups in each treatment cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 783 patients treated with anti-TNF (n = 472) or DMARDs only (n = 311), HBsAg−/HBcAb+ anti-TNF users had incidence of ALT elevation commensurate with uninfected counterparts (6.1 vs. 6.0/100 person-years), compared to 19.6/100 person-years in HBsAg+ patients (standardized rate ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.3–8.2); none effected had severe or fatal hepatitis and ALT levels in all HBsAg−/HBcAb+ patients remained stable, mostly normalizing spontaneously, or after moderating treatment. Patterns of of ALT elevation associated with differing HBV serostatus in the DMARD cohort, resembled those in anti-TNF users.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this large HBV-endemic cohort, the absolute incidence of ALT elevation in anti-TNF users was more than three-fold higher in HBsAg+ patients than in uninfected counterparts; however, no such association was evident in patients with HBsAg−/HBcAb+ serotype, whose risk and outcomes of liver enzyme elevation were similar to uninfected patients, suggesting that anti-TNF use by HBsAg−/HBcAb+ patients is probably safe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524690000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196210</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196210</link><unread>True</unread><title>Commensurate incidence and outcomes of liver enzyme elevation between anti-tumor necrosis factor users with or without prior hepatitis B virus infections</title><updated>1524690000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196210</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fdf3a72a:5f7703:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196210</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ying-Ming Chiu, Mei-Shu Lai, K.

We compared incidences of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) exceeding twice the upper reference limit between HBV serostatus subgroups in each treatment cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 783 patients treated with anti-TNF (n = 472) or DMARDs only (n = 311), HBsAg−/HBcAb+ anti-TNF users had incidence of ALT elevation commensurate with uninfected counterparts (6.1 vs. 6.0/100 person-years), compared to 19.6/100 person-years in HBsAg+ patients (standardized rate ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.3–8.2); none effected had severe or fatal hepatitis and ALT levels in all HBsAg−/HBcAb+ patients remained stable, mostly normalizing spontaneously, or after moderating treatment. Patterns of of ALT elevation associated with differing HBV serostatus in the DMARD cohort, resembled those in anti-TNF users.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this large HBV-endemic cohort, the absolute incidence of ALT elevation in anti-TNF users was more than three-fold higher in HBsAg+ patients than in uninfected counterparts; however, no such association was evident in patients with HBsAg−/HBcAb+ serotype, whose risk and outcomes of liver enzyme elevation were similar to uninfected patients, suggesting that anti-TNF use by HBsAg−/HBcAb+ patients is probably safe.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>13fdb6f9</fingerprint><author><name>Ying-Ming Chiu</name></author><crawled>1524679026474</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DNA points to a frog-killer’s birthplace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA points to a frog-killer’s birthplace, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05138-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05138-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Pathogen first appeared when the amphibian trade began to boom.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525935600000</published><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05138-5/d41586-018-05138-5_15749210.jpg</url><width>1024</width><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05138-5</link><unread>True</unread><title>DNA points to a frog-killer’s birthplace</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05138-5</originId><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1634bb877aa:16a4998:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05138-5</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DNA points to a frog-killer’s birthplace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA points to a frog-killer’s birthplace, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05138-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05138-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Pathogen first appeared when the amphibian trade began to boom.</description><engagementRate>0.02</engagementRate><fingerprint>1c686944</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1525983770538</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>3</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interleukin-6: designing specific therapeutics for a complex cytokine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-6: designing specific therapeutics for a complex cytokine, Published online: 04 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.45&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dysregulation of IL-6 signalling is associated with inflammatory and lymphoproliferative disorders, and several classes of therapeutics have been developed that target components of the IL-6 signalling pathway.

GABA is a robust regulator of both developing and mature neural networks. It exerts many of its effects through GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, which are heteropentamers assembled from a large array of subunits encoded by distinct genes. In mammals, there are 19 different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; subunit types, which are divided into the α, β, γ, δ, ε, π, θ and ρ subfamilies. The immense diversity of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors is not fully understood. However, it is known that specific isoforms, with their distinct biophysical properties and expression profiles, tune responses to GABA. Although larval zebrafish are well-established as a model system for neural circuit analysis, little is known about GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors diversity and expression in this system. Here, using database analysis, we show that the zebrafish genome contains at least 23 subunits. All but the mammalian θ and ε subunits have at least one zebrafish ortholog, while five mammalian GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits have two zebrafish orthologs. Zebrafish contain one subunit, β4, which does not have a clear mammalian ortholog. Similar to mammalian GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, the zebrafish α subfamily is the largest and most diverse of the subfamilies. In zebrafish there are eight α subunits, and RNA &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization across early zebrafish development revealed that they demonstrate distinct patterns of expression in the brain, spinal cord, and retina. Some subunits were very broadly distributed, whereas others were restricted to small populations of cells. Subunit-specific expression patterns in zebrafish resembled were those found in frogs and rodents, which suggests that the roles of different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor isoforms are largely conserved among vertebrates. This study provides a platform to examine isoform specific roles of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors within zebrafish neural circuits and it highlights the potential of this system to better understand the remarkable heterogeneity of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196083</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196083</link><unread>True</unread><title>Expression of the eight GABA&amp;lt;sub&gt;A&amp;lt;/sub&gt; receptor α subunits in the developing zebrafish central nervous system</title><updated>1524862800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196083</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d73b:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196083</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bryan Monesson-Olson, Jon J.

Many patients previously using darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) (800/100mg) have switched to darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/C) (800/150 mg) either as part of triple therapy (ART) or as monotherapy with DRV (mDRV). The latter approach continues to be used in some countries for patients receiving long-term treatment. However, to date, the behaviour of DRV/C in the seminal compartment has not been analysed. This study explores how the combination behaves in monotherapy, with respect to the control of viral load and seminal quality. To this end, we studied 20 patients who were treated with mDRV/C after previous treatment with mDRV/r for at least 24 weeks. A viral load control in seminal plasma similar to that published in the literature was observed after 24 weeks of treatment with mDRV/C (viral load positivity in 20% of patients). Similarly, semen quality was confirmed (70% normozoospermic) in patients treated with this formulation, as has previously been reported for ART and mDRV/r. The DRV levels measured in seminal plasma were above EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, regardless of whether the seminal viral load was positive or negative. We conclude that this mDRV/C co-formulation behaves like mDRV/r in seminal plasma in terms of viral load control and semen quality.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524603600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196257</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196257</link><unread>True</unread><title>Effect of monotherapy with darunavir/cobicistat on viral load and semen quality of HIV-1 patients</title><updated>1524603600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196257</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa4:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196257</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Miguel A.

This study explores how the combination behaves in monotherapy, with respect to the control of viral load and seminal quality. To this end, we studied 20 patients who were treated with mDRV/C after previous treatment with mDRV/r for at least 24 weeks. A viral load control in seminal plasma similar to that published in the literature was observed after 24 weeks of treatment with mDRV/C (viral load positivity in 20% of patients). Similarly, semen quality was confirmed (70% normozoospermic) in patients treated with this formulation, as has previously been reported for ART and mDRV/r. The DRV levels measured in seminal plasma were above EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, regardless of whether the seminal viral load was positive or negative. We conclude that this mDRV/C co-formulation behaves like mDRV/r in seminal plasma in terms of viral load control and semen quality.</description><fingerprint>edc7ab8f</fingerprint><author><name>Miguel A.

Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district. We corroborated earlier reports on the importance of viral load and age as mortality predictors and identified jaundice and bleeding to be features with highest predictive value at presentation.

Endometrial Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (endMSCs) are multipotent cells with immunomodulatory and pro-regenerative activity which is mainly mediated by a paracrine effect. The exosomes released by MSCs have become a promising therapeutic tool for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. More specifically, extracellular vesicles derived from endMSCs (EV-endMSCs) have demonstrated a cardioprotective effect through the release of anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic factors. Here we hypothesize that EV-endMSCs may be used as a co-adjuvant to improve &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; fertilization outcomes and embryo quality. Firstly, endMSCs and EV-endMSCs were isolated and phenotypically characterized for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays. Then, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies were performed on murine embryos co-cultured with EV-endMSCs at different concentrations. Our results firstly demonstrated a significant increase on the total blastomere count of expanded murine blastocysts. Moreover, EV-endMSCs triggered the release of pro-angiogenic molecules from embryos demonstrating an EV-endMSCs concentration-dependent increase of VEGF and PDGF-AA. The release of VEGF and PDGF-AA by the embryos may indicate that the beneficial effect of EV-endMSCs could be mediating not only an increase in the blastocyst’s total cell number, but also may promote endometrial angiogenesis, vascularization, differentiation and tissue remodeling. In summary, these results could be relevant for assisted reproduction being the first report describing the beneficial effect of human EV-endMSCs on embryo development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524517200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196080</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196080</link><unread>True</unread><title>Murine embryos exposed to human endometrial MSCs-derived extracellular vesicles exhibit higher VEGF/PDGF AA release, increased blastomere count and hatching rates</title><updated>1524517200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196080</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb94:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196080</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebeca Blázquez, Francisco Miguel Sánchez-Margallo, Verónica Álvarez, Elvira Matilla, Nuria Hernández, Federica Marinaro, María Gómez-Serrano, Inmaculada Jorge, Javier G.

Non-contact heart rate (HR) measurement from facial videos has attracted high interests due to its convenience and cost effectiveness. However, accurate and robust HR estimation under various realistic scenarios remain a very challenging problem. In this paper, we develop a novel system which can achieve a robust and accurate HR estimation under those challenging scenarios. First, to minimize tracking-artifacts arising from large head motions and facial expressions, we propose a joint face detection and alignment method which can produce alignment-friendly facial bounding boxes with reliable initial facial shapes, facilitating accurate and robust face alignment even in the presence of large pose variations and expressions. Second, different from most existing methods [1–5] which derive pulse signals from predetermined grid cells (i.e. local patches), our patches are varying-sized triangles generated adaptively to exclude negative effects from non-rigid facial motions. Third, we propose an adaptive patch selection method to choose patches which contain skin regions and are more likely to contain useful information, followed by an independent component analysis, for an accurate HR estimate. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our own dataset demonstrated that, comparing with the state-of-the-art methods [1–3], our method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by a large margin, ranging from 12% to 63%, and can provide a robust and accurate estimation under various challenging scenarios.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197275</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197275</link><unread>True</unread><title>Accurate face alignment and adaptive patch selection for heart rate estimation from videos under realistic scenarios</title><updated>1526072400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197275</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7e:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197275</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhiwei Wang, Xin Yang, Kwang-Ting Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our own dataset demonstrated that, comparing with the state-of-the-art methods [1–3], our method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by a large margin, ranging from 12% to 63%, and can provide a robust and accurate estimation under various challenging scenarios.</description><fingerprint>75282d5e</fingerprint><author><name>Zhiwei Wang</name></author><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><published>1525752000000</published><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02725/20180508/images/medium/jp-2018-02725y_0004.gif</url><width>452</width><height>500</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02725/20180508/images/medium/jp-2018-02725y_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02725&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To synthesise results of population surveys assessing knowledge and attitudes about prevention and treatment of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and grey literature were searched for English language entries published between 2012 and May 2017. Survey questions were grouped using an inductive approach and responses were pooled.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-four eligible studies and four grey literature items were identified. Surveys were conducted in Europe, the US, Eastern Asia, Israel, and Australia. Nearly half of respondents agreed that dementia is a normal and non-preventable part of ageing, but belief in the potential for prevention may be improving over time. The role of cardiovascular risk factors was poorly understood overall. Less than half of respondents reported belief in the availability of a cure for dementia. The value of seeking treatment was highly endorsed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Results suggest that knowledge about the potential for dementia prevention and treatment remains poor but may be improving over time.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To synthesise results of population surveys assessing knowledge and attitudes about prevention and treatment of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and grey literature were searched for English language entries published between 2012 and May 2017. Survey questions were grouped using an inductive approach and responses were pooled.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-four eligible studies and four grey literature items were identified. Surveys were conducted in Europe, the US, Eastern Asia, Israel, and Australia. Nearly half of respondents agreed that dementia is a normal and non-preventable part of ageing, but belief in the potential for prevention may be improving over time. The role of cardiovascular risk factors was poorly understood overall. Less than half of respondents reported belief in the availability of a cure for dementia. The value of seeking treatment was highly endorsed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Results suggest that knowledge about the potential for dementia prevention and treatment remains poor but may be improving over time. Knowledge among those living in low- and middle-income countries are largely unknown, presenting challenges for the development of National action plans consistent with World Health Organization directives.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>aac7ace8</fingerprint><author><name>Monica Cations</name></author><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05123-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;International research collaborations could end in wake of US president Donald Trump&apos;s decision.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525849200000</published><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05123-y/d41586-018-05123-y_15745592.jpg</url><width>1024</width><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y</link><unread>True</unread><title>How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y</originId><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16342ae7a90:76444d:3dd877af</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05123-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;International research collaborations could end in wake of US president Donald Trump&apos;s decision.</description><engagementRate>0.23</engagementRate><fingerprint>db70005c</fingerprint><author><name>Jeff Tollefson</name></author><crawled>1525832120976</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>44</engagement></item><item><content><content>Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, with more persons dying from nicotine addiction than any other preventable cause of death.

Recent studies have concluded that native and invasive species share a common set of trait relationships. However, native species in isolated regions might be functionally constrained by their unique evolutionary histories such that they follow different carbon capture strategies than introduced species. We compared leaf traits relating to resource investment, carbon return, and resource-use efficiency in 16 native (endemic) and three non-native (invasive) species in a temperate forest in Canterbury, South Island, New Zealand. Trait differences were more closely associated with leaf habit than nativity. Deciduous species (including invaders) exhibited greater maximum photosynthetic rates at similar resource costs, which resulted in greater nitrogen- and energy-use efficiencies than evergreen natives. Leaf area was the only trait that differed significantly by nativity (over two-fold larger in invaders). Invaders and deciduous natives both occupied the ‘fast return’ end of the leaf economics spectrum in contrast to the native evergreens which had comparatively slow return on investment. Dominant woody invaders in this forest are physiologically distinct from many New Zealand endemic species, which are overwhelmingly evergreen. It remains unclear whether these trait differences translate to an ecological divergence in plant strategy, but these results suggest that ecophysiological tradeoffs are likely constrained by biogeography.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196746</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196746</link><unread>True</unread><title>Are endemics functionally distinct?

In this process, white adipose tissue acquires thermogenic characteristics through the recruitment of so-called beige adipocytes. We investigated the downstream signaling pathways impinging on adipocyte progenitors that promote de novo formation of adipocytes. We showed that the Jak family of kinases controlled TGFβ signaling in the adipose tissue microenvironment through Stat3 and thereby adipogenic commitment, a function that was required for beige adipocyte differentiation of murine and human progenitors. Jak/Stat3 inhibited TGFβ signaling to the transcription factors Srf and Smad3 by repressing local &lt;i&gt;Tgfb3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tgfb1&lt;/i&gt; expression before the core transcriptional adipogenic cascade was activated. This pathway cross-talk was triggered in stromal cells by ATGL-dependent adipocyte lipolysis and a transient wave of IL-6 family cytokines at the onset of adipose tissue remodeling induced by β3-adrenergic receptor stimulation.

We investigated the downstream signaling pathways impinging on adipocyte progenitors that promote de novo formation of adipocytes. We showed that the Jak family of kinases controlled TGFβ signaling in the adipose tissue microenvironment through Stat3 and thereby adipogenic commitment, a function that was required for beige adipocyte differentiation of murine and human progenitors. Jak/Stat3 inhibited TGFβ signaling to the transcription factors Srf and Smad3 by repressing local &lt;i&gt;Tgfb3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tgfb1&lt;/i&gt; expression before the core transcriptional adipogenic cascade was activated. This pathway cross-talk was triggered in stromal cells by ATGL-dependent adipocyte lipolysis and a transient wave of IL-6 family cytokines at the onset of adipose tissue remodeling induced by β3-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Our results provide insight into the activation of adipocyte progenitors and are relevant for the therapeutic targeting of adipose tissue inflammatory pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>5c03746</fingerprint><author><name>Babaei, R., Schuster, M., Meln, I., Lerch, S., Ghandour, R.

Overconfidence has been reported to be a common bias among entrepreneurs and might be one cause of the high failure rates observed for new ventures. In this study, we investigate the overconfidence bias in a sample of 92 Austrian entrepreneurs, who responded to a general-knowledge questionnaire. Their levels of overconfidence were assessed by their responses to hard, medium and easy knowledge questions, and the relations of individual, organizational and environmental factors to the bias score were analyzed. The results confirmed that entrepreneurs are indeed prone to expressing overprecision, a type of overconfidence, but not when answering questions of all levels of difficulty. Being a single founder instead of a co-founder was identified as a significant predictor of overconfidence. Confidence, on the other hand, was associated with age and prior entrepreneurial experience, while accuracy was determined solely by age. The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</link><unread>True</unread><title>“Yes, we know!” (Over)confidence in general knowledge among Austrian entrepreneurs</title><updated>1525813200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506b:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viktorija Ilieva, Thomas Brudermann, Ljubomir Drakulevski&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (BVS) were introduced to overcome some of the limitations of drug-eluting stent (DES) for PCI. Data regarding the clinical outcomes of the BVS versus DES beyond 2 years are emerging.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To study mid-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We searched online databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, CENTRAL), several websites, meeting presentations and scientific session abstracts until August 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2017 for studies comparing Absorb BVS with second-generation DES. The primary outcome was target lesion failure (TLF). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR) and definite/probable device thrombosis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using a random effects model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ten studies, seven randomized controlled trials and three propensity-matched observational studies, with a total of 7320 patients (BVS n = 4007; DES n = 3313) and a median follow-up duration of 30.5 months, were included. Risk of TLF was increased for BVS-treated patients (OR 1.34 [95% CI: 1.12–1.60], p = 0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). This was also the case for all myocardial infarction (1.58 [95% CI: 1.27–1.96], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), TLR (1.48 [95% CI: 1.19–1.85], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%) and definite/probable device thrombosis (of 2.82 (95% CI: 1.86–3.89], p&amp;lt;0.001 and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 40.3%). This did not result in a difference in all-cause mortality (0.78 [95% CI: 0.58–1.04], p = 0.09, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). OR for very late (&gt;1 year) device thrombosis was 6.10 [95% CI: 1.40–26.65], p = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;At mid-term follow-up, BVS was associated with an increased risk of TLF, MI, TLR and definite/probable device thrombosis, but this did not result in an increased risk of all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197119</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197119</link><unread>True</unread><title>Mid-term outcomes of the Absorb BVS versus second-generation DES: A systematic review and meta-analysis</title><updated>1525899600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197119</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee3:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197119</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cordula M.

Characterising the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogens &lt;i&gt;in natura&lt;/i&gt; is key to ensuring their efficient prevention and control. However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate dispersal parameters at scales that are relevant to real epidemics. Epidemiological surveys can provide informative data, but parameter estimation can be hampered when the timing of the epidemiological events is uncertain, and in the presence of interactions between disease spread, surveillance, and control. Further complications arise from imperfect detection of disease and from the huge number of data on individual hosts arising from landscape-level surveys. Here, we present a Bayesian framework that overcomes these barriers by integrating over associated uncertainties in a model explicitly combining the processes of disease dispersal, surveillance and control. Using a novel computationally efficient approach to account for patch geometry, we demonstrate that disease dispersal distances can be estimated accurately in a patchy (i.e. fragmented) landscape when disease control is ongoing. Applying this model to data for an aphid-borne virus (&lt;i&gt;Plum pox virus&lt;/i&gt;) surveyed for 15 years in 605 orchards, we obtain the first estimate of the distribution of flight distances of infectious aphids at the landscape scale. About 50% of aphid flights terminate beyond 90 m, which implies that most infectious aphids leaving a tree land outside the bounds of a 1-ha orchard. Moreover, long-distance flights are not rare–10% of flights exceed 1 km. By their impact on our quantitative understanding of winged aphid dispersal, these results can inform the design of management strategies for plant viruses, which are mainly aphid-borne.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6RNe0Vdqjuk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525122000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006085</link><recrawled>1525110130225</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Estimation of the dispersal distances of an aphid-borne virus in a patchy landscape</title><updated>1525122000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006085</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006085</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16317a3def5:127149:ed160cc3</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/6RNe0Vdqjuk/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by David R.

The present study investigated the interplay between selective inhibition (the ability to suppress specific competing responses) and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any inappropriate response) during single word production. To this end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task. Selective inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to name target pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words. Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250 ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures with semantically related distractors than with unrelated distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a common inhibitory mechanism during different stages of the speech production process.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</link><unread>True</unread><title>The interplay between selective and nonselective inhibition during single word production</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ea:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ruben D.

Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250 ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures with semantically related distractors than with unrelated distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a common inhibitory mechanism during different stages of the speech production process.</description><fingerprint>619de92</fingerprint><author><name>Ruben D.

Background &lt;p&gt;While links between disability and poverty are well established, there have been few longitudinal studies to clarify direction of causality, particularly among older adults in low and middle income countries. We aimed to study the effect of care dependence among older adult residents on the economic functioning of their households, in catchment area survey sites in Peru, Mexico and China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Households were classified from the evolution of the needs for care of older residents, over two previous community surveys, as ‘incident care’, ‘chronic care’ or ‘no care’, and followed up three years later to ascertain economic outcomes (household income, consumption, economic strain, satisfaction with economic circumstances, healthcare expenditure and residents giving up work or education to care).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Household income did not differ between household groups. However, income from paid work (Pooled Count Ratio pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–1.00) and government transfers (pCR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69–0.93) were lower in care households. Consumption was 12% lower in chronic care households (pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99). Household healthcare expenditure was higher (pCR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26–1.90), and catastrophic healthcare spending more common (pRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.64–2.22) in care households.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While endogeneity cannot be confidently excluded as an explanation for the findings, this study indicates that older people’s needs for care have a discernable impact on household economics, controlling for baseline indicators of long-term economic status. Although living, typically, in multigenerational family units, older people have not featured prominently in global health and development agendas. Population ageing will rapidly increase the number of households where older people live, and their societal significance.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of deer, elk, moose, and reindeer (cervids) caused by misfolded prion proteins. The disease has been reported across North America and recently discovered in northern Europe. Transmission of CWD in wild cervid populations can occur through environmental routes, but limited ability to detect prions in environmental samples has prevented the identification of potential transmission “hot spots”. We establish widespread CWD prion contamination of mineral licks used by free-ranging cervids in an enzootic area in Wisconsin, USA. We show mineral licks can serve as reservoirs of CWD prions and thus facilitate disease transmission.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of deer, elk, moose, and reindeer (cervids) caused by misfolded prion proteins. The disease has been reported across North America and recently discovered in northern Europe. Transmission of CWD in wild cervid populations can occur through environmental routes, but limited ability to detect prions in environmental samples has prevented the identification of potential transmission “hot spots”. We establish widespread CWD prion contamination of mineral licks used by free-ranging cervids in an enzootic area in Wisconsin, USA. We show mineral licks can serve as reservoirs of CWD prions and thus facilitate disease transmission. Furthermore, mineral licks attract livestock and other wildlife that also obtain mineral nutrients via soil and water consumption. Exposure to CWD prions at mineral licks provides potential for cross-species transmission to wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Managing deer use of mineral licks warrants further consideration to help control outbreaks of CWD.</description><fingerprint>9e9d0d52</fingerprint><author><name>Ian H.

Currently, nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) with short pulse duration and non-thermal effects have various potential applications in medicine and biology, especially in tumor ablation. Additionally, there are a few investigations on its proliferative effects in the normal cell. Clinically, proliferation of endothelial cells can perhaps accelerate the stent endothelialization and reduce the risk of acute thrombosis. To explore the feasibility using nsPEFs to induce proliferation of endothelial cells, in this study, porcine iliac endothelial (PIEC) cell line was cultured and tested by CCK-8 assay after nsPEFs treatment. The results reflected that nsPEFs with low field strength (100ns, 5 kV/cm, 10 pulses) had a significant proliferative effect with an increase in the PIEC cell growth of 16% after a 48 hour’ post-treatment. To further understand the mechanism of cell proliferation, intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration was measured through fluo-4 AM and reactive oxygen species assay was applied to estimate the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the total nitric oxide assay for NO production in the cultured medium was evaluated. An enhanced concentration of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and ROS were observed, while the concentration of extracellular NO also increased after nsPEFs treatment. Such experimental results demonstrated that nsPEFs with appropriate pulse parameters could effectively enhance cell proliferation on PIEC cells, and the cell proliferation associated strongly with the changes of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concertation, ROS and NO production induced by nsPEFs treatment.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The appropriate use of clinically accurate diagnostic tests is essential for the detection of pertussis, a poorly controlled vaccine-preventable disease. The purpose of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic criteria including culture, multi-target polymerase chain reaction (PCR), anti-pertussis toxin IgG (IgG-PT) serology, and the use of a clinical case definition. An additional objective was to describe the optimal timing of specimen collection for the various tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Clinical specimens were collected from patients with cough illness at seven locations across the United States between 2007 and 2011. Nasopharyngeal and blood specimens were collected from each patient during the enrollment visit. Patients who had been coughing for ≤ 2 weeks were asked to return in 2–4 weeks for collection of a second, convalescent blood specimen. Sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic test were estimated using three methods—pertussis culture as the “gold standard,” composite reference standard analysis (CRS), and latent class analysis (LCA).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 868 patients were enrolled and 13.6% were &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pertussis&lt;/i&gt; positive by at least one diagnostic test. In a sample of 545 participants with non-missing data on all four diagnostic criteria, culture was 64.0% sensitive, PCR was 90.6% sensitive, and both were 100% specific by LCA. CRS and LCA methods increased the sensitivity estimates for convalescent serology and the clinical case definition over the culture-based estimates. Culture and PCR were most sensitive when performed during the first two weeks of cough; serology was optimally sensitive after the second week of cough.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Timing of specimen collection in relation to onset of illness should be considered when ordering diagnostic tests for pertussis.

Long reads, which are nowadays cheaper to produce and more widely available than ever before, have been used to reduce the fragmentation of the assembled haplotypes since their ability to span several variants along the genome. These long reads are also characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long reads deal only with limited coverages. Results: Here, we propose a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method to significantly reduce the required computational resources, allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool, HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up to 60x coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower runtimes. Conclusions: Our method leverages the long-range information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.

These long reads are also characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long reads deal only with limited coverages. Results: Here, we propose a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method to significantly reduce the required computational resources, allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool, HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up to 60x coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower runtimes. Conclusions: Our method leverages the long-range information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is considered a major worldwide health burden, with high mortality and associated costs. Health indicators are essential to define strategies to improve the treatment of diseases, and the epidemiology information of sepsis in developing countries is scarce. Thus, the aim of this work is to assess trends in the incidence, lethality, costs, and other indicators of sepsis for Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS—&lt;i&gt;Sistema Único de Saúde&lt;/i&gt;) hospitalizations for the period from January 2006 to December 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted this study using data from the SUS hospital information system. We selected registries of SUS hospitalizations of patients diagnosed with sepsis (total of 724,458 cases from 4,271 public and private Brazilian hospitals).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2015, the annual sepsis incidence increased 50.5% from 31.5/100,000 to 47.4/100,000 persons. The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 9.0 days. A total of 29.1% of the hospitalizations had admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a mean ICU LOS of 8.0 days. The mean cost per hospitalization was US$624.0 and for hospitalizations requiring intensive care was U$1,708.1. The overall sepsis lethality rate was 46.3%, and for hospitalizations with admission to the ICU, it was 64.5%. During the study period, the lethality rate for children/teenagers decreased 40.1%, but for all other age groups it increased 11.4%. The sepsis lethality rate in public hospitals (55.5%) was higher than private hospitals (37.0%) (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The mean hospitalization LOS for public hospitals (10.3 days) was higher than private hospitals (7.6 days) (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The incidence and lethality rate of sepsis increased in SUS hospitalizations during the study period.

According to cathepsin B hypothesis, mutated CTSB can lead to premature intracellular activation of trypsinogen, which is a key regulatory mechanism in pancreatitis. So far, CTSB mutations have been studied in pancreatitis and neurodegenerative disorders but little is known about the structural and functional effect of variants in CTSB. In this study, we investigated the effect of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with TCP, using molecular dynamics and simulation algorithms. There were two non-synonymous variants in the coding region (L26V and S53G) of CTSB, located in the propeptide region. We tried to predict the effect of these variants on structure and function using multiple algorithms: SIFT, Polyphen2, Panther, SDM sever, i-Mutant2.0 suite, mCSM algorithm and Vadar. Further, using databases like miRdbSNP, PolymiRTS and miRNASNP, two SNPs in 3-UTR region were predicted to affect the miRNA binding sites. Structural mutated models of nsSNP mutants (L26V and S53G) were prepared by MODELLER v9.15 and evaluated using TM-Align, Verify 3D, ProSA and Ramachandran plot. The results showed that the models (L26V and S53G) were of high accuracy. The 3D mutated structures were simulated using GROMACS 5.0 to predict the impact of these SNPs on protein stability. The results from in silico analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that these variants in the propeptide region of cathepsin B could lead to structural and functional changes in the protein. Hence, the structural and functional analysis results have given interim conclusions that these variants can have deleterious effect in TCP and thus should be screen in samples from all TCP patients to decipher its distribution in patient population.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524726000000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308932v1?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><title>Structural, functional and molecular dynamics analysis of cathepsin B gene SNPs associated with tropical calcific pancreatitis, a rare disease of tropics.

Further, using databases like miRdbSNP, PolymiRTS and miRNASNP, two SNPs in 3-UTR region were predicted to affect the miRNA binding sites. Structural mutated models of nsSNP mutants (L26V and S53G) were prepared by MODELLER v9.15 and evaluated using TM-Align, Verify 3D, ProSA and Ramachandran plot. The results showed that the models (L26V and S53G) were of high accuracy. The 3D mutated structures were simulated using GROMACS 5.0 to predict the impact of these SNPs on protein stability. The results from in silico analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that these variants in the propeptide region of cathepsin B could lead to structural and functional changes in the protein. Hence, the structural and functional analysis results have given interim conclusions that these variants can have deleterious effect in TCP and thus should be screen in samples from all TCP patients to decipher its distribution in patient population.</description><fingerprint>2bfd0f77</fingerprint><author><name>Singh, G.</name></author><crawled>1524758294619</crawled><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308932v1?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chew Weng Cheng, Chaturong Putaporntip, Somchai Jongwutiwes&lt;/p&gt;
Merozoite surface protein 7 (MSP-7) is a multigene family expressed during malaria blood-stage infection. MSP-7 forms complex with MSP-1 prior to merozoite egress from erythrocytes, and could affect merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. To characterize sequence variation in the orthologue in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; (PvMSP-7), a gene member encoding PvMSP-7E was analyzed among 92 Thai isolates collected from 3 major endemic areas of Thailand (Northwest: Tak, Northeast: Ubon Ratchathani, and South: Yala and Narathiwat provinces). In total, 52 distinct haplotypes were found to circulate in these areas. Although population structure based on this locus was observed between each endemic area, no genetic differentiation occurred between populations collected from different periods in the same endemic area, suggesting spatial but not temporal genetic variation. Sequence microheterogeneity in both N- and C- terminal regions was predicted to display 4 and 6 α-helical domains, respectively. Signals of purifying selection were observed in α-helices II-X, suggesting structural or functional constraint in these domains. By contrast, α-helix-I spanning the putative signal peptide was under positive selection, in which amino acid substitutions could alter predicted CD4+ T helper cell epitopes. The central region of &lt;i&gt;PvMSP-7E&lt;/i&gt; comprised the 5’-trimorphic and the 3’-dimorphic subregions. Positive selection was identified in the 3’ dimorphic subregion of the central domain. A consensus of intrinsically unstructured or disordered protein was predicted to encompass the entire central domain that contained a number of putative B cell epitopes and putative protein binding regions. Evidences of intragenic recombination were more common in the central region than the remainders of the gene. These results suggest that the extent of sequence variation, recombination events and selective pressures in the &lt;i&gt;PvMSP-7E&lt;/i&gt; locus seem to be differentially affected by protein secondary structure.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196765</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196765</link><unread>True</unread><title>Polymorphism in merozoite surface protein-7E of &amp;lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&amp;lt;/i&gt; in Thailand: Natural selection related to protein secondary structure</title><updated>1525294800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196765</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a18e:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196765</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chew Weng Cheng, Chaturong Putaporntip, Somchai Jongwutiwes&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;To highlight the differences in macular pigment optical density (MPOD) between eyes with vitreoretinal interface syndrome and healthy control eyes, to assess the changes in MPOD in eyes treated with macular peeling, to investigate the relationships between MPOD changes and measures of retinal sensitivity such as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and microperimetry.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional comparative study, 30 eyes affected by idiopathic epiretinal membrane (iERM, 15eyes) or full-thickness macular hole (FTMH, 15eyes) were compared with 60 eyes from 30 healthy age-matched patients. MPOD values (mean MPOD, maximum MPOD, MPOD area, and MPOD volume) were measured in a range of 4°–7° of eccentricity around the fovea, using the one-wavelength reflectometry method (Visucam 200, Carl-Zeiss Meditec). Patients affected by iERM and FTMH were treated with vitrectomy and epiretinal membrane-inner limiting membrane (ERM-ILM) peeling, with follow-up examinations performed preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. The main outcome measures were the differences in MPOD between eyes with vitreoretinal interface syndrome and healthy eyes, changes in MPOD after ERM-ILM peeling, and relationships between MPOD and functional changes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean MPOD differed significantly between control eyes and those with iERM (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .0001) or FTMH (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .0006). The max MPOD and MPOD area increased, but not significantly. After peeling, the only significant change in MPOD was in MPOD volume (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .01). In the ERM group, postoperative mean MPOD correlated significantly with best-corrected visual acuity (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = .739, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .002).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MPOD was reduced in patients with iERM or FTMH compared with healthy eyes. We found a significant correlation between the mean postoperative MPOD and postoperative BCVA, hypothesizing that the postoperative increase in mean MPOD could be due to a change in distribution for unfolding and expansion of the fovea after the peeling.

HIV acquisition during pregnancy and breastfeeding significantly contributes toward paediatric HIV infection; however, little is known about risk behaviours in HIV-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted twenty-six in-depth-interviews between July and December 2016 using a semi-structured interview guide among HIV-uninfected pregnant and recently postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition (defined as reporting ≥1 of the following: partner’s serostatus unknown or HIV-infected, recent condomless sex in pregnancy, and/or alcohol use during pregnancy) who attended primary healthcare services. Our study contextualizes factors related to risky sexual behaviours during pregnancy and postpartum periods and assesses knowledge and hypothetical acceptability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnancy. Translated and transcribed data were coded and analysed by three researchers using a thematic analysis approach. In interviews with HIV-uninfected pregnant/postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition, we identified common themes associated with sexual risk behaviours during pregnancy, including: lack of control over decisions in sex and condom use in pregnancy, low perceived risk (e.g. beliefs that their partner has the same HIV-negative serostatus), and socio-cultural beliefs around condom use during pregnancy (e.g. contact with sperm is essential for baby’s development). PrEP knowledge was low among HIV-uninfected pregnant and breastfeeding women, and potential acceptability was good, though primary concerns were around the potential impact on the infant. While mothers presented a clear desire to protect themselves from HIV acquisition once pregnant, they also reported lack of control, and socio-cultural beliefs, like sex is good for the baby, that increased their risk of seroconversion. Mothers had limited PrEP awareness but reported hypothetical willingness to use PrEP because of concerns over HIV acquisition and onward mother to child transmission.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526331600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197143</link><unread>True</unread><title>Risk perception and sex behaviour in pregnancy and breastfeeding in high HIV prevalence settings: Programmatic implications for PrEP delivery</title><updated>1526331600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197143</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd5:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197143</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dvora Joseph Davey, Elise Farley, Catriona Towriss, Yolanda Gomba, Linda-Gail Bekker, Pamina Gorbach, Steven Shoptaw, Thomas Coates, Landon Myer&lt;/p&gt;

Disease tolerance is a defense strategy against infections that aims at maintaining host health even at high pathogen replication or load. Tolerance mechanisms are currently intensively studied with the long-term goal of exploiting them therapeutically. Because tolerance-based treatment imposes less selective pressure on the pathogen it has been hypothesised to be “evolution-proof”. However, the primary public health goal is to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with a disease. From this perspective, tolerance-based treatment bears the risk of increasing the prevalence of the disease, which may lead to increased mortality. We assessed the promise of tolerance-based treatment strategies using mathematical models. Conventional treatment was implemented as an increased recovery rate, while tolerance-based treatment was assumed to reduce the disease-related mortality of infected hosts without affecting recovery. We investigated the endemic phase of two types of infections: acute and chronic. Additionally, we considered the effect of pathogen resistance against conventional treatment. We show that, for low coverage of tolerance-based treatment, chronic infections can cause even more deaths than without treatment. Overall, we found that conventional treatment always outperforms tolerance-based treatment, even when we allow the emergence of pathogen resistance. Our results cast doubt on the potential benefit of tolerance-based over conventional treatment. Any clinical application of tolerance-based treatment of infectious diseases has to consider the associated detrimental epidemiological feedback.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C5jRnX8QuMo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525467600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006119</link><recrawled>1525455726414</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Assessing the public health impact of tolerance-based therapies with mathematical models</title><updated>1525467600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006119</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006119</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1632c3ea1f7:66cd1:ed160cc3</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/C5jRnX8QuMo/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathanaël Hozé, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Roland Regoes&lt;/p&gt;

The vertebrate neuroepithelium is composed of elongated progenitors whose reciprocal attachments ensure the continuity of the ventricular wall. As progenitors commit to differentiation, they translocate their nucleus basally and eventually withdraw their apical endfoot from the ventricular surface. However, the mechanisms allowing this delamination process to take place while preserving the integrity of the neuroepithelial tissue are still unclear. Here, we show that Notch signaling, which is classically associated with an undifferentiated state, remains active in prospective neurons until they delaminate. During this transition period, prospective neurons rapidly reduce their apical surface and only later down-regulate N-Cadherin levels. Upon Notch blockade, nascent neurons disassemble their junctions but fail to reduce their apical surface. This disrupted sequence weakens the junctional network and eventually leads to breaches in the ventricular wall. We also provide evidence that the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) promotes differentiation by reducing Notch signaling through a &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition mechanism. However, during the delamination process, the ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1) transiently blocks this &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition and sustains Notch activity to defer differentiation. We propose that the fine-tuned balance between Notch &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-activation and &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition allows neuroepithelial cells to seamlessly delaminate from the ventricular wall as they commit to differentiation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OBYDT1hFD-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525122000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004162</link><recrawled>1525113004990</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Mib1 prevents Notch &amp;lt;i&gt;Cis&amp;lt;/i&gt;-inhibition to defer differentiation and preserve neuroepithelial integrity during neural delamination</title><updated>1525122000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004162</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004162</originId><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16317b82452:13eb348:a96d255</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/OBYDT1hFD-8/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chooyoung Baek, Lucy Freem, Rosette Goïame, Helen Sang, Xavier Morin, Samuel Tozer&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the existence of the prophylactic Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, infection by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb) remains a major public health issue causing up to 1.8 million annual deaths worldwide. Increasing prevalence of Mtb strains resistant to antibiotics represents an urgent threat for global health that has prompted a search for alternative treatment regimens not subject to development of resistance. Immunotherapy constitutes a promising approach to improving current antibiotic treatments through engagement of the host’s immune system. We designed a multi-antigenic and multiphasic vaccine, based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus, denoted MVATG18598, which expresses ten antigens classically described as representative of each of different phases of Mtb infection. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; analysis coupled with multiple-passage evaluation demonstrated that this vaccine is genetically stable, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. fit for manufacturing. Using different mouse strains, we show that MVATG18598 vaccination results in both Th1-associated T-cell responses and cytolytic activity, targeting all 10 vaccine-expressed Mtb antigens. In chronic post-exposure mouse models, MVATG18598 vaccination in combination with an antibiotic regimen decreases the bacterial burden in the lungs of infected mice, compared with chemotherapy alone, and is associated with long-lasting antigen-specific Th1-type T cell and antibody responses. In one model, co-treatment with MVATG18598 prevented relapse of the disease after treatment completion, an important clinical goal. Overall, results demonstrate the capacity of the therapeutic MVATG18598 vaccine to improve efficacy of chemotherapy against TB. These data support further development of this novel immunotherapeutic in the treatment of Mtb infections.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196815</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196815</link><unread>True</unread><title>A multi-antigenic MVA vaccine increases efficacy of combination chemotherapy against &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><updated>1525294800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196815</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a193:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196815</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stéphane Leung-Theung-Long, Charles-Antoine Coupet, Marie Gouanvic, Doris Schmitt, Aurélie Ray, Chantal Hoffmann, Huguette Schultz, Sandeep Tyagi, Heena Soni, Paul J.

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape. We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</link><unread>True</unread><title>Functional clustering of mouse ultrasonic vocalization data</title><updated>1525899600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed1:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoling Dou, Shingo Shirahata, Hiroki Sugimoto&lt;/p&gt;

Viruses and bacteria are critical components of the human microbiome and play important roles in health and disease. Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and viruses independently, thereby reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that maintain community robustness or allow phage-host populations to co-evolve. We implemented a network-based analytical approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We built these community networks using a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given microbiome. Our algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We observed evidence that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets appeared to be associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and likely more susceptible to network degradation by microbial extinction events. This study quantified and contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as disease states, through ecological networks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_YNV8fo1dhc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524085200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006099</link><recrawled>1524084125569</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Biogeography and environmental conditions shape bacteriophage-bacteria networks across the human microbiome</title><updated>1524085200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006099</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006099</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162d9eb5eb9:b6eef:a077e55f</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/_YNV8fo1dhc/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Geoffrey D.

We suggest that TcRα utilizes SHM to broaden diversification of the primary αβ T cell repertoire in sharks, the first reported use in vertebrates.</description><fingerprint>b95e700</fingerprint><keywords><item>Immunology and Inflammation</item></keywords><author><name>MCRISCITIELLO@CVM.TAMU.EDU (Caitlin D Castro)</name></author><crawled>1523966659118</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>59</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Facial bone fragmentation in blind cavefish arises through two unusual ossification processes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facial bone fragmentation in blind cavefish arises through two unusual ossification processes, Published online: 03 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25107-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25107-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Facial bone fragmentation in blind cavefish arises through two unusual ossification processes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/qOwhhkWAjVk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525330800000</published><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25107-2/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25107_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><height>556</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25107-2</link><unread>True</unread><title>Facial bone fragmentation in blind cavefish arises through two unusual ossification processes</title><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25107-2</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25107-2</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16325493de1:b8a36d:5785ab88</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/qOwhhkWAjVk/s41598-018-25107-2</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Facial bone fragmentation in blind cavefish arises through two unusual ossification processes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facial bone fragmentation in blind cavefish arises through two unusual ossification processes, Published online: 03 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25107-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25107-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Facial bone fragmentation in blind cavefish arises through two unusual ossification processes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/qOwhhkWAjVk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>134b109c</fingerprint><author><name>Amanda K.

The rise of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) techniques have sparked an increasing interest in the effects of weak extracellular electric fields on neural activity. These fields modulate ongoing neural activity through polarization of the neuronal membrane. While the somatic polarization has been investigated experimentally, the frequency-dependent polarization of the dendritic trees in the presence of alternating (AC) fields has received little attention yet. Using a biophysically detailed model with experimentally constrained active conductances, we analyze the subthreshold response of cortical pyramidal cells to weak AC fields, as induced during tCS. We observe a strong frequency resonance around 10-20 Hz in the apical dendrites sensitivity to polarize in response to electric fields but not in the basal dendrites nor the soma. To disentangle the relative roles of the cell morphology and active and passive membrane properties in this resonance, we perform a thorough analysis using simplified models, e.g. a passive pyramidal neuron model, simple passive cables and reconstructed cell model with simplified ion channels. We attribute the origin of the resonance in the apical dendrites to (i) a locally increased sensitivity due to the morphology and to (ii) the high density of h-type channels. Our systematic study provides an improved understanding of the subthreshold response of cortical cells to weak electric fields and, importantly, allows for an improved design of tCS stimuli.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J_BWXr6Snsg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525467600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006124</link><recrawled>1525455726414</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Differential polarization of cortical pyramidal neuron dendrites through weak extracellular fields</title><updated>1525467600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006124</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006124</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1632c3ea1f7:66cd2:ed160cc3</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/J_BWXr6Snsg/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Aspart, Michiel W.

Understanding the determinants of syntactic choice in sentence production is a salient topic in psycholinguistics. Existing evidence suggests that syntactic choice results from an interplay between linguistic and non-linguistic factors, and a speaker’s attention to the elements of a described event represents one such factor. Whereas multimodal accounts of attention suggest a role for different modalities in this process, existing studies examining attention effects in syntactic choice are primarily based on visual cueing paradigms. Hence, it remains unclear whether attentional effects on syntactic choice are limited to the visual modality or are indeed more general. This issue is addressed by the current study. Native English participants viewed and described line drawings of simple transitive events while their attention was directed to the location of the agent or the patient of the depicted event by means of either an &lt;i&gt;auditory&lt;/i&gt; (monaural beep) or a &lt;i&gt;motor&lt;/i&gt; (unilateral key press) lateral cue. Our results show an effect of cue location, with participants producing more passive-voice descriptions in the patient-cued conditions. Crucially, this cue location effect emerged in the motor-cue but not (or substantially less so) in the auditory-cue condition, as confirmed by a reliable interaction between &lt;i&gt;cue location&lt;/i&gt; (agent vs. patient) and &lt;i&gt;cue type&lt;/i&gt; (auditory vs. motor). Our data suggest that attentional effects on the speaker’s syntactic choices are modality-specific and limited to the visual and motor, but not the auditory, domain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523912400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195547</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195547</link><unread>True</unread><title>Motor (but not auditory) attention affects syntactic choice</title><updated>1523912400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195547</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ad7:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195547</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mikhail Pokhoday, Christoph Scheepers, Yury Shtyrov, Andriy Myachykov&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Estimating mortality risk during TB treatment in HIV co-infected patients is challenging for health professionals, especially in a low TB prevalence population, due to the lack of a standardized prognostic system. The current study aimed to develop and validate a simple mortality prognostic scoring system for TB/HIV co-infected patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from the CDC’s Tuberculosis Genotyping Information Management System of TB patients in Texas reported from 01/2010 through 12/2016, age ≥15 years, HIV(+), and outcome being “completed” or “died”, we developed and internally validated a mortality prognostic score using multiple logistic regression. Model discrimination was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The model’s good calibration was determined by a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow’s goodness of fit test.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 450 patients included in the analysis, 57 (12.7%) died during TB treatment. The final prognostic score used six characteristics (age, residence in long-term care facility, meningeal TB, chest x-ray, culture positive, and culture not converted/unknown), which are routinely collected by TB programs. Prognostic scores were categorized into three groups that predicted mortality: low-risk (&amp;lt;20 points), medium-risk (20–25 points) and high-risk (&gt;25 points). The model had good discrimination and calibration (AUC = 0.82; 0.80 in bootstrap validation), and a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow test p = 0.71.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our simple validated mortality prognostic scoring system can be a practical tool for health professionals in identifying TB/HIV co-infected patients with high mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523912400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196022</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196022</link><unread>True</unread><title>Prognostic score to predict mortality during TB treatment in TB/HIV co-infected patients</title><updated>1523912400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196022</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7af0:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196022</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Duc T.

Background &lt;p&gt;Governments have an ethical imperative to safeguard children in residential care institutions at all times, including in the aftermath of an emergency. Yet, a lack of accurate data about how the magnitude and characteristics of this population may change due to an emergency impedes leaders’ ability to formulate responsive policies and services, mobilize resources and foster accountability. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the feasibility of evaluating movement of children into residential care following an emergency.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The pilot study took place in Les Cayes commune in the Sud Department of Haiti in April 2017. Six months prior to the pilot, the area was severely affected by Hurricane Matthew, with widespread devastation to property, livestock and livelihoods. Using a two-stage process, the team created a comprehensive list of residential care institutions in Les Cayes. At each facility, the data collectors attempted to administer four separate tools: a group count tool, a record review tool, interviews with staff, and interviews with children 10 years of age and older.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 27 known institutions in Les Cayes, 22 institutions consented to participate in the research. Within these 22 institutions, the prevalence of new arrivals to residential care since Hurricane Matthew varied significantly across the four tools, ranging from 0.69% according to the aggregated child interviews to 20.96% according to the aggregated staff interviews. Record availability and quality was very poor and child participation was difficult to arrange due to travel and scheduling constraints.&lt;/p&gt; Interpretation &lt;p&gt;Robust measurement of new arrivals to residential care institutions was not feasible in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew. Moreover, many of the challenges encountered are likely to be encountered in humanitarian emergencies in other settings. Therefore, the research team does not recommend scale-up of these methods in most humanitarian settings. Alternative approaches that incorporate household survey methods to ascertain movement into residential care based on reports from caregivers may be more realistic in places with poor pre-existing governance systems and weak registries and records for residential care institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523912400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195515</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195515</link><unread>True</unread><title>Measuring movement into residential care institutions in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew: A pilot study</title><updated>1523912400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195515</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ad6:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195515</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beth L.

Increases of the activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain generally lead to increases of production of ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products. MnSOD is the first line of defense against the stress induced by mitochondrial ROS. Our previous studies demonstrated that EAE progression increased Na,K-ATPase activity in the mouse kidney cortex. Since mitochondria are the major source of ATP, our present studies were sought to determine whether EAE progression increased mitochondrial activity. We found that severe EAE increased mitochondrial complex II and IV activities without significantly affecting complex I activity with corresponding increases of ROS in the isolated mitochondria and native kidney cortex. Severe EAE augmented both cytosolic and mitochondrial MnSOD protein levels and activities and decreased the specific activity of mitochondrial MnSOD when the total mitochondrial MnSOD activity was normalized to the protein level. Using HEK293 cells as a model free of interference from immune reactions, we found that activation of Na,K-ATPase by monensin for 24 hours increased complex II activity, mitochondrial ROS and MnSOD protein abundance, and decreased the specific activity of the mitochondrial MnSOD. Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase by ouabain or catalase attenuated the effects of monensin on the mitochondrial complex II activity, ROS, MnSOD protein level and specific activity. Kockdown of MnSOD by RNAi reduced the mitochondrial ability to generate ATP. In conclusion, EAE increases mitochondrial activity possibly to meet the energy demand from increased Na,K-ATPase activity. EAE increases mitochondrial MnSOD protein abundance to compensate for the loss of the specific activity of the enzyme, thus minimizing the harmful effects of ROS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524603600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196277</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196277</link><unread>True</unread><title>Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) up-regulates the mitochondrial activity and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the mouse renal cortex</title><updated>1524603600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196277</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa5:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196277</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Balamurugan Packialakshmi, Xiaoming Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

The innate immune system is paramount in the response to and clearance of influenza A virus (IAV) infection in non-immune individuals. Known factors include type I and III interferons and antiviral pathogen recognition receptors, and the cascades of antiviral and pro- and anti-inflammatory gene expression they induce. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly recognized to participate in post-transcriptional modulation of these responses, but the temporal dynamics of how these players of the antiviral innate immune response collaborate to combat infection remain poorly characterized. We quantified the expression of miRNAs and protein coding genes in the lungs of pigs 1, 3, and 14 days after challenge with swine IAV (H1N2). Through RT-qPCR we observed a 400-fold relative increase in IFN-λ3 gene expression on day 1 after challenge, and a strong interferon-mediated antiviral response was observed on days 1 and 3 accompanied by up-regulation of genes related to the pro-inflammatory response and apoptosis. Using small RNA sequencing and qPCR validation we found 27 miRNAs that were differentially expressed after challenge, with the highest number of regulated miRNAs observed on day 3. In contrast, the number of protein coding genes found to be regulated due to IAV infection peaked on day 1. Pulmonary miRNAs may thus be aimed at fine-tuning the initial rapid inflammatory response after IAV infection.

The innate immune system is paramount in the response to and clearance of influenza A virus (IAV) infection in non-immune individuals. Known factors include type I and III interferons and antiviral pathogen recognition receptors, and the cascades of antiviral and pro- and anti-inflammatory gene expression they induce. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly recognized to participate in post-transcriptional modulation of these responses, but the temporal dynamics of how these players of the antiviral innate immune response collaborate to combat infection remain poorly characterized. We quantified the expression of miRNAs and protein coding genes in the lungs of pigs 1, 3, and 14 days after challenge with swine IAV (H1N2). Through RT-qPCR we observed a 400-fold relative increase in IFN-λ3 gene expression on day 1 after challenge, and a strong interferon-mediated antiviral response was observed on days 1 and 3 accompanied by up-regulation of genes related to the pro-inflammatory response and apoptosis. Using small RNA sequencing and qPCR validation we found 27 miRNAs that were differentially expressed after challenge, with the highest number of regulated miRNAs observed on day 3. In contrast, the number of protein coding genes found to be regulated due to IAV infection peaked on day 1. Pulmonary miRNAs may thus be aimed at fine-tuning the initial rapid inflammatory response after IAV infection. Specifically, we found five miRNAs (ssc-miR-15a, ssc-miR-18a, ssc-miR-21, ssc-miR-29b, and hsa-miR-590-3p)–four known porcine miRNAs and one novel porcine miRNA candidate–to be potential modulators of viral pathogen recognition and apoptosis. A total of 11 miRNAs remained differentially expressed 14 days after challenge, at which point the infection had cleared. In conclusion, the results suggested a role for miRNAs both during acute infection as well as later, with the potential to influence lung homeostasis and susceptibility to secondary infections in the lungs of pigs after IAV infection.</description><fingerprint>f37e882a</fingerprint><author><name>Louise Brogaard</name></author><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>The enterically transmitted hepatitis E virus (HEV) adopts a unique strategy to exit cells by cloaking its capsid (encoded by the viral ORF2 gene) and circulating in the blood as “quasi-enveloped” particles.

The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526072400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002912</link><recrawled>1526060763996</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Hey1- and p53-dependent TrkC proapoptotic activity controls neuroblastoma growth</title><updated>1526072400000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002912</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002912</originId><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f2:f3bf0074</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/k59-VYZP8r0/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Ménard, Clélia Costechareyre, Gabriel Ichim, Jonathan Blachier, David Neves, Loraine Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Reinhard Depping, Jan Koster, Pierre Saintigny, Patrick Mehlen, Servane Tauszig-Delamasure&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Polypharmacy is common in older patients but relationships between polypharmacy and common co-morbid conditions have not been elucidated. Our goal was to determine relationships between daily oral medication use and common co-morbid disease dyads and triads using comprehensive medication and diagnostic data from a national sample of nursing homes (NH).&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Retrospective, cross-sectional study.&lt;/p&gt; Setting &lt;p&gt;Nationally representative sample of U.S. Nursing Homes.&lt;/p&gt; Participants &lt;p&gt;Nationally representative sample of long-term stay residents (n = 11734, 75% women) aged 65 years or older.&lt;/p&gt; Measurements &lt;p&gt;Diagnosis and medication data were analyzed. Proportion of daily oral medication intake attributed to treatment of common two-(dyads) and three-disease (triad) combinations and “health maintenance” agents (vitamins, dietary supplements, stool softeners without related diagnoses) was determined.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Older NH residents received slightly &gt;8 oral medications/day with the number related to number of medical diagnoses (p &amp;lt; .0001). One third of chronic oral medication intake/day (excluding health maintenance agents) could be attributed to dyad combinations and about half to triad combinations despite an average of 5 other diagnoses. Triads were comprised of hypertension +/- arthritis +/- vascular disease, +/-depression, +/- osteoporosis +/- gastroesophageal reflux disease and +/- diabetes. Health maintenance agents accounted for 15–17% of daily oral medication intake (1.4 medications) such that almost two-thirds of daily oral medications were attributable to disease triads plus health maintenance. Fewer medications were prescribed for NH residents over age 85 (decreased ACE inhibitor and HMG CoA reductase inhibitor USE (p &amp;lt; .001)) while use of Alzheimer medications was higher (p &amp;lt; .01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A large fraction of daily oral medications were attributed to management of common co-morbid disease dyads and triads.

The relapse of nasal deformity is a challenge for modern correction of cleft lip. A comprehensive understanding in the biomechanical perspective of both the formation and correction of the cleft lip nasal deformity would lead to improved stability of the corrective outcome. In this study, a finite element model of secondary cleft lip nasal deformity was constructed, on which two critical corrective maneuvers were mimicked in the form of force-loading. The intercrural suture was simulated by a force loaded at the intermediate crus of the alar cartilage directing anteriorly and medially, and the suture suspending the alar cartilage to the upper lateral cartilage was simulated by a force loaded at the lateral crus directing superiorly and medially. The equivalent von-mises stress and the total deformation consequent to different patterns of loading were captured. Our biomechanical analyses suggested that the intercrural suture at the nasal tip might be more effective in generating widespread morphological change than the suspension suture, but left much higher level of stress within the skin envelope if placed too high. Synergistic effect was observed between the two sutures in both the resultant deformation and stress. In addition, our simulations were partially supported by clinical photogrammetry data.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523653200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195583</link><unread>False</unread><title>Mechanical analyses of critical surgical maneuvers in the correction of cleft lip nasal deformity</title><updated>1523653200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195583</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793628:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195583</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanyao Huang, Yeping Li, Xiangyou Luo, Xu Cheng, Bing Shi, Jingtao Li&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011–2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim. Bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to yield odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were a total of 612 IFH claims made in the ED from 2011–2013. The demographic characteristics, acuity of presentation and discharge diagnoses were similar during both the before and after periods. Overall, 28.6% fewer claims were made under the IFH program after the cuts. Of the claims made, significantly more were rejected after the cuts than before (13.7% after vs. 3.9% before, adjusted OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.18–8.40; p&amp;lt;0.05). The majority (75.0%) of rejected claims have not been paid by patients. Fewer patients after the cuts indicated that they had a family physician (20.4% after vs. 30% before, unadjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14–2.44; p&amp;lt;0.05) yet a higher proportion of patients without a family physician were still advised to follow up with their family doctor during the after period (67.2% after vs. 41.8% before, unadjusted OR 2.85, 95% CI: 1.45–5.62; p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of both rejected and subsequently unpaid claims after the IFH cuts in June 2012, as demonstrated in the logistic regression analysis in this health records review, represents a potential barrier to emergency medical care, as well as a new financial burden to be shouldered by patients and hospitals. A reduction in IFH claims in the ED and a reduction in the number of patients with access to a family physician also suggests inadequate primary care for this population, yet this was not reflected in the follow-up advice offered by ED physicians to patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197282</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197282</link><unread>True</unread><title>Use of the emergency department by refugees under the Interim Federal Health Program: A health records review</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197282</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0e8:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197282</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Francis Bakewell, Sarah Addleman, Garth Dickinson, Venkatesh Thiruganasambandamoorthy&lt;/p&gt;

The neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is pathologically characterized by the massive influx of immune cells into the central nervous system. This contributes to demyelination and axonal damage which causes symptoms such as motor and cognitive dysfunctions. The migration of leukocytes from the blood vessel is orchestrated by a multitude of factors whose determination is essential in reducing cellular influx in MS patients and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model. The here studied enzyme tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) is present intracellularly, on the cell surface and extracellularly. There it contributes to cellular adhesion and migration via its transamidation activity and possibly by facilitating cellular interaction with the extracellular matrix. Previous data from our group showed reduced motor symptoms and cellular infiltration after using a pharmacological TG2 transamidation activity inhibitor in a rat EAE model. However, it remained elusive if the cross-linking activity of the enzyme resulted in the observed effects. To follow-up, we now characterized two new small molecule TG2 activity inhibitors, BJJF078 and ERW1041E. Both compounds are potent inhibitor of recombinant human and mouse Transglutaminase enzyme activity, mainly TG2 and the close related enzyme TG1. In addition they did not affect the binding of TG2 to the extracellular matrix substrate fibronectin, a process via which TG2 promotes cellular adhesion and migration. We found, that ERW1041E but not BJJF078 resulted in reduced EAE disease motor-symptoms while neither caused apparent changes in pathology (cellular influx), Transglutaminase activity or expression of inflammation related markers in the spinal cord, compared to vehicle treated controls. Although we cannot exclude issues on bioavailability and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; efficacy of the used compounds, we hypothesize that extracellular TG1/TG2 activity is of greater importance than (intra-)cellular activity in mouse EAE pathology.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524603600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196433</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196433</link><unread>True</unread><title>Characterization of Transglutaminase 2 activity inhibitors in monocytes &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; and their effect in a mouse model for multiple sclerosis</title><updated>1524603600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196433</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb7:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196433</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Navina L.

Elevated temperature induces the heat shock (HS) response, which modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, the immune and inflammatory responses. However, specific mechanisms linking the HS response pathways to major cellular signaling systems are not fully understood. Here we used integrated computational and experimental approaches to quantitatively analyze the crosstalk mechanisms between the HS-response and a master regulator of inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis the Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) system. We found that populations of human osteosarcoma cells, exposed to a clinically relevant 43°C HS had an attenuated NF-κB p65 response to Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) treatment. The degree of inhibition of the NF-κB response depended on the HS exposure time. Mathematical modeling of single cells indicated that individual crosstalk mechanisms differentially encode HS-mediated NF-κB responses while being consistent with the observed population-level responses. In particular “all-or-nothing” encoding mechanisms were involved in the HS-dependent regulation of the IKK activity and IκBα phosphorylation, while others involving transport were “analogue”. In order to discriminate between these mechanisms, we used live-cell imaging of nuclear translocations of the NF-κB p65 subunit. The single cell responses exhibited “all-or-nothing” encoding. While most cells did not respond to TNFα stimulation after a 60 min HS, 27% showed responses similar to those not receiving HS. We further demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the predicted inhibition of IKK activity was consistent with the observed HS-dependent depletion of the IKKα and IKKβ subunits in whole cell lysates. However, a combination of “all-or-nothing” crosstalk mechanisms was required to completely recapitulate the single cell data. We postulate therefore that the heterogeneity of the single cell responses might be explained by the cell-intrinsic variability of HS-modulated IKK signaling. In summary, we show that high temperature modulates NF-κB responses in single cells in a complex and unintuitive manner, which needs to be considered in hyperthermia-based treatment strategies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SmfXbHv2meA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525122000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006130</link><recrawled>1525110130225</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Quantitative analysis reveals crosstalk mechanisms of heat shock-induced attenuation of NF-κB signaling at the single cell level</title><updated>1525122000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006130</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006130</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16317a3def5:12714c:ed160cc3</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/SmfXbHv2meA/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Kardyńska, Anna Paszek, Jarosław Śmieja, David Spiller, Wiesława Widłak, Michael R.

This study investigated &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; expression in the &lt;i&gt;pars tuberalis&lt;/i&gt; (PT) of the pituitary and medio-basal hypothalamus (MBH) of sheep, across seasons and reproductive states. It has recently been proposed that season impacts alternative splicing of &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in the PT, which shifts the balance between angiogenic VEGFAxxx and anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms (with xxx the number of amino acids of the mature VEGFA proteins) to modulate seasonal breeding. Here, we used various RT-PCR methodologies and analysis of RNAseq datasets to investigate seasonal variation in expression and splicing of the ovine &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; gene. Collectively, we identify 5 different transcripts for &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; within the ewe PT/MBH, which correspond to splicing events previously described in mouse and human.

We present genomic data from seven 15,000-year-old modern humans, attributed to the Iberomaurusian culture, from Morocco. We find a genetic affinity with early Holocene Near Easterners, best represented by Levantine Natufians, suggesting a pre-agricultural connection between Africa and the Near East.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of acupuncture, sham acupuncture and drugs in the treatment of chronic constipation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of acupuncture and drugs for chronic constipation were comprehensively retrieved from electronic databases (such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP Database and CBM) up to December 2017. Additional references were obtained from review articles. With quality evaluations and data extraction, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using a random-effects model under a frequentist framework. A total of 40 studies (n = 11032) were included: 39 were high-quality studies and 1 was a low-quality study. NMA showed that (1) acupuncture improved the symptoms of chronic constipation more effectively than drugs; (2) the ranking of treatments in terms of efficacy in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome was acupuncture, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, prucalopride, sham acupuncture, tegaserod, and placebo; (3) the ranking of side effects were as follows: lactulose, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol, prucalopride, linaclotide, placebo and tegaserod; and (4) the most commonly used acupuncture point for chronic constipation was ST25. Acupuncture is more effective than drugs in improving chronic constipation and has the least side effects. In the future, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to prove this. Sham acupuncture may have curative effects that are greater than the placebo effect. In the future, it is necessary to perform high-quality studies to support this finding. Polyethylene glycol also has acceptable curative effects with fewer side effects than other drugs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524690000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196128</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196128</link><unread>True</unread><title>Comparison of acupuncture and other drugs for chronic constipation: A network meta-analysis</title><updated>1524690000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196128</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b1:91749e5b</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196128</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lingping Zhu, Yunhui Ma, Xiaoyan Deng&lt;/p&gt;

CD32a expression was recently reported to mark CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells harboring a replication-competent HIV reservoir during antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppression. We aimed to determine whether CD32 expression marks HIV latently or transcriptionally active infected CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Using peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue of ART-treated HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects, we found that most of the circulating memory CD32&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells expressed markers of activation, including CD69, HLA-DR, CD25, CD38, and Ki67, and bore a T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 phenotype as defined by CXCR3, CCR4, and CCR6. CD32 expression did not selectively enrich for HIV- or SIV-infected CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in peripheral blood or lymphoid tissue; isolated CD32&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; resting CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells accounted for less than 3% of the total HIV DNA in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells.

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a catastrophic complication following total joint arthroplasty. Until now, the diagnosis of PJI is still confronted with difficulties, which is characterized by technical limitations. The question of whether sonication fluid PCR can provide high value in the diagnosis of PJI remains unanswered. This meta-analysis included 9 studies that evaluated PCR assays of sonication fluid for the diagnosis of PJI. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, Positive likelihood ratio (PLR), Negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 0.81), 0.96 (CI, 0.94 to 0.97), 18.24 (CI, 6.07 to 54.78), 0.27 (CI, 0.20 to 0.36) and 86.97 (CI, 37.08 to 203.97), respectively. The AUC value of the SROC was 0.9244 (standard error, 0.0212). Subgroup analyses showed that use of multiplex PCR and may improve sensitivity and specificity. The results of this meta-analysis showed that PCR of fluid after sonication is reliable and of great value in PJI diagnosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196418</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196418</link><unread>True</unread><title>Meta-analysis of sonication prosthetic fluid PCR for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection</title><updated>1524862800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196418</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d749:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196418</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kan Liu, Jun Fu, Baozhan Yu, Wei Sun, Jiying Chen, Libo Hao&lt;/p&gt;

From whole organisms to individual cells, responses to environmental conditions are influenced by genetic makeup, where the effect of genetic variation on a trait depends on the environmental context. RNA-sequencing quantifies gene expression as a molecular trait, and is capable of capturing both genetic and environmental effects. In this study, we explore opportunities of using allele-specific expression (ASE) to discover &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting genotype-environment interactions (GxE)—genetic effects on gene expression that depend on an environmental condition. Treating 17 common, clinical traits as approximations of the cellular environment of 267 skeletal muscle biopsies, we identify 10 candidate environmental response expression quantitative trait loci (reQTLs) across 6 traits (12 unique gene-environment trait pairs; 10% FDR per trait) including sex, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although using ASE is in principle a promising approach to detect GxE effects, replication of such signals can be challenging as validation requires harmonization of environmental traits across cohorts and a sufficient sampling of heterozygotes for a transcribed SNP. Comprehensive discovery and replication will require large human transcriptome datasets, or the integration of multiple transcribed SNPs, coupled with standardized clinical phenotyping.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523912400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195788</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195788</link><unread>True</unread><title>Interactions between genetic variation and cellular environment in skeletal muscle gene expression</title><updated>1523912400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195788</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae2:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195788</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by D.

Group B &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GBS) carriage by pregnant women is the primary risk factor for early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) can prevent this transmission route, and two main approaches are recommended to base the selection of pregnant women to be submitted to IAP: the risk-based and the culture-based strategies. In Brazil, compliance to such recommendations is poor, and not much is known about GBS carriage. In the present study, 3,647 pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were screened for GBS anogenital colonization, over a period of 8 years (2008–2015). GBS was detected in 956 (26.2%) of them, and presence of vaginal discharge was the only trait associated with a higher risk for GBS colonization. Serotypes Ia (257; 37.3%) and II (137; 19.9%) were the most frequent among 689 (72.1% of the total) GBS isolates evaluated, followed by NT isolates (84; 12.1%), serotype Ib (77; 11.1%), V (63; 9.1%), III (47; 6.8%) and IV (24; 3.5%). Estimated coverage of major serotype-based GBS vaccines currently under clinical trials would vary from 65.2% to 84.3%. All 689 isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, and tetracycline was observed in 5% (35), 2% (14), 14% (97), 5% (35) and 86% (592) of the isolates, respectively. No significant fluctuations in colonization rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were observed throughout the period of time investigated. The culture-based approach for IAP recommendation showed to be the best choice for the population investigated when compared to the risk-based, since the first did not increase the number of pregnant women submitted to antibiotic therapy and covered a larger number of women who were actually colonized by GBS. The fact the not all isolates were available for additional characterization, and serotype IX antiserum was not available for testing represent limitations of this study. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest investigation on GBS carriage among pregnant women in Brazil up to date, and results are useful for improving GBS prevention and treatment strategies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196925</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196925</link><unread>True</unread><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Streptococcus agalactiae&amp;lt;/i&gt; carriage among pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, over a period of eight years</title><updated>1526072400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196925</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6c:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196925</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Caroline N.

Group B &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GBS) carriage by pregnant women is the primary risk factor for early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) can prevent this transmission route, and two main approaches are recommended to base the selection of pregnant women to be submitted to IAP: the risk-based and the culture-based strategies. In Brazil, compliance to such recommendations is poor, and not much is known about GBS carriage. In the present study, 3,647 pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were screened for GBS anogenital colonization, over a period of 8 years (2008–2015). GBS was detected in 956 (26.2%) of them, and presence of vaginal discharge was the only trait associated with a higher risk for GBS colonization. Serotypes Ia (257; 37.3%) and II (137; 19.9%) were the most frequent among 689 (72.1% of the total) GBS isolates evaluated, followed by NT isolates (84; 12.1%), serotype Ib (77; 11.1%), V (63; 9.1%), III (47; 6.8%) and IV (24; 3.5%).

A high-throughput plant phenotyping system automatically observes and grows many plant samples. Many plant sample images are acquired by the system to determine the characteristics of the plants (populations). Stable image acquisition and processing is very important to accurately determine the characteristics. However, hardware for acquiring plant images rapidly and stably, while minimizing plant stress, is lacking. Moreover, most software cannot adequately handle large-scale plant imaging. To address these problems, we developed a new, automated, high-throughput plant phenotyping system using simple and robust hardware, and an automated plant-imaging-analysis pipeline consisting of machine-learning-based plant segmentation. Our hardware acquires images reliably and quickly and minimizes plant stress. Furthermore, the images are processed automatically. In particular, large-scale plant-image datasets can be segmented precisely using a classifier developed using a superpixel-based machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest), and variations in plant parameters (such as area) over time can be assessed using the segmented images. We performed comparative evaluations to identify an appropriate learning algorithm for our proposed system, and tested three robust learning algorithms. We developed not only an automatic analysis pipeline but also a convenient means of plant-growth analysis that provides a learning data interface and visualization of plant growth trends. Thus, our system allows end-users such as plant biologists to analyze plant growth via large-scale plant image data easily.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196615</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196615</link><unread>True</unread><title>An automated, high-throughput plant phenotyping system using machine learning-based plant segmentation and image analysis</title><updated>1524862800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196615</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d755:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196615</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Unseok Lee, Sungyul Chang, Gian Anantrio Putra, Hyoungseok Kim, Dong Hwan Kim&lt;/p&gt;

The controlled formation and stabilization of E-cadherin-based adhesions is vital for epithelial integrity. This requires co-operation between the E-cadherin-based adhesions and the associated actin cytoskeleton. In cancer, this co-operation often fails, predisposing cells to migration through molecular mechanisms that have only been partially characterized. Here, we demonstrate that the actin filament cross-linker α-actinin-1 is frequently increased in human breast cancer. In mammary epithelial cells, the increased α-actinin-1 levels promote cell migration and induce disorganized acini-like structures in Matrigel. This is accompanied by a major reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the associated E-cadherin-based adhesions. Increased expression of α-actinin-1 is particularly noted in basal-like breast cancer cell lines, and in breast cancer patients it associates with poor prognosis in basal-like subtypes. Downregulation of α-actinin-1 in E-cadherin expressing basal-like breast cancer cells demonstrate that α-actinin-1-assembled actin fibers destabilize E-cadherin-based adhesions. Taken together, these results indicate that increased α-actinin-1 expression destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions, which is likely to promote the migratory potential of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our results identify α-actinin-1 as a candidate prognostic biomarker in basal-like breast cancer.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196986</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196986</link><unread>True</unread><title>Increased α-actinin-1 destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions and associates with poor prognosis in basal-like breast cancer</title><updated>1525899600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196986</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3beda:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196986</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Kovac, Tomi P.

Newcastle disease (ND) causes severe economic loss to poultry industry worldwide. Frequent outbreaks of ND in commercial chickens vaccinated with live vaccines suggest a need to develop improved vaccines that are genetically matched against circulating Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains. In this study, the fusion protein cleavage site (FPCS) sequence of NDV strain Banjarmasin/010 (Banj), a genotype VII NDV, was individually modified using primer mutagenesis to those of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes 2, 7 and 8 and compared with the recombinant Banjarmasin (rBanj) with avirulent NDV LaSota cleavage site (rBanj-LaSota). These FPCS mutations changed the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell-to-cell fusion activity and made rBanj FPCS mutant viruses highly attenuated in chickens. When chickens immunized with the rBanj FPCS mutant viruses and challenged with the virulent Banj, there was reduced challenge virus shedding observed compared to chickens immunized with the heterologous vaccine strain LaSota. Among the genotype VII NDV Banj vaccine candidates, rBanj-LaSota and rBanj containing FPCS of APMV-8 induced highest neutralizing antibody titers and protected chickens with reduced challenge virus shedding. These results show the effect of the F protein cleavage site sequence in generating genotype VII matched NDV vaccines.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526331600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197253</link><unread>True</unread><title>Effect of fusion protein cleavage site sequence on generation of a genotype VII Newcastle disease virus vaccine</title><updated>1526331600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197253</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219d:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197253</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vinoth K.

These results show the effect of the F protein cleavage site sequence in generating genotype VII matched NDV vaccines.</description><fingerprint>721947cc</fingerprint><author><name>Vinoth K.

Sample-induced image-degradation remains an intricate wave-optical problem in light-sheet microscopy. Here we present &lt;i&gt;biobeam&lt;/i&gt;, an open-source software package that enables simulation of operational light-sheet microscopes by combining data from 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; multiplexed and GPU-accelerated point-spread-function calculations. The wave-optical nature of these simulations leads to the faithful reproduction of spatially varying aberrations, diffraction artifacts, geometric image distortions, adaptive optics, and emergent wave-optical phenomena, and renders image-formation in light-sheet microscopy computationally tractable.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r2Zl1-90KGY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523653200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006079</link><recrawled>1523652128492</recrawled><unread>False</unread><title>Biobeam—Multiplexed wave-optical simulations of light-sheet microscopy</title><updated>1523653200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006079</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006079</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162c035fc8a:4de0e9:bdf8aaf1</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/r2Zl1-90KGY/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martin Weigert, Kaushikaram Subramanian, Sebastian T.

Monocyte-like cell lines (MCLCs), including THP-1, HL-60 and U-937 cells, are used routinely as surrogates for isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To systematically evaluate these immortalised cells and PBMCs as model systems to study inflammation relevant to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes and immuno-metabolism, we compared mRNA expression of inflammation-relevant genes, cell surface expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers, and chemotactic responses to inflammatory stimuli. Messenger RNA expression analysis suggested most genes were present at similar levels across all undifferentiated cells, though notably, &lt;i&gt;IDO1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes for indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and catabolises tryptophan to kynureninase (shown to be elevated in serum from diabetic patients), was not expressed in any PMA-treated MCLC, but present in GM-CSF-treated PBMCs. There was little overall difference in the pattern of expression of CD markers across all cells, though absolute expression levels varied considerably and the correlation between MCLCs and PBMCs was improved upon MCLC differentiation. Functionally, THP-1 and PBMCs migrated in response to chemoattractants in a transwell assay, with varying sensitivity to MCP-1, MIP-1α and LTB-4. However, despite similar gene and CD expression profiles, U-937 cells were functionally impaired as no migration was observed to any chemoattractant. Our analysis reveals that the MCLCs examined only partly replicate the genotypic and phenotypic properties of human PBMCs. To overcome such issues a universal differentiation protocol should be implemented for these cell lines, similar to those already used with isolated monocytes. Although not perfect, in our hands the THP-1 cells represent the closest, simplified surrogate model of PBMCs for study of inflammatory cell migration.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197177</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197177</link><unread>True</unread><title>Comparative genotypic and phenotypic analysis of human peripheral blood monocytes and surrogate monocyte-like cell lines commonly used in metabolic disease research</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197177</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559156:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197177</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Darren M.

Mutations in the &lt;i&gt;Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5)&lt;/i&gt; gene cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Recently we have generated &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; KO mice by targeting exon 2 on the C57BL/6N background, and demonstrated postsynaptic overaccumulation of GluN2B-containing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus. In the current study, we subjected the &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; KO mice to a battery of comprehensive behavioral tests, aiming to reveal the effects of loss of CDKL5 in a whole perspective of motor, emotional, social, and cognition/memory functions, and to identify its undetermined roles. The neurological screen, rotarod, hot plate, prepulse inhibition, light/dark transition, open field, elevated plus maze, Porsolt forced swim, tail suspension, one-chamber and three-chamber social interaction, 24-h home cage monitoring, contextual and cued fear conditioning, Barnes maze, and T-maze tests were applied on adult &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y and +/Y mice. &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice showed a mild alteration in the gait. Analyses of emotional behaviors revealed significantly enhanced anxiety-like behaviors of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice. Depressive-like behaviors and social interaction of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice were uniquely altered. The contextual and cued fear conditioning of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice were comparable to control mice; however, &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice showed a significantly increased freezing time and a significantly decreased distance traveled during the pretone period in the altered context. Both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory were significantly impaired. The morphometric analysis of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed impaired dendritic arborization and immature spine development in &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice. These results indicate that CDKL5 plays significant roles in regulating emotional behaviors especially on anxiety- and fear-related responses, and in both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory, which suggests that focus and special attention should be paid to the specific mechanisms of these deficits in the CDKL5 deficiency disorder.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196587</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196587</link><unread>True</unread><title>Comprehensive behavioral analysis of the &amp;lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&amp;lt;/i&gt; knockout mice revealed significant enhancement in anxiety- and fear-related behaviors and impairment in both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory</title><updated>1524862800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196587</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d752:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196587</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kosuke Okuda, Keizo Takao, Aya Watanabe, Tsuyoshi Miyakawa, Masashi Mizuguchi, Teruyuki Tanaka&lt;/p&gt;

The results suggest several isomers with superior predicted electron mobilities to 1 and suggest two molecules in particular that represent attractive synthetic targets.</description><fingerprint>f7cadf4c</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1523973906685</crawled><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Large_Scale_Computational_Screening_of_Molecular_Organic_Semiconductors_Using_Crystal_Structure_Prediction/6143732</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Richard Feynman at 100&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Feynman at 100, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05082-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05082-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Paul Halpern celebrates the oeuvre of the brilliant, unconventional scientist.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525762800000</published><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05082-4/d41586-018-05082-4_15732116.jpg</url><width>1024</width><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05082-4</link><unread>True</unread><title>Richard Feynman at 100</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05082-4</originId><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1633f15d59d:1397de:3dd877af</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05082-4</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Richard Feynman at 100&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Feynman at 100, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05082-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05082-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Paul Halpern celebrates the oeuvre of the brilliant, unconventional scientist.</description><engagementRate>6.48</engagementRate><fingerprint>ab6ccf49</fingerprint><author><name>Paul Halpern</name></author><crawled>1525771785629</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1258</engagement></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/15&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524140721000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020372?af=R</link><unread>True</unread><title>Chemical waves in the O2 + H2 reaction on a Rh(111) surface alloyed with nickel.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In light of the limited impact the syndromic management approach has had on the global sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic, we assessed a care model comprising point-of-care (POC) STI testing, immediate treatment, and expedited partner therapy (EPT) among a cohort of young women at high HIV risk in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;HIV negative women presenting for STI care underwent POC testing for &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT), &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; (NG) and &lt;i&gt;Trichomonas vaginalis&lt;/i&gt; (TV), and swabs were sent for NG culture and susceptibility testing. Results were available within 2 hours and women with STIs were immediately treated and offered EPT packs, including medication, condoms, and information for sexual partners. An EPT questionnaire was administered after one week, and women retested for STIs after 6 and 12 weeks. 267 women, median age 23 (IQR 21–26), were recruited and 88.4% (236/267) reported genital symptoms. STI prevalence was CT 18.4% (95%CI 13.7–23.0), NG 5.2% (95%CI 2.6–7.9) and TV 3.0% (95%CI 1.0–5.0). After 12 weeks, all but one NG and two CT infections were cleared. No cephalosporin-resistant NG was detected. Of 63/267 women (23.6%) diagnosed with STIs, 98.4% (62/63) were offered and 87.1% (54/62) accepted EPT. At one week 88.9% (48/54) stated that their partner had taken the medication. No allergic reactions or social harms were reported. Of 51 women completing 6-week follow up, detection rates were lower amongst women receiving EPT (2.2%, 1/46) compared to those who did not (40.0%, 2/5), p = 0.023. During focus group discussions women supported the care model, because they received a rapid, specific diagnosis, and could facilitate their partners’ treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;POC STI testing and EPT were acceptable to young South African women and their partners, and could play an important role in reducing STI reinfection rates and HIV risk.

The biological properties of essential oils have been demonstrated in the treatment of several diseases and to enhance the bioavailability of other drugs. In natural habitats the essential oils compounds may play important roles in the protection of the plants as antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, insecticides and also against herbivores by reducing their appetite for such plants or by repelling undesirable others. We analyzed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry the chemical composition of the essential oil of aerial parts of &lt;i&gt;Glandora rosmarinifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Ten.) D.C. Thomas obtained by hydrodistillation and verified some biological activities on a panel of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HA22T/VGH, HepG2, Hep3B) and triple negative breast cancer cell lines (SUM 149, MDA-MB-231). In the essential oil we detected 35 compounds. The results of the biological assays indicate that essential oil of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rosmarinifolia&lt;/i&gt; induces cell growth inhibition at concentration-dependent way in all cell line models. This oil does not seem to possess antioxidant activity, while the cytotoxicity of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rosmarinifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil appeared to involve, at least in part, a pro-oxidant mechanism.

Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal deaths. The aetiology of preeclampsia is largely unknown but a polygenetic component is assumed. To explore this hypothesis, we performed an in-depth whole-exome sequencing study in women with (cases, N = 50) and without (controls, N = 50) preeclampsia. The women were identified in an unselected cohort of 2,545 pregnant women based on data from the Danish National Patient Registry and the Medical Birth Registry. Matching DNA was obtained from a biobank containing excess blood from routine antenatal care visits. Novogene performed the whole-exome sequencing blinded to preeclampsia status. Variants for comparison between cases and controls were filtered in the Ingenuity Variant Analysis software. We applied two different strategies; a &lt;i&gt;disease association panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included variants in single genes associated with established clinical risk factors for preeclampsia, and a &lt;i&gt;gene panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included biological pathways harbouring genes previously reported to be associated with preeclampsia. Variant variability was compared in cases and controls at the level of biological processes, signalling pathways, and in single genes. Regardless of the applied strategy and the level of variability examined, we consistently found positive correlations between variant numbers in cases and controls (all R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s&gt;0.88). Contrary to what was expected, cases carried fewer variants in biological processes and signalling pathways than controls (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-values ≤0.02). In conclusion, our findings challenge the hypothesis of a polygenetic aetiology for preeclampsia with a common network of susceptibility genes. The greater genetic diversity among controls may suggest a protective role of genetic diversity against the development of preeclampsia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526331600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197217</link><unread>True</unread><title>The genetic component of preeclampsia: A whole-exome sequencing study</title><updated>1526331600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197217</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219b:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197217</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anette Tarp Hansen, Jens Magnus Bernth Jensen, Anne-Mette Hvas, Mette Christiansen&lt;/p&gt;

Trace metal dynamics have not been studied with respect to growth increments in octocorals. It is particularly unknown whether ontogenetic compartmentalization of trace metal accumulation is species-specific. We studied here for the first time the intracolonial distribution and concentrations of 18 trace metals in the octocorals &lt;i&gt;Subergorgia suberosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Echinogorgia complexa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;reticulata&lt;/i&gt; that were retrieved from the northern coast of Taiwan. Levels of trace metals were considerably elevated in corals collected at these particular coral habitats as a result of diverse anthropogenic inputs. There was a significant difference in the concentration of metals among octocorals except for Sn. Both species of &lt;i&gt;Echinogorgia&lt;/i&gt; contained significantly higher concentrations of Cu, Zn and Al than &lt;i&gt;Subergorgia suberosa&lt;/i&gt;. We used for the first time exponential growth curves that describe an age-specific relationship of octocoral trace metal concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb where the distance from the grip point was reflecting younger age as linear regressions. The larger colony (C7) had a lower accumulation rate constant than the smaller one (C6) for Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb, while other trace metals showed an opposite trend. The Cu concentration declined exponentially from the grip point, whereas the concentrations of Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb increased exponentially. In &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;suberosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;reticulata&lt;/i&gt;, Zn occurred primarily in coenosarc tissues and Zn concentrations increased with distance from the grip point in both skeletal and coenosarc tissues. Metals which appeared at high concentrations (e.g. Ca, Zn and Fe) generally tended to accumulate in the outer coenosarc tissues, while metals with low concentrations (e.g. V) tended to accumulate in the soft tissues of the inner skeleton.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524517200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196222</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196222</link><unread>True</unread><title>Bioaccumulation of trace metals in octocorals depends on age and tissue compartmentalization</title><updated>1524517200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196222</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb9c:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196222</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jiang-Shiou Hwang, Hans-Uwe Dahms, Ke Li Huang, Mu-Yeh Huang, Xue-Jun Liu, Jong Seong Khim, Chong Kim Wong&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Prescribing individualized moderate exercise intensity is a useful method to reach positive effects on health status in obese adults. This study aimed to establish a practical reference equation to estimate the heart rate (HR) at individual ventilatory threshold (IVT) (HR&lt;sub&gt;IVT&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;One hundred sixty-one obese subjects were clinically evaluated and characterized by anthropometric and body composition. Participants performed the six-minute walking test (6-MWT) and the cardiopulmonary exercise test to assess IVT. Multiple regression analysis for HR&lt;sub&gt;IVT&lt;/sub&gt;, including 6-MWT, anthropometric, and body composition parameters, as independent variables, was performed for both gender separately. A cross-validation study was also performed to determine the accuracy of the prediction equation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Whereas HR&lt;sub&gt;IVT&lt;/sub&gt; was not significantly different between males (121.5±18.3 bpm) and females (117.6±17.1 bpm), it differently correlated with physical and performance parameters. Therefore, two sex-specific equations were developed including 6-MWT&lt;sub&gt;HR&lt;/sub&gt; and HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.69 and 0.65 and root mean square errors of 8.8 and 10.1 bpm for females and males, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, in female and male obese adults, the 6-MWT might be used to predict HR at IVT. These outcomes are useful to prescribe optimal physical activity intensity when gold standard methods (e.g. gas exchange analysis) are unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197255</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197255</link><unread>True</unread><title>Prediction equation to estimate heart rate at individual ventilatory threshold in female and male obese adults</title><updated>1526072400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197255</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7c:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197255</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gian Pietro Emerenziani, Dafne Ferrari, Maria Grazia Vaccaro, Maria Chiara Gallotta, Silvia Migliaccio, Andrea Lenzi, Carlo Baldari, Laura Guidetti&lt;/p&gt;

Unpasteurized dairy products are known to occasionally harbor &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and have been implicated in recent listeriosis outbreaks and numerous sporadic cases of listeriosis. However, the diversity and virulence profiles of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from these products have not been fully described. Here we report a genomic analysis of 121 &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from milk, milk filters, and milking equipment collected from bovine dairy farms in 19 states over a 12-year period. In a multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) analysis, 59 Virulence Types (VT) were identified, of which 25% were Epidemic Clones I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, or X, and 31 were novel VT. In a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis, 60 Sequence Types (ST) of 56 Clonal Complexes (CC) were identified. Within lineage I, CC5 and CC1 were among the most abundant, and within lineage II, CC7 and CC37 were the most abundant. Multiple CCs previously associated with central nervous system and maternal-neonatal infections were identified. A genomic analysis identified variable distribution of virulence markers, &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; pathogenicity islands (LIPI) -1, -3, and -4, and stress survival island-1 (SSI-1). Of these, 14 virulence markers, including LIPI-3 and -4 were more frequently detected in one lineage (I or II) than the other. LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks.

Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and patient-level genetic assessments can guide therapy choice and impact prognosis. However, little is known about the impact of genetic variability within a tumor, intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), on disease progression or outcome. Current approaches using bulk tumor specimens can suggest the presence of ITH, but only single-cell genetic methods have the resolution to describe the underlying clonal structures themselves. Current techniques tend to be labor and resource intensive and challenging to characterize with respect to sources of biological and technical variability. We have developed a platform using a microfluidic self-digitization chip to partition cells in stationary volumes for cell imaging and allele-specific PCR. Genotyping data from only confirmed single-cell volumes is obtained and subject to a variety of relevant quality control assessments such as allele dropout, false positive, and false negative rates. We demonstrate single-cell genotyping of the &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt; type A mutation, an important prognostic indicator in acute myeloid leukemia, on single cells of the cell line OCI-AML3, describing a more complex zygosity distribution than would be predicted via bulk analysis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196801</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196801</link><unread>True</unread><title>Self-digitization chip for single-cell genotyping of cancer-related mutations</title><updated>1525294800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196801</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a192:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196801</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alison M.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To examine the reported mental health outcomes of adolescent foreign-born non-citizens and adolescent foreign-born U.S. citizens compared to adolescent U.S.-born citizens.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in the National Health Interview Survey, we compared mental health status of U.S.-born adolescent citizens to foreign-born citizens and non-citizens in the years 2010–2015, and examined how differences in emotional difficulty changed based on time spent in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Results suggest that non-citizen adolescents experience better mental health outcomes than U.S.-born citizens.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To examine the reported mental health outcomes of adolescent foreign-born non-citizens and adolescent foreign-born U.S. citizens compared to adolescent U.S.-born citizens.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in the National Health Interview Survey, we compared mental health status of U.S.-born adolescent citizens to foreign-born citizens and non-citizens in the years 2010–2015, and examined how differences in emotional difficulty changed based on time spent in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Results suggest that non-citizen adolescents experience better mental health outcomes than U.S.-born citizens. However, the mental health status of foreign-born citizens is indistinguishable from that of the U.S.-born, after accounting for basic socio-demographic characteristics. The prevalence of emotional difficulty experienced by immigrant adolescents increased with a family’s duration in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings are consistent with a broader health advantage for the foreign-born, but we present new evidence that the mental health advantage of foreign-born adolescents exists only for non-citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>7bb009f8</fingerprint><author><name>Nicole Filion</name></author><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rajkumar Kishor, G.

The P8 stem-loop region of the &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L intron, which is known to be hypervariable in size with multiple repeat motifs and created difficulties in alignment, is always excluded in phylogenetic as well as barcode analyses. This region was investigated for species discrimination in 98 taxa of orchids belonging to the tribe Vandeae using in silico mapping of restriction site polymorphism. The length of the P8 regions varied from 200 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Aerides rosea&lt;/i&gt; to 669 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Dendrophylax sallei&lt;/i&gt;. Forty two taxa had unique lengths, while as many as eight shared a common length of 521 nucleotides. Of the 35 restriction endonucleases producing digestions in the P8 regions, three, viz., &lt;i&gt;Ags&lt;/i&gt;I, &lt;i&gt;Apo&lt;/i&gt;I and &lt;i&gt;Tsp&lt;/i&gt;DTI turned out to have recognition sites across all the 98 taxa being studied. When their restriction data were combined, 92 taxa could be discriminated leaving three taxon pairs. However, &lt;i&gt;Acampe papillosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aeranthes arachnites&lt;/i&gt; despite having similar restriction sites differed in their P8 lengths.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Different phenotypes of wheezing have been described to date but not in early life. We aim to describe wheezing phenotypes between the ages of two months and one year, and assess risk factors associated with these wheezing phenotypes in a large birth cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 18,041 infants from the ELFE (French Longitudinal Study of Children) birth cohort. Parents reported wheezing and respiratory symptoms at two and 12 months, and answered a complete questionnaire (exposure during pregnancy, parental allergy).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Children with no symptoms (controls) accounted for 77.2%, 2.1% had had wheezing at two months but no wheezing at one year (intermittent), 2.4% had persistent wheezing, while 18.3% had incident wheezing at one year. Comparing persistent wheezing to controls showed that having one sibling (ORa = 2.19) or 2 siblings (ORa = 2.23) compared to none, nocturnal cough (OR = 5.2), respiratory distress (OR = 4.1) and excess bronchial secretions (OR = 3.47) at two months, reflux in the child at 2 months (OR = 1.55), maternal history of asthma (OR = 1.46) and maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.57) were significantly associated with persistent wheezing. These same factors, along with cutaneous rash in the child at 2 months (OR = 1.13) and paternal history of asthma (OR = 1.32) were significantly associated with increased odds of incident wheezing. Having one sibling (ORa = 1.9) compared to none, nocturnal cough at 2 months (OR = 1.76) and excess bronchial secretions at 2 months (OR = 1.65) were significantly associated with persistent compared to intermittent wheezing.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Respiratory symptoms (cough, respiratory distress, and excessive bronchial secretion) were significantly associated with a high risk of persistent wheezing at one year.

The objective of this paper is to fill a gap in the literature on internationalization, in relation to the absence of objective and measurable performance indicators for the process of how firms sequentially enter external markets. To that end, this research develops a quantitative tool for use as a performance indicator of gradualness for firms entering external markets at a sectoral level. The performance indicator is based on firms’ export volumes, number of years operating in the export market, geographic areas targeted for export and when exports began to each area. The indicator is tested empirically in the wine sector. The main contribution of this study is the creation of a reliable international priority index, which can serve more widely as a valuable tool because of its potential use in other industry sectors and geographic areas, and which would allow the analysis of how geographically differentiated internationalization strategies develop.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525467600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196804</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196804</link><unread>True</unread><title>Measuring the gradualist approach to internationalization: Empirical evidence from the wine sector</title><updated>1525467600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196804</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1632c3c60b0:1621677:3dd877af</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196804</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mónica Clavel San Emeterio, Rubén Fernández-Ortiz, Jesús Arteaga-Ortiz, Pablo Dorta-González&lt;/p&gt;

Ultrastructural and super-resolution light microscopy showed that the CALHM1 channels were consistently associated with distinctive, large (1- to 2-μm) mitochondria spaced 20 to 40 nm from the presynaptic membrane. Pharmacological disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain limited the ability of taste cells to release ATP, suggesting that the immediate source of released ATP was the mitochondrion rather than a cytoplasmic pool of ATP. These large mitochondria may serve as both a reservoir of releasable ATP and the site of synthesis. The juxtaposition of the large mitochondria to areas of membrane displaying CALHM1 also defines a restricted compartment that limits the influx of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; upon opening of the nonselective CALHM1 channels.

Pharmacological disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain limited the ability of taste cells to release ATP, suggesting that the immediate source of released ATP was the mitochondrion rather than a cytoplasmic pool of ATP. These large mitochondria may serve as both a reservoir of releasable ATP and the site of synthesis. The juxtaposition of the large mitochondria to areas of membrane displaying CALHM1 also defines a restricted compartment that limits the influx of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; upon opening of the nonselective CALHM1 channels. These findings reveal a distinctive organelle signature and functional organization for regulated, focal release of purinergic signals in the absence of synaptic vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagementRate>4.92</engagementRate><fingerprint>a261e1fb</fingerprint><author><name>Romanov, R.

Mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is a key regulator of organelle physiology and the excessive increase in mitochondrial calcium is associated with the oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial calcium to inflammatory and coagulative responses in hepatocytes exposed to high glucose (HG) (33mM glucose). Treatment of HepG2 cells with HG for 24 h induced insulin resistance, as demonstrated by an impairment of insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. HepG2 treatment with HG led to an increase in mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake, while cytosolic calcium remained unchanged. Inhibition of MCU by lentiviral-mediated shRNA prevented mitochondrial calcium uptake and downregulated the inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6) and coagulative (PAI-1 and FGA) mRNA expression in HepG2 cells exposed to HG. The protection from HG-induced inflammation by MCU inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, MCU inhibition in HepG2 cells abrogated the phosphorylation of p38, JNK and IKKα/IKKβ in HG treated cells. Taken together, these data suggest that MCU inhibition may represent a promising therapy for prevention of deleterious effects of obesity and metabolic diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525122000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196580</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196580</link><unread>True</unread><title>MCU-knockdown attenuates high glucose-induced inflammation through regulating MAPKs/NF-κB pathways and ROS production in HepG2 cells</title><updated>1525122000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196580</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e52:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196580</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ghodratollah Panahi, Parvin Pasalar, Mina Zare, Rosario Rizzuto, Reza Meshkani&lt;/p&gt;

This package fits linear, binomial (logistic) and multinomial models, and provides a set of standard plots, summary statistics and output tables. eNetXplorer enables quantitative, exploratory analysis to generate hypotheses on which features may be associated with biological phenotypes of interest, such as in the identification of biomarkers for therapeutic responsiveness.</description><fingerprint>3b70c4f6</fingerprint><author><name>Candia, J.</name></author><crawled>1525139266920</crawled><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/305870v1?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0149-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524121200000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6</link><unread>True</unread><title>Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Neuroscience</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6</originId><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_162dd386e29:40991ef:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0149-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain</description><fingerprint>7d06a78e</fingerprint><author><name>Jing Huang</name></author><crawled>1524129885737</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>Metabolite identification is a long-standing challenge in untargeted metabolomics and a major hurdle for functional metabolomics studies.

Attempts to reduce this redundancy have focused on visualizing pathway overlap or merging pathways, but the resulting pathways may be of heterogeneous sizes and cover multiple biological functions.

The proposed approach considers three objectives: removal of pathway redundancy, controlling pathway size and coverage of the gene set. By applying set cover to the ConsensusPathDB dataset we were able to produce a reduced set of pathways, representing 100% of the genes in the original data set with 74% less redundancy, or 95% of the genes with 88% less redundancy. We also developed an algorithm to simplify enrichment data and applied it to a set of enriched osteoarthritis pathways, revealing that within the top ten pathways, five were redundant subsets of more enriched pathways. Applying set cover to the enrichment results removed these redundant pathways allowing more informative pathways to take their place. Conclusion: Our method provides an alternative approach for handling pathway redundancy, while ensuring that the pathways are of homogeneous size and gene coverage is maximised.

Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (&lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been widely related to neuropsychiatry disorders. The localization of ANKK1 in neural progenitors and its correlation with the cell cycle has suggested its participation in development. However, ANKK1 functions still need to be identified. Here, we have further characterized the ANKK1 localization &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, by using immunolabeling, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in the myogenic lineage. Histologic investigations in mice and humans revealed that ANKK1 is expressed in precursors of embryonic and adult muscles. In mice embryos, ANKK1 was found in migrating myotubes where it shows a polarized cytoplasmic distribution, while proliferative myoblasts and satellite cells show different isoforms in their nuclei and cytoplasm. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of ANKK1 protein isoforms along the myogenic progression showed the decline of nuclear ANKK1-kinase until its total exclusion in myotubes. In adult mice, ANKK1 was expressed exclusively in the Fast-Twitch muscles fibers subtype. The induction of glycolytic metabolism in C2C12 cells with high glucose concentration or treatment with berberine caused a significant increase in the &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Similarly, C2C12 cells under hypoxic conditions caused the increase of nuclear ANKK1. These results altogether show a relationship between &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation and the metabolism of muscles during development and in adulthood. Finally, we found ANKK1 expression in regenerative fibers of muscles from dystrophic patients. Future studies in ANKK1 biology and the pathological response of muscles will reveal whether this protein is a novel muscle disease biomarker.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526331600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197254</link><unread>True</unread><title>ANKK1 is found in myogenic precursors and muscle fibers subtypes with glycolytic metabolism</title><updated>1526331600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197254</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219e:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197254</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Estrella Rubio-Solsona, Salvador Martí, Juan J.

Background &lt;p&gt;In a study conducted in Bhopal district (a setting with facility for molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST)) located in central India in 2014–15, we found high levels of pre-diagnosis attrition among patients with presumptive multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)–meaning TB patients who were eligible for DST, were not being tested.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored the health care provider perspectives into barriers and suggested solutions for improving DST.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a descriptive qualitative study. One to one interviews (n = 10) and focus group discussions (n = 2) with experienced key informants involved in programmatic management of DR-TB were conducted in April 2017. Manual descriptive thematic analysis was performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The key barriers reported were a) lack of or delay in identification of patients eligible for DST because of using treatment register as the source for identifying patients b) lack of assured specimen transport after patient identification and c) lack of tracking. Extra pulmonary TB patients were not getting identified as eligible for DST. Solutions suggested by the health care providers were i) generation of unique identifier at identification in designated microscopy center (DMC), immediate intimation of unique identifier to district and regular monitoring by senior TB laboratory and senior treatment supervisors of patients eligible for DST that were missed; ii) documentation of unique identifier at each step of cascade; iii) use of human carriers/couriers to transport specimen from DMCs especially in rural areas; and iv) routine entry of all presumptive extra-pulmonary TB specimen, as far as possible, in DMC laboratory register.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Lack of assured specimen transport and lack of accountability for tracking patient after identification and referral were the key barriers. The identification of patients eligible for DST among microbiologically confirmed TB at the time of diagnosis and among clinically confirmed TB at the time of treatment initiation is the key. Use of unique identifier at identification and its use to ensure cohort wise tracking has to be complemented with specimen transport support and prompt feedback to the DMC. The study has implications to improve detection of MDR-TB among diagnosed/notified TB patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524258000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196162</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196162</link><unread>True</unread><title>Provider reported barriers and solutions to improve testing among tuberculosis patients ‘eligible for drug susceptibility test’: A qualitative study from programmatic setting in India</title><updated>1524258000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196162</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e803:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196162</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hemant Deepak Shewade, Arun M.

Solutions suggested by the health care providers were i) generation of unique identifier at identification in designated microscopy center (DMC), immediate intimation of unique identifier to district and regular monitoring by senior TB laboratory and senior treatment supervisors of patients eligible for DST that were missed; ii) documentation of unique identifier at each step of cascade; iii) use of human carriers/couriers to transport specimen from DMCs especially in rural areas; and iv) routine entry of all presumptive extra-pulmonary TB specimen, as far as possible, in DMC laboratory register.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Lack of assured specimen transport and lack of accountability for tracking patient after identification and referral were the key barriers. The identification of patients eligible for DST among microbiologically confirmed TB at the time of diagnosis and among clinically confirmed TB at the time of treatment initiation is the key. Use of unique identifier at identification and its use to ensure cohort wise tracking has to be complemented with specimen transport support and prompt feedback to the DMC. The study has implications to improve detection of MDR-TB among diagnosed/notified TB patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>a647418a</fingerprint><author><name>Hemant Deepak Shewade</name></author><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Long-lost data reveal astronauts’ mark on the Moon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-lost data reveal astronauts’ mark on the Moon, Published online: 04 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05107-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05107-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Effect reached up to one metre below the dusty surface.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525417200000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05107-y</link><unread>True</unread><title>Long-lost data reveal astronauts’ mark on the Moon</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05107-y</originId><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1632bf56372:15aba99:3dd877af</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05107-y</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Long-lost data reveal astronauts’ mark on the Moon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-lost data reveal astronauts’ mark on the Moon, Published online: 04 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05107-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05107-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Effect reached up to one metre below the dusty surface.</description><fingerprint>1450eaa1</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1525450892146</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>31</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transporter gene acquisition and innovation in the evolution of Microsporidia intracellular parasites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transporter gene acquisition and innovation in the evolution of Microsporidia intracellular parasites, Published online: 27 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03923-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03923-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that infect both humans and animals.

Decision-making is usually accompanied by metacognition, through which a decision maker monitors uncertainty regarding a decision and may then consequently revise the decision. These metacognitive processes can occur prior to or in the absence of feedback. However, the neural mechanisms of metacognition remain controversial. One theory proposes an independent neural system for metacognition in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); the other, that metacognitive processes coincide and overlap with the systems used for the decision-making process per se. In this study, we devised a novel “decision–redecision” paradigm to investigate the neural metacognitive processes involved in redecision as compared to the initial decision-making process. The participants underwent a perceptual decision-making task and a rule-based decision-making task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that the anterior PFC, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), were more extensively activated after the initial decision. The dACC activity in redecision positively scaled with decision uncertainty and correlated with individual metacognitive uncertainty monitoring abilities—commonly occurring in both tasks—indicating that the dACC was specifically involved in decision uncertainty monitoring. In contrast, the lFPC activity seen in redecision processing was scaled with decision uncertainty reduction and correlated with individual accuracy changes—positively in the rule-based decision-making task and negatively in the perceptual decision-making task. Our results show that the lFPC was specifically involved in metacognitive control of decision adjustment and was subject to different control demands of the tasks. Therefore, our findings support that a separate neural system in the PFC is essentially involved in metacognition and further, that functions of the PFC in metacognition are dissociable.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/UPQeF4yIjs0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524517200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004037</link><recrawled>1525453924895</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>The neural system of metacognition accompanying decision-making in the prefrontal cortex</title><updated>1524517200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004037</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004037</originId><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f3ad5b12:38e8b1:76251cdd</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/UPQeF4yIjs0/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lirong Qiu, Jie Su, Yinmei Ni, Yang Bai, Xuesong Zhang, Xiaoli Li, Xiaohong Wan&lt;/p&gt;

Cave roosting bats represent an important component of Southeast Asian bat diversity and are vulnerable to human disturbance during critical reproductive periods (pregnancy, lactation and weaning). Because dramatic growth of cave tourism in recent decades has raised concerns about impacts on cave bats in the region, we assessed the reproductive phenology of two insectivorous species (&lt;i&gt;Hipposideros larvatus&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato and &lt;i&gt;Taphozous melanopogon&lt;/i&gt;) at three caves in Cambodia for 23 months in 2014–2016 and evaluated human visitation to these sites between 2007 and 2014. Despite the differing foraging strategies employed by the two taxa, the temporal consistency observed in proportions of pregnant, lactating and juvenile bats indicates that their major birth peaks coincide with the time of greatest cave visitation annually, particularly for domestic visitors and namely during the Cambodian new year in April. They also reflect rainfall patterns and correspond with the reproductive phenology of insectivorous cave bats in Vietnam. These findings were predictable because 1) insect biomass and thus food availability for insectivorous bats are optimal for ensuring survival of young following this period, and 2) the Khmer new year is the most significant month for religious ceremonies and thus domestic cave visitation nationally, due to the abundance of Buddhist shrines and temples in Cambodian caves. While the impact of visitor disturbance on bat population recruitment cannot be empirically assessed due to lack of historical data, it is nonetheless likely to have been considerable and raises a conservation concern. Further, because growing evidence suggests that insectivorous cave bats exhibit reproductive synchrony across continental Southeast Asia where countless cave shrines are heavily frequented during April in Theravada Buddhist countries (e.g., Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos), our results may have wider applicability in the region. We consequently advocate for increased emphasis on sustainable cave management practices in Cambodia and further investigations to determine whether our findings present a broader concern for cave bat conservation in Southeast Asia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525122000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196554</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196554</link><unread>True</unread><title>Insectivorous bat reproduction and human cave visitation in Cambodia: A perfect conservation storm?</title><updated>1525122000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196554</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4f:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196554</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thona Lim, Julien Cappelle, Thavry Hoem, Neil Furey&lt;/p&gt;

This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the interpersonal network structures within a sub-sample of stakeholders from two past successful childhood obesity prevention interventions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Participants were recruited from the stakeholder groups (steering committees) of two completed community-based intervention studies, Romp &amp;amp; Chomp (R&amp;amp;C), Australia (2004-2008) and Shape Up Somerville (SUS), USA (2003-2005). Both studies demonstrated significant reductions of overweight and obesity among children. Members of the steering committees were asked to complete a retrospective social network questionnaire using a roster of other committee members and free recall. Each participant was asked to recall the people with whom they discussed issues related to childhood obesity throughout the intervention period, along with providing the closeness and level of influence of each relationship.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Networks were reported by 13 participants from the SUS steering committee and 8 participants from the R&amp;amp;C steering committee. On average, participants nominated 16 contacts with whom they discussed issues related to childhood obesity through the intervention, with approximately half of the relationships described as ‘close’ and 30% as ‘influential’. The ‘discussion’ and ‘close’ networks had high clustering and reciprocity, with ties directed to other steering committee members, and to individuals external to the committee. In contrast, influential ties were more prominently directed internal to the steering committee, with higher network centralization, lower reciprocity and lower clustering.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion and conclusion &lt;p&gt;Social network analysis provides a method to evaluate the ties within steering committees of community-based obesity prevention interventions.

Background &lt;p&gt;Body fatness is associated with risk of coronary heart disease and it has been postulated that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) may have a particularly detrimental effect because of its localized toxic effects. We therefore aimed to examine the association between EAT and coronary artery calcification and compared this with associations for visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and other regional fat depots.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study of 487 Chinese participants aged 50 years old and above, living in Singapore. Participants, free from known diabetes mellitus and coronary heart diseases, completed interviews, a health screening to evaluate obesity and cardiovascular disease risk factors, and computed tomography scans of the abdomen and coronary arteries. Associations between regional fat depots and subclinical atherosclerosis defined as CAC&gt; = 100 were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) was highly correlated with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (Pearson r = 0.72) and trunk fat mass (r = 0.66). The age and sex-adjusted odd ratio (OR) (in 1-SD increase) of subclinical atherosclerosis was 1.28 (1.01–1.61) for EAT and 1.40 (1.04–1.88) for VAT. These associations were weaker and non-significant after adjusting for markers of dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia. Total body fat, subcutaneous abdominal fat, and leg, arm and trunk fat mass were not significantly associated with atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;VAT and EAT showed similar associations with coronary artery calcification and the associations could be mediated by traditional risk factors in this ethnic Chinese population.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524690000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196328</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196328</link><unread>True</unread><title>Epicardial and visceral adipose tissue in relation to subclinical atherosclerosis in a Chinese population</title><updated>1524690000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196328</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67bc:91749e5b</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196328</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nang Ei Ei Khaing, Tai E.

Zinc is an essential micronutrient required for proper structure and function of many proteins. Bacteria regularly encounter zinc depletion and have evolved diverse mechanisms to continue growth when zinc is limited, including the expression of zinc-independent paralogs of zinc-binding proteins. Mycobacteria have a conserved operon encoding four zinc-independent alternative ribosomal proteins (AltRPs) that are expressed when zinc is depleted. It is unknown if mycobacterial AltRPs replace their primary paralogs in the ribosome and maintain protein synthesis under zinc-limited conditions, and if such replacements contribute to their physiology. This study shows that AltRPs from &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; are essential for growth when zinc ion is scarce. Specifically, the deletion mutant of this operon (Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt;) is unable to grow in media containing a high-affinity zinc chelator, while growth of the wild type strain is unaffected under the same conditions. However, when zinc is gradually depleted during growth in zinc-limited medium, the Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; mutant maintains the same growth rate as seen for the wild type strain. In contrast to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; grown with sufficient zinc supplementation that forms shorter cells when transitioning from logarithmic to stationary phase, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; deficient for zinc elongates after the expression of AltRPs in late logarithmic phase. These zinc-depleted bacteria also exhibit a remarkable morphology characterized by a condensed chromosome, increased number of polyphosphate granules, and distinct appearance of lipid bodies and the cell wall compared to the zinc-replete cells. However, the Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; cells fail to elongate and transition into the zinc-limited morphotype, resembling the wild type zinc-replete bacteria instead. Therefore, the &lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; operon in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; has a vital role in continuation of growth when zinc is scarce and in triggering specific morphogenesis during the adaptation to zinc limitation, suggesting that AltRPs can functionally replace their zinc-dependent paralogs, but also contribute to mycobacterial physiology in a unique way.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524517200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196300</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196300</link><unread>True</unread><title>Alternative ribosomal proteins are required for growth and morphogenesis of &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium smegmatis&amp;lt;/i&gt; under zinc limiting conditions</title><updated>1524517200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196300</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba3:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196300</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allexa Dow, Sladjana Prisic&lt;/p&gt;

The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a main regulator of cell survival, proliferation, motility, and platelet aggregation, and it is essential for angiogenesis and lymphocyte trafficking. In that S1P acts as a second messenger intra- and extracellularly, it might promote cancer progression. The main cause is found in the high S1P concentration in the blood, which encourage cancer cells to migrate through the endothelial barrier into the blood vessels. The irreversible degradation of S1P is solely caused by the sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1). SGPL1 overexpression reduces cancer cell migration and therefore silences the endogenous S1P siren, which promotes cancer cell attraction—the main reason for metastasis. Since our previous metabolomics studies revealed an increased SGPL1 activity in association with successful breast cancer cell treatment &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, we further investigated expression and localization of SGPL1. Expression analyses confirmed a very low SGPL1 expression in all breast cancer samples, regardless of their subtype. Additionally, we were able to prove a novel SGPL expression in the cytoplasm membrane of non-tumorigenic breast cells by fusing three independent methods. The general SGPL1 downregulation and the loss of the plasma membrane expression resulted in S1P dependent stimulation of migration in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT-20. Not only S1P stimulated migration could be repressed by overexpressing the natural SGPL1 variant not but also more general migratory activity was significantly reduced.

The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a main regulator of cell survival, proliferation, motility, and platelet aggregation, and it is essential for angiogenesis and lymphocyte trafficking. In that S1P acts as a second messenger intra- and extracellularly, it might promote cancer progression. The main cause is found in the high S1P concentration in the blood, which encourage cancer cells to migrate through the endothelial barrier into the blood vessels. The irreversible degradation of S1P is solely caused by the sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1). SGPL1 overexpression reduces cancer cell migration and therefore silences the endogenous S1P siren, which promotes cancer cell attraction—the main reason for metastasis. Since our previous metabolomics studies revealed an increased SGPL1 activity in association with successful breast cancer cell treatment &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, we further investigated expression and localization of SGPL1. Expression analyses confirmed a very low SGPL1 expression in all breast cancer samples, regardless of their subtype. Additionally, we were able to prove a novel SGPL expression in the cytoplasm membrane of non-tumorigenic breast cells by fusing three independent methods. The general SGPL1 downregulation and the loss of the plasma membrane expression resulted in S1P dependent stimulation of migration in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT-20. Not only S1P stimulated migration could be repressed by overexpressing the natural SGPL1 variant not but also more general migratory activity was significantly reduced. Here, for the first time, we report on the SGPL1 plasma membrane location in human, non-malignant breast epithelial cell lines silencing the extracellular S1P siren &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and thereby regulating pivotal cellular functions. Loss of this plasma membrane distribution as well as low SGPL1 expression levels could be a potential prognostic marker and a viable target for therapy. Therefore, the precise role of SGPL1 for cancer treatment should be evaluated.</description><fingerprint>9f0adf67</fingerprint><author><name>Nadja Engel</name></author><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523998800000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196265</link><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: Genomic ancestry and education level independently influence abdominal fat distributions in a Brazilian admixed population</title><updated>1523998800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196265</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344174:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196265</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>476b5ff</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196265</canonicalUrl><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><crawled>1523986744698</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24213-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24213-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/UFh6YgA1X7M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1523948400000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24213-5</link><unread>True</unread><title>Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR</title><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24213-5</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24213-5</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162d2e9416e:304f582:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/UFh6YgA1X7M/s41598-018-24213-5</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24213-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24213-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Serotonin is an endogenous regulator of intestinal CYP1A1 via AhR&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/UFh6YgA1X7M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>6a1ae976</fingerprint><author><name>Christopher Manzella</name></author><crawled>1523956924782</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>112</engagement></item><item><content><content>Preprocessing of functional MRI (fMRI) involves numerous steps to clean and standardize data before statistical analysis.

Populations with obesity are more likely to fall and exhibit balance instability. The reason for this is likely multifactorial, but there is some evidence that sensory function is impaired during obesity. We tested the hypothesis that muscle proprioceptor function is compromised in a mouse model of diet induced obesity. An &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; muscle-nerve preparation was used to record muscle spindle afferent responses to physiological stretch and sinusoidal vibration. We compared the responses of C57/Bl6 male and female mice on a control diet (10% kcal fat) with those eating a high fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat) for 10 weeks (final age 14–15 weeks old). Following HFD feeding, adult mice of both sexes exhibited decreased muscle spindle afferent responses to muscle movement. Muscle spindle afferent firing rates during the plateau phase of stretch were significantly lower in both male and female HFD animals as were two measures of dynamic sensitivity (dynamic peak and dynamic index). Muscle spindle afferents in male mice on a HFD were also significantly less likely to entrain to vibration. Due to the importance of muscle spindle afferents to proprioception and motor control, decreased muscle spindle afferent responsiveness may contribute to balance instability during obesity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196832</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196832</link><unread>True</unread><title>Diet induced obesity alters muscle spindle afferent function in adult mice</title><updated>1525294800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196832</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a194:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196832</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lubayna S.

High-risk injection related behavior including use of non-sterile syringes is associated with negative health outcomes among people who inject drugs (PWID). Drug treatment programs have been reported to curb hepatitis C (HCV) transmission. This study aims to assess the role of drug treatment programs and knowledge of HCV status, and how they influence current injection-related risk. Data were collected in 2012 by the New Orleans arm of the CDC funded National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. Respondent driven sampling was used to recruit a sample of PWID. The analytic sample consisted of 473 participants. Univariate, bivariate, and linear regression analyses were performed. Findings indicated that history of drug treatment is associated with sterile syringe use among PWID. Further, knowledge of HCV status modifies the relationship between history of drug treatment and sterile syringe use in this sample. These findings highlight the importance of scaling up prevention efforts by expanding testing, counselling, and treatment for HCV among PWID who enter drug treatment facilities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196157</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196157</link><unread>True</unread><title>Knowledge of hepatitis C status moderates the relationship between history of drug treatment and sterile syringe use</title><updated>1524862800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196157</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d73e:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196157</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kiva Ariani Fisher, Laura Michele Cahill, Stephanie Broyles, Marion Rorke, William Thomas Robinson&lt;/p&gt;

Beta cell dysfunction accompanies and drives the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), but there are few clinical biomarkers available to assess islet cell stress in humans. Secretagogin, a protein enriched in pancreatic islets, demonstrates protective effects on beta cell function in animals. However, its potential as a circulating biomarker released from human beta cells and islets has not been studied. In this study primary human islets, beta cells and plasma samples were used to explore secretion and expression of secretagogin in relation to the T2D pathology. Secretagogin was abundantly and specifically expressed and secreted from human islets. Furthermore, T2D patients had an elevated plasma level of secretagogin compared with matched healthy controls, which was confirmed in plasma of diabetic mice transplanted with human islets. Additionally, the plasma secretagogin level of the human cohort had an inverse correlation to clinical assessments of beta cell function. To explore the mechanism of secretagogin release &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, human beta cells (EndoC-βH1) were exposed to elevated glucose or cellular stress-inducing agents. Secretagogin was not released in parallel with glucose stimulated insulin release, but was markedly elevated in response to endoplasmic reticulum stressors and cytokines. These findings indicate that secretagogin is a potential novel biomarker, reflecting stress and islet cell dysfunction in T2D patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196601</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196601</link><unread>True</unread><title>Secretagogin is increased in plasma from type 2 diabetes patients and potentially reflects stress and islet dysfunction</title><updated>1524862800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196601</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d754:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196601</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara F.

Background &lt;p&gt;Placental dysfunction is related to many pregnancy complications, but collecting placental specimens for investigation in large scale epidemiologic studies is often infeasible. Standard procedures involving immediate collection after birth and snap freezing are often cost prohibitive. We aimed to collect pilot data regarding the feasibility and precision of a simpler approach, the collection of tissue samples following 24 hours of refrigeration of whole placentae at 4°C, as compared to the “gold standard” of snap freezing excised tissue within 40 minutes of delivery for the assessment of inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Placentae were collected from 12 women after delivering live-born singleton babies via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Two placentae were utilized to establish laboratory tissue processing and assay protocols. The other 10 placentae were utilized in a comparison of three tissue collection conditions. Specifically, key inflammatory cytokines were measured in 3 sections, representing three collection conditions. Sections 1 (full thickness) and 2 (excised prior to freezing) were obtained within 40 minutes of delivery and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and section 3 (full thickness) was obtained after refrigerating the placenta at 4°C for 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;IL-6, IL-10, and IL-8 all had comparable concentrations and variability overall in all three section types. Levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were too low among samples to reliably measure using immunoassay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Refrigeration of placentae prior to processing does not appear to compromise detection of these cytokines for purposes of large scale studies. These findings provide a framework and preliminary data for the study of inflammatory cytokines within the placenta in large scale and/or resource-limited settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197039</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197039</link><unread>True</unread><title>Pilot study of placental tissue collection, processing, and measurement procedures for large scale assessment of placental inflammation</title><updated>1526072400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197039</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f70:2835af05</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197039</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lindsey A.

Sections 1 (full thickness) and 2 (excised prior to freezing) were obtained within 40 minutes of delivery and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and section 3 (full thickness) was obtained after refrigerating the placenta at 4°C for 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;IL-6, IL-10, and IL-8 all had comparable concentrations and variability overall in all three section types. Levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were too low among samples to reliably measure using immunoassay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Refrigeration of placentae prior to processing does not appear to compromise detection of these cytokines for purposes of large scale studies. These findings provide a framework and preliminary data for the study of inflammatory cytokines within the placenta in large scale and/or resource-limited settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>ffb28091</fingerprint><author><name>Lindsey A.

Monoamines and neuropeptides often modulate the same behavior, but monoaminergic-peptidergic crosstalk remains poorly understood. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, the adrenergic-like ligands, tyramine (TA) and octopamine (OA) require distinct subsets of neuropeptides in the two ASI sensory neurons to inhibit nociception. TA selectively increases the release of ASI neuropeptides encoded by &lt;i&gt;nlp-14&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;nlp-18&lt;/i&gt; from either synaptic/perisynaptic regions of ASI axons or the ASI soma, respectively, and OA selectively increases the release of ASI neuropeptides encoded by &lt;i&gt;nlp-9&lt;/i&gt; asymmetrically, from only the synaptic/perisynaptic region of the right ASI axon. The predicted amino acid preprosequences of genes encoding either TA- or OA-dependent neuropeptides differed markedly. However, these distinct preprosequences were not sufficient to confer monoamine-specificity and additional N-terminal peptide-encoding sequence was required.

These data demonstrate that it is important to define distinct non-bonded parameters for the protonated/deprotonated states of amino acid side chains in molecular mechanical force fields.</description><fingerprint>9e882750</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1525097669425</crawled><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Hydration_Structure_of_Methylthiolate_from_QM_MM_Molecular_Dynamics/6199340</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Floats with bio-optical sensors reveal what processes trigger the North Atlantic bloom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Floats with bio-optical sensors reveal what processes trigger the North Atlantic bloom, Published online: 04 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04181-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04181-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Floats with bio-optical sensors reveal what processes trigger the North Atlantic bloom&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/58fxfpxrfc0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525417200000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04181-0</link><unread>True</unread><title>Author Correction: Floats with bio-optical sensors reveal what processes trigger the North Atlantic bloom</title><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04181-0</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04181-0</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1632a78add9:12fc491:3dd877af</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/58fxfpxrfc0/s41467-018-04181-0</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Floats with bio-optical sensors reveal what processes trigger the North Atlantic bloom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Floats with bio-optical sensors reveal what processes trigger the North Atlantic bloom, Published online: 04 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04181-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04181-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Floats with bio-optical sensors reveal what processes trigger the North Atlantic bloom&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/58fxfpxrfc0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>60e28ad1</fingerprint><author><name>A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The inconclusive clinical results for ST-waveform analysis (STAN) in detecting fetal hypoxemia may be caused by the signal processing of the STAN-device itself. We assessed the performance of a clinical STAN device in signal processing and in detecting hypoxemia in a fetal sheep model exposed to prolonged umbilical cord occlusion (UCO).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight fetal lambs were exposed to 25 minutes of UCO. ECG recordings were analyzed during a baseline period and during UCO. STAN-event rates and timing of episodic T/QRS rise, baseline T/QRS rise and the occurrence of biphasic ST-waveforms, as well as signal loss, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During baseline conditions of normoxemia, a median of 40 (IQR, 25–70) STAN-events per minute were detected, compared to 10 (IQR, 2–22) during UCO. During UCO STAN-events were detected in five subjects within 10 minutes and in six subjects after 18 minutes, respectively. Two subjects did not generate any STAN-event during UCO. Biphasic ST event rate was reduced during UCO (median 0, IQR 0–5), compared to baseline (median 32, IQR, 6–55). ST-waveforms could not be assessed in 62% of the recording time during UCO, despite a good quality of the ECG signal.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The STAN device showed limitations in detecting hypoxemia in fetal sheep after prolonged UCO. The STAN device produced high false positive event rates during baseline and did not detect T/QRS changes adequately after prolonged fetal hypoxemia. During 14% of baseline and 62% of the UCO period, the STAN-device could not process the ECG signal, despite its good quality.

These findings elucidate the role of intra-TAD cohesin-and-CTCF binding in nuclear organization associated with widespread insulation of distal enhancer activity.</description><fingerprint>4313576c</fingerprint><keywords><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item></keywords><author><name>djw@bu.edu (Bryan J Matthews)</name></author><crawled>1526299051468</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><published>1523662234000</published><visual><url>https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0092867418303052-fx1.jpg</url><width>375</width><height>375</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><summary><content>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Ke Zhang, J.

A pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-specific receptor, PAC1R, is coupled with multiple signal transduction pathways including stimulation of adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. PAC1R has been shown to exert its long-lasting and potent signals via β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. However, the precise roles of the two β-arrestin isoforms in PACAP-PAC1R signaling remain unclear. Here we examined the interaction between the two β-arrestin isoforms and PAC1R, β-arrestin-dependent PAC1R subcellular localization and ERK1/2 activation. Upon PACAP stimulation, although PAC1R similarly interacted with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in HEK293T cells, the complex of PAC1R and β-arrestin2 was translocated from the cell surface into cytosol, but that of β-arrestin1 remained in the cell surface regions in HeLa cells and mouse primary cultured neurons. Silencing of β-arrestin2 blocked PACAP-induced PAC1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but silencing of β-arrestin1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</link><unread>True</unread><title>β-Arrestin1 and 2 differentially regulate PACAP-induced PAC1 receptor signaling and trafficking</title><updated>1525726800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42260:5785ab88</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yusuke Shintani, Atsuko Hayata-Takano, Keita Moriguchi, Takanobu Nakazawa, Yukio Ago, Atsushi Kasai, Kaoru Seiriki, Norihito Shintani, Hitoshi Hashimoto&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Although increased serum IgG4 level and tissue infiltration of IgG4-positive cells are key events in IgG4-related disease (IgG4RD), and nearly half of IgG4RD patients show hypocomplementemia, the role of IgG4 in the pathogenesis of IgG4RD remains unclear. Many reports show that altered IgG glycosylation, especially IgG with agalactosylated N-linked glycan (G0 N-glycan), have proinflammatory roles including complement activation, implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. This study determined the concentration of N-linked glycans (N-glycan) released from serum IgG4 in IgG4RD patients and compared the difference of glycosylation changes to those in healthy controls. We also compared the concentration of each IgG4 glycoform between patients with and without hypocomplementemia and individual organ involvement (kidney, pancreas, lymph node) in IgG4RD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We collected sera from 12 IgG4RD patients and 8 healthy controls. IgG4 was isolated from sera via Melon™ Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit followed by Capture Select IgG4 (Hu) Affinity Matrix. IgG4 N-glycans were analyzed by S-BIO Glycan&lt;i&gt;Map&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Xpress methodology.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significant increases of IgG4 G0 N-glycan and IgG4 fucosylated N-glycan (F1 N-glycan) concentrations were observed in IgG4RD compared with healthy controls. Although we observed decreased levels of IgG4 F0 glycan in IgG4RD with hypocomplementemia, there were no significant differences in the galactosylation and sialyation of IgG4 N-glycans. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the glycosylation of IgG4 N-glycans between patients with and without individual organ involvement of IgG4RD.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although IgG4 has anti-inflammatory properties, IgG4 G0 and F1 glycans were increased in patients with IgG4RD. Our results suggest that decreased galactosylation of IgG4 is not related to complement activation and the differences of individual organ involvement in IgG4RD. IgG4 fucosylation change may be related to complement activation in IgG4RD.

Localized maternal mRNAs play important roles in embryogenesis, e.g. the establishment of embryonic axes and the developmental cell fate specification, in various animal species. In ascidians, a group of maternal mRNAs, called &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs, is localized to a subcellular structure, called the Centrosome-Attracting Body (CAB), which contains the ascidian germ plasm, and is inherited by the germline cells during embryogenesis. Posterior end mark (Pem), a &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs member, represses somatic gene expression in the germline during cleavage stages by inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity. However, the functions of other &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/ PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs members in germline formation are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the functions of two &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs, &lt;i&gt;Popk-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Zf-1&lt;/i&gt;, in transcriptional regulation in the germline cells. We show that Popk-1 contributes to transcriptional quiescence by controlling the size of the CAB and amount of Pem protein translated at the CAB. Our studies also indicated that zygotic expression of a germline gene starts around the onset of gastrulation and that the decrease of Pem protein is necessary and sufficient for the zygotic germline gene expression. Finally, further studies showed that the decrease of the Pem protein level is facilitated by Zf-1. Taken together, we propose that &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs such as Popk-1 and Zf-1 control the protein level of the transcriptional repressor Pem and regulate its transcriptional state in the ascidian germline.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525122000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196500</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196500</link><unread>True</unread><title>Control of Pem protein level by localized maternal factors for transcriptional regulation in the germline of the ascidian, &amp;lt;i&gt;Halocynthia roretzi&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><updated>1525122000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196500</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4c:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196500</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kaori Miyaoku, Ayaki Nakamoto, Hiroki Nishida, Gaku Kumano&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Preclinical breast cancer models recapitulating the clinical course of metastatic disease are crucial for drug development. Highly metastatic cell lines forming spontaneous metastasis following orthotopic implantation were previously developed and characterized regarding their biological and histological characteristics. This study aimed to non-invasively and longitudinally characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of metastasis formation and progression in the MDA-MB-231-derived triple negative LM2-4 and HER2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LM2-4H2N cell lines, using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), fluorescence imaging, and 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET).&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;LM2-4, LM2-4H2N, and MDA-MB-231 tumors were established in the right inguinal mammary fat pad (MFP) of female SCID mice and resected 14–16 days later. Metastasis formation was monitored using BLI. Metabolic activity of primary and metastatic lesions in mice bearing LM2-4 or LM2-4H2N was assessed by [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET. Metastatic burden at study endpoint was assessed by CT and fluorescence imaging following intravenous dual-modality liposome agent administration.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Comparable temporal metastasis patterns were observed using BLI for the highly metastatic cell lines LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N, while metastasis formed about 10 days later for MDA-MB-231. 21 days post primary tumor resection, metastases were detected in 86% of LM2-4, 69% of LM2-4H2N, and 60% of MDA-MB-231 inoculated mice, predominantly in the axillary region, contralateral MFP, and liver/lung. LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N tumors displayed high metabolism based on [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake. Lung metastases were detected as the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake increased significantly between pre- and post-metastasis scan. Using a liposomal dual-modality agent, CT and fluorescence confirmed BLI detected lesions and identified additional metastatic nodules in the intraperitoneal cavity and lung.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of complementary anatomical and functional imaging techniques can provide high sensitivity characterization of metastatic disease spread, progression and overall disease burden. The described models and imaging toolset can be implemented as an effective means for quantitative treatment response evaluation in metastatic breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525381200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196892</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196892</link><unread>True</unread><title>Spatiotemporal assessment of spontaneous metastasis formation using multimodal &amp;lt;i&gt;in vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; imaging in HER2&amp;lt;sup&gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&gt; and triple negative metastatic breast cancer xenograft models in mice</title><updated>1525381200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196892</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3aea:5785ab88</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196892</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inga B.

This study aimed to non-invasively and longitudinally characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of metastasis formation and progression in the MDA-MB-231-derived triple negative LM2-4 and HER2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LM2-4H2N cell lines, using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), fluorescence imaging, and 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET).&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;LM2-4, LM2-4H2N, and MDA-MB-231 tumors were established in the right inguinal mammary fat pad (MFP) of female SCID mice and resected 14–16 days later. Metastasis formation was monitored using BLI. Metabolic activity of primary and metastatic lesions in mice bearing LM2-4 or LM2-4H2N was assessed by [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET. Metastatic burden at study endpoint was assessed by CT and fluorescence imaging following intravenous dual-modality liposome agent administration.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Comparable temporal metastasis patterns were observed using BLI for the highly metastatic cell lines LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N, while metastasis formed about 10 days later for MDA-MB-231. 21 days post primary tumor resection, metastases were detected in 86% of LM2-4, 69% of LM2-4H2N, and 60% of MDA-MB-231 inoculated mice, predominantly in the axillary region, contralateral MFP, and liver/lung. LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N tumors displayed high metabolism based on [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake. Lung metastases were detected as the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake increased significantly between pre- and post-metastasis scan. Using a liposomal dual-modality agent, CT and fluorescence confirmed BLI detected lesions and identified additional metastatic nodules in the intraperitoneal cavity and lung.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of complementary anatomical and functional imaging techniques can provide high sensitivity characterization of metastatic disease spread, progression and overall disease burden. The described models and imaging toolset can be implemented as an effective means for quantitative treatment response evaluation in metastatic breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>21f6e47a</fingerprint><author><name>Inga B.

A macromolecular complex of the enzymes involved in human &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; purine biosynthesis, the purinosome, has been shown to consist of a core assembly to regulate the metabolic activity of the pathway. However, it remains elusive whether the core assembly itself can be selectively controlled in the cytoplasm without promoting the purinosome. Here, we reveal that pharmacological inhibition of the cytoplasmic activity of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) selectively promotes the formation of the core assembly, but not the purinosome, in cancer cells. However, alternative signaling cascades that are associated with the plasma membrane-bound PDK1 activity, including Akt-mediated cascades, regulate neither the core assembly nor the purinosome in our conditions. Along with immunofluorescence microscopy and a knock-down study against PDK1 using small interfering RNAs, we reveal that cytoplasmic PDK1-associated signaling pathways regulate subcellular colocalization of three enzymes that form the core assembly of the purinosome in an Akt-independent manner. Collectively, this study reveals a new mode of compartmentalization of purine biosynthetic enzymes controlled by spatially resolved signaling pathways.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524085200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195989</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195989</link><unread>True</unread><title>Spatial alterations of &amp;lt;i&gt;De Novo&amp;lt;/i&gt; purine biosynthetic enzymes by Akt-independent PDK1 signaling pathways</title><updated>1524085200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195989</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccbf:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195989</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Danielle L.

The ability to simultaneously process and maintain multiple pieces of information is limited. Over the past 50 years, observational methods have provided a large amount of insight regarding the neural mechanisms that underpin the mental capacity that we refer to as “working memory.” More than 20 years ago, a neural coding scheme was proposed for working memory. As a result of technological developments, we can now not only observe but can also influence brain rhythms in humans. Building on these novel developments, we have begun to externally control brain oscillations in order to extend the limits of working memory.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZK-DqGkj6Do&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524171600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005867</link><recrawled>1524160804722</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>On ways to overcome the magical capacity limit of working memory</title><updated>1524171600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005867</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005867</originId><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162df0f876e:4dc26a:bdf8aaf1</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/ZK-DqGkj6Do/article</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zsolt Turi, Ivan Alekseichuk, Walter Paulus&lt;/p&gt;

Reconfigurations of synchronized large-scale networks are thought to be central neural mechanisms that support cognition and behavior in the human brain. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings together with recent advances in network analysis now allow for sub-second snapshots of such networks. In the present study, we compared frequency-resolved functional connectivity patterns underlying reading of single words and visual recognition of symbol strings. Word reading emphasized coherence in a left-lateralized network with nodes in classical perisylvian language regions, whereas symbol processing recruited a bilateral network, including connections between frontal and parietal regions previously associated with spatial attention and visual working memory. Our results illustrate the flexible nature of functional networks, whereby processing of different form categories, written words vs. symbol strings, leads to the formation of large-scale functional networks that operate at distinct oscillatory frequencies and incorporate task-relevant regions.

Reconfigurations of synchronized large-scale networks are thought to be central neural mechanisms that support cognition and behavior in the human brain. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings together with recent advances in network analysis now allow for sub-second snapshots of such networks. In the present study, we compared frequency-resolved functional connectivity patterns underlying reading of single words and visual recognition of symbol strings. Word reading emphasized coherence in a left-lateralized network with nodes in classical perisylvian language regions, whereas symbol processing recruited a bilateral network, including connections between frontal and parietal regions previously associated with spatial attention and visual working memory. Our results illustrate the flexible nature of functional networks, whereby processing of different form categories, written words vs. symbol strings, leads to the formation of large-scale functional networks that operate at distinct oscillatory frequencies and incorporate task-relevant regions. These results suggest that category-specific processing should be viewed not so much as a local process but as a distributed neural process implemented in signature networks. For words, increased coherence was detected particularly in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and high gamma (60–90 Hz) frequency bands, whereas increased coherence for symbol strings was observed in the high beta (21–29 Hz) and low gamma (30–45 Hz) frequency range. These findings attest to the role of coherence in specific frequency bands as a general mechanism for integrating stimulus-dependent information across brain regions.</description><fingerprint>a29de002</fingerprint><author><name>Mia Liljeström</name></author><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Alarmin delivery accelerates tissue regeneration by transitioning quiescent stem cells to the metabolically active G&lt;sub&gt;Alert&lt;/sub&gt; state.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525283403000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/439/eaat8523?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><title>[Editors&apos; Choice] Alerting stem cells to regenerate</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/439/eaat8523?rss=1</originId><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_163220f502f:675d2f:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/439/eaat8523?rss=1</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;Alarmin delivery accelerates tissue regeneration by transitioning quiescent stem cells to the metabolically active G&lt;sub&gt;Alert&lt;/sub&gt; state.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>4f5f643a</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/439/eaat8523.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Holloway, J.

In tomato, resistance to &lt;i&gt;Tomato spotted wilt virus&lt;/i&gt; (TSWV) is conferred by the dominant gene, designated Sw-5. Virulent Sw-5 resistance breaking (SRB) mutants of TSWV have been reported on Sw-5 tomato cultivars. Two different PCR-based allelic discrimination techniques, namely Custom TaqMan™ SNP Genotyping and high-resolution melting (HRM) assays, were developed and compared for their ability to distinguish between avirulent (Sw-5 non-infecting, SNI) and SRB biotypes. TaqMan assays proved to be more sensitive (threshold of detection in a range of 50–70 TSWV RNA copies) and more reliable than HRM, assigning 25 TSWV isolates to their correct genotype with an accuracy of 100%. Moreover, the TaqMan SNP assays were further improved developing a rapid and simple protocol that included crude leaf extraction for RNA template preparations. On the other hand, HRM assays showed higher levels of sensitivity than TaqMan when used to co-detect both biotypes in different artificial mixtures. These diagnostic assays contributed to gain preliminary information on the epidemiology of TSWV isolates in open field conditions. In fact, the presented data suggest that SRB isolates are present as stable populations established year round, persisting on both winter (globe artichoke) and summer (tomato) crops, in the same cultivated areas of Southern Italy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525122000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196738</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196738</link><unread>True</unread><title>Rapid identification of tomato Sw-5 resistance-breaking isolates of &amp;lt;i&gt;Tomato spotted wilt virus&amp;lt;/i&gt; using high resolution melting and TaqMan SNP Genotyping assays as allelic discrimination techniques</title><updated>1525122000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196738</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e61:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196738</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Valentina di Rienzo, Giovanni Bubici, Cinzia Montemurro, Fabrizio Cillo&lt;/p&gt;

We spend a lot of time thinking about proteins in terms of their primary sequence and features of their three-dimensional structure (binding pockets, recognition domains, etc.) And that’s understandable. But it’s always important not to lose sight of the fact that the surfaces of proteins are decorated with all kinds of ornaments that are vital for their function, even if they’re synthetically hard to control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief among those are phosphates, you’d have to say. Kinases, of course, phosphorylate things and phosphatases take those back off (and as is often the case in biology, those two classes of enzymes are rather unbalanced: there are a lot more specific kinases out there, compared to a relatively small number of jack-of-all-trades phosphatases). Phosphorylation state can be a powerful on/off switch on specific protein residues, but it’s worth remembering that proteins can have a whole long list of phosphoryation sites once you get past the heavy-duty ones. The number of kinase inhibitors out there is proof enough that this method of regulating protein function can be taken advantage of, but it’s worth keeping in mind that making specifically phosphorylated proteins can be a painful process if you don’t have a living cell or at least a tame enzyme to do it for you. That’s particularly true if you’re interested in one of the less-common phosphorylation sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have a very different sort of polarity modification, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenylation&quot;&gt;prenylation&lt;/a&gt;. Farnesyl (or geranyl-geranyl) groups are small lipophilic chains that get attached to proteins to modify their function and/or cellular localization. Proteins also get decorated with even longer lipid chains via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitoylation&quot;&gt;palmitoylation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myristoylation&quot;&gt;myristoylation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s believed that these are generally involved in localizing things to membrane sites (as those greasy side chains settle into the lipid membrane). What’s for sure is that these modifications can make proteins rather tricky to work with (as is generally the case when you have a big polar/nonpolar structural separation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that you get to the proteins-modified-with-other-proteins class, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin&quot;&gt;ubiquitination&lt;/a&gt; at the head of that class. Ubiquitin, as the name implies, is all over the place, and proteins get ubiquitinated (at lysine residues) to mark them for degradation, to mark them not to be degraded, to change their localization and interaction networks, and for who knows what else. It’s a huge topic, since there are lots of varieties of ubiquitin attachment, and if you think we’ve got them all figured out you are sadly mistaken. Then there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUMO_protein&quot;&gt;SUMOylation&lt;/a&gt;, another add-a-small-protein process that’s clearly important but which we understand even less. It’s less common than ubiquitination (we think!), but there are several different sorts of SUMO proteins and places that they can be attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m skipping over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification&quot;&gt;several other&lt;/a&gt; post-translational modifications to get to a big class of them that I haven’t mentioned yet: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation&quot;&gt;glycosylations&lt;/a&gt;. Sugar molecules (and chains of them) are stapled on to residues like tyrosine, starting with good old glucose and going on from there. These things can also be linked through amine and sometimes even SH residues, and that is just the beginning. I did my graduate work using carbohydrates as starting materials for organic synthesis, and anyone who’s worked with them will have some appreciation of the complications that are available. With all those open hydroxyls available, carbohydrates have a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside&quot;&gt;linking possibilities&lt;/a&gt; (some more common than others, naturally), and you have the alpha/beta anomeric centers for variety as well. Two naturally occurring amino acids can give you four peptides, but two naturally occurring sugars can give you a whole lot more disaccharides, at least in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modifications are hugely important in proteins and many other biomolecules (including small-molecule natural products), but when I was in grad school, a lot of this was, chemically and biologically speaking, dark matter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK453015/&quot;&gt;A lot of it&lt;/a&gt; still is. Sometimes people would prefer just to ignor that part – even now, you’ll see total syntheses of some natural product as “whateverol aglycon”, that is, minus those pesky sugars. And when it comes to proteins, you almost have to rely on a living cell to glycosylate them properly, because chemically it can be a beast. A lot of chemical glycosylations are variations on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koenigs%E2%80%93Knorr_reaction&quot;&gt;Koenigs-Knorr&lt;/a&gt; reaction, with glycosyl halides, pseudohalides, and other leaving groups, and the number of variations on this is surely beyond counting. Holy cow, are there ever a lot of attempts to make glycosylation a better and more predictable reaction. My old “Lowe’s Laws of the Lab List” had one that went “&lt;em&gt;When there are twenty different ways of running a reaction in the literature, it means that there is no good way to run the reaction&lt;/em&gt;“, and the Koenigs-Knorr was what I had in mind. But it’s true: every time you vary the substrate being glycosylated or mess with the structure of the sugar part in any way, you can expect to see a new mixture of alpha/beta glycosides at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper I linked to so many paragraphs ago is a good shot, though, at taming this stuff for plain glucose-style glycosylation. The authors have a glycosyl fluoride protocol worked out (calcium hydroxide turns out to be a key addition) that seems to give pretty solid results on tyrosines (and phenols in general). What’s really impressive is that it works under aqueous conditions, using an unprotected sugar, and works on native (unprotected) proteins and peptides. It’s not perfect – you still get some glycosylation on other residues (serine, etc.), but it’s certainly the best I’ve ever seen. It would be interesting to see what happens when you try it on a protein with several possible tyrosines or with competing Cys residues, and I get the impression that the authors are heading there next. But even as it stands, this looks like a significantly better option than anything else out there for fast one-step glycosylation without messing around with protecting groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sorts of tools that are available for synthesizing, manipulating, and analyzing proteins and nucleic acids are (in general) just not available for carbohydrates. They either don’t exist anywhere or haven’t been domesticated from their biochemical forms. Only in recent years has the dream of automated polysaccharide synthesis come close &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/17/E3385&quot;&gt;to reality&lt;/a&gt;. Even in this paper, it’s worth noting that the authors weren’t really able to tell what all those other minor glycosylated side products were; it would be a major effort to run all those down. But this stuff is important, and every new technique that makes it easier to work in the area is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525699324000</published><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/07/stop-ignoring-the-sugars</canonicalUrl><summary><content>This paper (from two groups at Yale’s chemistry department) addresses several important things that fall into the “important irritants” category in synthesis and molecular biology – or maybe that should be “irritatingly important”.

Jasmonates (JAs) are signalling molecules involved in stress responses, development and secondary metabolism biosynthesis, although their roles in fleshy-fruit development and ripening processes are not well known. In strawberry fruit, it has been proposed that JAs could regulate the early development through the activation of the JAs biosynthesis. Moreover, it has been reported that JA treatment increases anthocyanin content in strawberry fruit involving the bioactive jasmonate biosynthesis. Nevertheless, JA signalling pathway, of which main components are the COI1-JAZ co-receptor and the MYC transcription factors (TFs), has not been characterized in strawberry until now. Here we identified and characterized the woodland strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;) JAZ and MYC genes as well as studied their expression during development and ripening stages in commercial strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;) fruit. We described twelve putative JAZ proteins and two MYC TFs, which showed high conservation with respect to their orthologs in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and in other fleshy-fruit species such as &lt;i&gt;Malus&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;domestica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; as revealed by gene synteny and phylogenetic analyses. Noteworthy, their expression levels exhibited a significant decrease from fruit development to ripening stages in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;, along with others of the JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaNINJA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FaJAM&lt;/i&gt;s, encoding for negative regulators of JA responses. Moreover, we found that main JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaMYC2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;FaJAZ1&lt;/i&gt; are promptly induced by JA treatment at early times in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit. These results suggest the conservation of the canonical JA signalling pathway in strawberry and a possible role of this pathway in early strawberry fruit development, which also correlates negatively with the beginning of the ripening process.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197118</link><unread>True</unread><title>Jasmonate signalling pathway in strawberry: Genome-wide identification, molecular characterization and expression of &amp;lt;i&gt;JAZ&amp;lt;/i&gt;s and &amp;lt;i&gt;MYC&amp;lt;/i&gt;s during fruit development and ripening</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197118</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559151:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197118</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adrián Garrido-Bigotes, Nicolás E.

These results suggest the conservation of the canonical JA signalling pathway in strawberry and a possible role of this pathway in early strawberry fruit development, which also correlates negatively with the beginning of the ripening process.</description><fingerprint>114197ce</fingerprint><author><name>Adrián Garrido-Bigotes</name></author><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cancer: Mopping up a molecule for breast cancer survival&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer: Mopping up a molecule for breast cancer survival, Published online: 20 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.58&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cancer: Mopping up a molecule for breast cancer survival&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/grjpDPf28yE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524207600000</published><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nrd.2018.58-i1.jpg</url><width>200</width><height>318</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.58</link><unread>True</unread><title>Cancer: Mopping up a molecule for breast cancer survival</title><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.58</href></item></canonical><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.58</originId><id>YLwIhSxZAzQIEnJq1FGGcXUQMCbQUlr9cyNMExMVeyY=_162e175c078:47aa8b6:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/grjpDPf28yE/nrd.2018.58</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cancer: Mopping up a molecule for breast cancer survival&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer: Mopping up a molecule for breast cancer survival, Published online: 20 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.58&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cancer: Mopping up a molecule for breast cancer survival&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/grjpDPf28yE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>6f91e392</fingerprint><author><name>Megan Cully</name></author><crawled>1524201013368</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><published>1523577600000</published><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34353</canonicalUrl><summary><content>Microtubules (MTs) are key components of the cytoskeleton and play a central role in cell division and development.

&lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&lt;/i&gt; (Bge.) Sok and &lt;i&gt;Cerasus glandulosa&lt;/i&gt; (Thunb.) Lois are economically important fruit-producing shrubs. Although these two species have similar looking fruits, their fruit organic acid contents differ drastically. In this study, we focused on comparing the organic acid content, activity of enzymes gene expression involved in organic acid metabolism in both &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glandulosa&lt;/i&gt; fruits. To investigate the differences of organic acid metabolism in fruits of these two species, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed. Our results showed that temporal changes of two main organic acids exhibited different trends in these two species. Transcriptome sequencing of developing &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glandulosa&lt;/i&gt; fruits systematically revealed 6,594 differentially expressed genes. Compared with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;, the expression levels of 3,469 and 3,125 genes were up- and down-regulated in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glandulosa&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, including one PEPC gene, 12 malic acid metabolism genes, 25 citric acid cycle genes, and 194 NAD/NADP metabolism genes. The correlation analysis and principal component analysis of gene expression, enzymatic activity and organic acid content showed that differences in the expression of genes encoding the NAD-malate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;NAD-MDH&lt;/i&gt;) and NADP-malate enzyme (&lt;i&gt;NADP-ME&lt;/i&gt;) contributed substantially to the observed differences in organic acid accumulation of two species. Our results provide a solid foundation for future elucidation of key mechanisms regulating organic acid biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glandulosa&lt;/i&gt; fruits and could lead to efficient and highly targeted generation of more commercially accepted cultivars.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524776400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196537</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196537</link><unread>True</unread><title>Comparison of fruit organic acids and metabolism-related gene expression between &amp;lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&amp;lt;/i&gt; (Bge.)

Background &lt;p&gt;Chromogranin A (CgA) is a plasma biomarker widely used in the follow-up of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). However, its accuracy as a tumor biomarker is relatively low because plasma CgA can increase also in patients with other diseases or in subjects treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), a class of widely-used drugs.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the attempt to identify a more reliable biomarker for NENs, we investigated, by ELISA, the circulating levels of full-length CgA (CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt;) and of various CgA-derived fragments in 17 patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs, 10 healthy controls, and 21 healthy volunteers before and after treatment with PPIs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs showed increased plasma levels of total-CgA and CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-76&lt;/sub&gt; fragment (vasostatin-1, VS-1) compared to controls [median (25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-percentiles); total-CgA: 1.85 nM (1.01–4.28) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.75 nM (0.52–0.89), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004; VS-1: 2.76 nM (1.09–7.10) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.29 nM (0.26–0.32), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, respectively], but not of CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt; or CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-373&lt;/sub&gt; fragment. VS-1 positively correlated with total-CgA (r = 0.65, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The Receiver Operating Characteristic area under the curve was 0.9935 for VS-1 and 0.8824 for total-CgA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.067). Treatment of patients with somatostatin analogues decreased both total-CgA and VS-1. In contrast, administration of PPIs increased the plasma levels of total-CgA, but not of VS-1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that plasma VS-1 is a novel biomarker for ileal and pancreatic NENs. Considering that VS-1 is a well-defined fragment not induced by proton-pump inhibitors, this polypeptide might represent a biomarker for NENs diagnosis and follow-up more accurate and easier to standardize than CgA.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525381200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196858</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196858</link><unread>True</unread><title>Vasostatin-1: A novel circulating biomarker for ileal and pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms</title><updated>1525381200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196858</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3ae3:5785ab88</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196858</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Corsello, Luigi Di Filippo, Sara Massironi, Federica Sileo, Anna Dolcetta Capuzzo, Marco Gemma, Claudia Carlucci, Claudio Cusini, Barbara Colombo, Alice Dallatomasina, Giulia Maria Franchi, Angelo Corti, Marco Federico Manzoni&lt;/p&gt;

Considering that VS-1 is a well-defined fragment not induced by proton-pump inhibitors, this polypeptide might represent a biomarker for NENs diagnosis and follow-up more accurate and easier to standardize than CgA.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>44a5a731</fingerprint><author><name>Andrea Corsello</name></author><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ankita Sarkar, Neha Gogia, Kevin Farley, Lydia Payton, Amit Singh&lt;/p&gt;
The ability to express a gene of interest in a spatio-temporal manner using Gal4-UAS system has allowed the use of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; model to study various biological phenomenon. During &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; eye development, a synchronous wave of differentiation called Morphogenetic furrow (MF) initiates at the posterior margin resulting in differentiation of retinal neurons. This synchronous differentiation is also observed in the differentiating retina of vertebrates. Since MF is highly dynamic, it can serve as an excellent model to study patterning and differentiation. However, there are not any Gal4 drivers available to observe the gain- of- function or loss- of- function of a gene specifically along the dynamic MF. The &lt;i&gt;decapentaplegic (dpp)&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes a secreted protein of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily that expresses at the posterior margin and then moves with the MF. However, unlike the MF associated pattern of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; gene expression, the targeted &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver expression is restricted to the posterior margin of the developing eye disc. We screened GMR lines harboring regulatory regions of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; fused with Gal4 coding region to identify MF specific enhancer of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; using a GFP reporter gene. We employed immuno-histochemical approaches to detect gene expression. The rationale was that GFP reporter expression will correspond to the &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; expression domain in the developing eye. We identified two new &lt;i&gt;dpp-&lt;/i&gt;Gal4 lines, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 and &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 that carry sequences from first intron region of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; gene. &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 drives expression along the MF during development and later in the entire pupal retina whereas &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 drives expression of GFP transgene in the entire developing eye disc, which later drives expression only in the ventral half of the pupal retina. Thus, &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 will serve as a new reagent for targeting gene expression in the ventral half of the pupal retina. We compared misexpression phenotypes of Wg, a negative regulator of eye development, using &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4, &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 with existing &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver. The eye phenotypes generated by using our newly identified MF specific driver are not similar to the ones generated by existing &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver. It suggests that misexpression studies along MF needs revisiting using the new Gal4 drivers generated in our studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196365</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196365</link><unread>True</unread><title>Characterization of a morphogenetic furrow specific Gal4 driver in the developing &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila&amp;lt;/i&gt; eye</title><updated>1524862800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196365</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d746:fc1f8953</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196365</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ankita Sarkar, Neha Gogia, Kevin Farley, Lydia Payton, Amit Singh&lt;/p&gt;

Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</link><unread>True</unread><title>Local dynamic stability during gait for predicting falls in elderly people: A one-year prospective study</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914d:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lucia Bizovska, Zdenek Svoboda, Miroslav Janura, Maria Cristina Bisi, Nicolas Vuillerme&lt;/p&gt;

While food losses (foods which were intended for human consumption, but which ultimately are not directly eaten by people) have been included in animal feed for millennia, the practice is all but banned in the European Union. Amid recent calls to promote a circular economy, we conducted a survey of pig farmers (n = 82) and other agricultural stakeholders (n = 81) at a UK agricultural trade fair on their attitudes toward the use of food losses in pig feed, and the potential relegalisation of swill (the use of cooked food losses as feed). While most respondents found the use of feeds containing animal by-products or with the potential for intra-species recycling (i.e. pigs eating pork products) to be less acceptable than feeds without, we found strong support (&gt;75%) for the relegalisation of swill among both pig farmers and other stakeholders. We fit multi-hierarchical Bayesian models to understand people’s position on the relegalisation of swill, finding that respondents who were concerned about disease control and the perception of the pork industry supported relegalisation less, while people who were concerned with farm financial performance and efficiency or who thought that swill would benefit the environment and reduce trade-deficits, were more supportive. Our results provide a baseline estimate of support amongst the large-scale pig industry for the relegalisation of swill, and suggest that proponents for its relegalisation must address concerns about disease control and the consumer acceptance of swill-fed pork.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524603600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196288</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196288</link><unread>True</unread><title>Support amongst UK pig farmers and agricultural stakeholders for the use of food losses in animal feed</title><updated>1524603600000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196288</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa7:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196288</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erasmus K.

Aims &lt;p&gt;Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), secreted primarily by atrial cardiomyocytes, decreases blood pressure by raising cyclic 3’,5’-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels and inducing vasorelaxation, natriuresis, and diuresis. Raising the level of ANP has been shown to be an effective treatment for hypertension. To advance the future development of an anti-microRNA (miR) approach to increasing expression of ANP, we investigated the regulation of &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression by two miRs: miR-425 and miR-155. We examined whether miR-425 and miR-155 have an additive effect on the expression and function of ANP.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) were transfected with miR-425, miR-155, or a combination of the two miRs. Two days later, &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression was measured using real time qPCR. Each of the miRs decreased &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression over a wide range of concentrations, with a significant reduction at concentrations as low as 1 nM. The combination of miR-425 and miR-155 reduced &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression to a greater extent than either miR-425 or miR-155 alone. An &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay was developed to study the potential biological significance of the miR-induced decrease in &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression. The cooperative effect of miR-425 and miR-155 on &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression was associated with a significant decrease in cGMP levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that miR-425 and miR-155 regulate &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression in a cooperative manner. Targeting both miRNAs with anti-miRs (possibly at submaximal concentrations) might prove to be a more effective strategy to modulate ANP levels, and thus blood pressure, than targeting either miRNA alone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524776400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196697</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196697</link><unread>True</unread><title>MicroRNA-425 and microRNA-155 cooperatively regulate atrial natriuretic peptide expression and cGMP production</title><updated>1524776400000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196697</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefc6:11c251fd</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196697</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Vandenwijngaert, Clara D.

To advance the future development of an anti-microRNA (miR) approach to increasing expression of ANP, we investigated the regulation of &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression by two miRs: miR-425 and miR-155. We examined whether miR-425 and miR-155 have an additive effect on the expression and function of ANP.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) were transfected with miR-425, miR-155, or a combination of the two miRs. Two days later, &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression was measured using real time qPCR. Each of the miRs decreased &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression over a wide range of concentrations, with a significant reduction at concentrations as low as 1 nM. The combination of miR-425 and miR-155 reduced &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression to a greater extent than either miR-425 or miR-155 alone. An &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay was developed to study the potential biological significance of the miR-induced decrease in &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression. The cooperative effect of miR-425 and miR-155 on &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression was associated with a significant decrease in cGMP levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that miR-425 and miR-155 regulate &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression in a cooperative manner. Targeting both miRNAs with anti-miRs (possibly at submaximal concentrations) might prove to be a more effective strategy to modulate ANP levels, and thus blood pressure, than targeting either miRNA alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>82e9e97e</fingerprint><author><name>Sara Vandenwijngaert</name></author><crawled>1524765422632</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/1096987x/39/17&quot;&gt;Volume 39, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, Page i-i, June 30, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525850843000</published><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 17, Page i-i, June 30, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25357?af=R</link><unread>True</unread><title>Cover Image, Volume 39, Issue 17</title><origin><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25357?af=R</originId><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1636067cc1a:32b4e79:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25357?af=R</href></item></alternate><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 17, Page i-i, June 30, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><fingerprint>daca9c64</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1526330805274</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Write fiction to discover something new in your research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write fiction to discover something new in your research, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05089-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05089-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Creative writing can help you to approach your science from a completely different perspective — and boost its impact, says Amanda C.

MRL/MpJ mice have abundant ovarian mast cells (MCs) as compared with other strains at postnatal day 0 (P0); however, they sharply decrease after birth. These ovarian MCs, particularly beneath the ovarian surface epithelium (SE), which express mucosal MC (MMC) marker, might participate in early follicular development. This study investigated the changes in spatiotemporal distribution of MCs in the perinatal MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. At P0 to P7, the MCs were densely localized to the ovary, especially their caudomedial region around the ovary-fimbria connection. The neonatal ovarian MCs showed intermediate characteristics of MMC and connective tissue MC (CTMC), and the latter phenotype became evident with aging. However, the expression ratio of the MMC to CTMC marker increased from P0 to P4 in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovary. Similarly, the ratio of MCs facing SE to total MC number increased with aging, although the number of ovarian MCs decreased, indicating the relative increase in MMC phenotypes in the early neonatal ovary. Neither proliferating nor apoptotic MCs were found in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. The parenchymal cells surrounding MCs at ovary-fimbria connection showed similar molecular expression patterns (E-cadherin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Foxl2&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/Gata4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as that of the ovarian surface epithelial cells. At P2, around the ovary-fimbria connection, c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; immature oocytes formed clusters called nests, and some MCs localized adjacent to c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; oocytes within the nests. These results indicated that in postnatal MRL/MpJ mice, ovarian MCs changed their distribution by migrating toward the parenchymal cells composing ovary-fimbria connection, which possessed similar characteristics to the ovarian surface epithelium. Thus, we elucidated the spatiotemporal alterations of the ovarian MCs in MRL/MpJ mice, and suggested their importance during the early follicular development by migrating toward the ovary-fimbria connection. MRL/MpJ mice would be useful to elucidate the relationship between neonatal immunity and reproductive systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524517200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196364</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196364</link><unread>True</unread><title>Ovarian mast cells migrate toward ovary-fimbria connection in neonatal MRL/MpJ mice</title><updated>1524517200000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196364</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba8:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196364</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Teppei Nakamura, Masataka Chihara, Osamu Ichii, Saori Otsuka-Kanazawa, Ken-ichi Nagasaki, Yaser Hosny Ali Elewa, Osamu Tatsumi, Yasuhiro Kon&lt;/p&gt;

Little is known about people’s ability to detect subclinical psychopathy from others’ quotidian social behavior, or about the correlates of variation in this ability. This study sought to address these questions using a thin slice personality judgment paradigm. We presented 108 undergraduate judges (70.4% female) with 1.5 minute video thin slices of zero-acquaintance triadic conversations among other undergraduates (targets: n = 105, 57.1% female). Judges completed self-report measures of general trust, caution, and empathy. Target individuals had completed the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy (LSRP) scale. Judges viewed the videos in one of three conditions: complete audio, silent, or audio from which semantic content had been removed using low-pass filtering. Using a novel other-rating version of the LSRP, judges’ ratings of targets’ primary psychopathy levels were significantly positively associated with targets’ self-reports, but only in the complete audio condition. Judge general trust and target LSRP interacted, such that judges higher in general trust made less accurate judgments with respect to targets higher in primary and total psychopathy. Results are consistent with a scenario in which psychopathic traits are maintained in human populations by negative frequency dependent selection operating through the costs of detecting psychopathy in others.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196729</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196729</link><unread>True</unread><title>General trust impedes perception of self-reported primary psychopathy in thin slices of social interaction</title><updated>1525294800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196729</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a189:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196729</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joseph H.

There is evidence that altering stress mindset—the belief that stress is enhancing vs. debilitating—can change cognitive, affective and physiological responses to stress. However individual differences in responsiveness to stress mindset manipulations have not been explored. Given the previously established role of catecholamines in both placebo effects and stress, we hypothesized that genetic variation in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines, would moderate responses to an intervention intended to alter participants’ mindsets about stress. Participants (N = 107) were exposed to a stress mindset manipulation (videos highlighting either the enhancing or debilitating effects of stress) prior to engaging in a Trier Social Stress task and subsequent cognitive tasks. The associations of the &lt;i&gt;COMT&lt;/i&gt; rs4680 polymorphism with the effect of stress mindset video manipulations on cognitive and affective responses were examined. Genetic variation at rs4680 modified the effects of stress mindset on affective and cognitive responses to stress. Individuals homozygous for rs4680 low-activity allele (met/met) were responsive to the stress-is-enhancing mindset manipulation as indicated by greater increases in positive affect, improved cognitive functioning, and happiness bias in response to stress. Conversely, individuals homozygous for the high-activity allele (val/val) were not as responsive to the stress mindset manipulation. These results suggest that responses to stress mindset intervention may vary with &lt;i&gt;COMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype. These findings contribute to the understanding of gene by environment interactions for mindset interventions and stress reactivity and therefore warrant further investigations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524258000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195883</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195883</link><unread>True</unread><title>Catechol-O-Methyltransferase moderates effect of stress mindset on affect and cognition</title><updated>1524258000000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195883</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fa:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195883</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alia J.

Applying such methods to similar independent datasets should yield reproducible inter-series outputs, though it was never demonstrated yet. Here we systematically test state-of-art methods of matrix factorization on several transcriptomic datasets of the same cancer type. Inspired by concepts of evolutionary bioinformatics, we design a new framework based on Reciprocally Best Hit (RBH) graphs in order to benchmark reproducibility. We show that a particular protocol of application of Independent Component Analysis (ICA), accompanied by a stabilisation procedure, leads to a significant increase in the inter-series output reproducibility. Moreover, we show that the signals detected through this method are systematically more interpretable than those of other state-of-art methods.

Applying such methods to similar independent datasets should yield reproducible inter-series outputs, though it was never demonstrated yet. Here we systematically test state-of-art methods of matrix factorization on several transcriptomic datasets of the same cancer type. Inspired by concepts of evolutionary bioinformatics, we design a new framework based on Reciprocally Best Hit (RBH) graphs in order to benchmark reproducibility. We show that a particular protocol of application of Independent Component Analysis (ICA), accompanied by a stabilisation procedure, leads to a significant increase in the inter-series output reproducibility.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to generate an ultrasonic nanobubble (NB)-mediated purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)/fludarabine suicide gene system for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;NBs were prepared from a mixture the phospholipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DPPA), perfluoropropane gas and other materials using the high shear dispersion method. NBs treated with ultrasound irradiation functioned as a gene-transfer system, and a self-constructed suicide gene expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP, treated with fludarabine functioned as a therapeutic gene. This system was used to determine the cytotoxic effects of PNP/fludarabine on HepG2 cells and SMMC7721 cells.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1. NBs with a small diameter (208–416 nm) and at a high concentration and fine homogeneity were prepared under the optimal method. 2. The pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP plasmid was efficiently transfected into HCC cells using ultrasonic NBs. 3. At 0.75μg/ml fludarabine, PNP/fludarabine showed marked cytotoxic effects toward HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. PNP/fludarabine achieved the same effect against both SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells but at a lower concentration of fludarabine for the latter. 4. Bystander effects: a 10–20% decrease in the cell survival rate was observed when only 5–10% of transfected cells were PNP positive.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;NBs constitute a non-toxic, stable and effective gene-delivery platform. The PNP/fludarabine suicide gene system inhibited the growth of HCC cells, induced HCC cell apoptosis, and caused a notable bystander effect at a low fludarabine concentration. This study establishes an important new method for miniaturizing microbubbles and improving a new NB-mediated approach for gene therapy of HCC.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</link><unread>True</unread><title>An ultrasonic nanobubble-mediated PNP/fludarabine suicide gene system: A new approach for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma</title><updated>1525294800000</updated><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a185:93d646dc</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Zhang, Mingna Chen, Youming Zhang, Wei Chen, Lihua Zhang, Lv Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a popular method for measuring transcript abundance. The most commonly used method of interpretation is relative quantification and thus necessitates the use of normalization controls (i.e. reference genes) to standardize transcript abundance. The most popular gene targets for RT-qPCR are housekeeping genes because they are thought to maintain a static transcript level among a variety of samples. However, more recent studies have shown, several housekeeping genes are not reliably stable. This is the first study to examine the potential of several reference genes for use in RT-qPCR normalization during barley malting. The process of malting barley mechanizes the imbibition and subsequent germination of barley seeds under controlled conditions. Malt quality is controlled by many pleiotropic genes that are determined by examining the result of physiological changes the barley seed undergoes during the malting process. We compared the stability of 13 reference genes across both two-and six-row malting barleys (Conrad and Legacy, respectfully) throughout the entirety of the malting process. Initially, primer target specificity, amplification efficiency and average Ct values were determined for each of the selected primer pairs. Three statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to rank the stability of each reference gene. Rankings were similar between the two- and six-row with the exception of BestKeeper’s ranking of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;). A consensus ranking among programs was determined using RefFinder. Our results show that Actin (A&lt;i&gt;CT&lt;/i&gt;) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (&lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) were the most stable throughout micromalting, while &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and Cyclophilin (&lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) were the least stable.
