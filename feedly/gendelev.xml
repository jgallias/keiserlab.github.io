Production of the iron regulatory peptide hepcidin is tightly controlled by a network of proteins in hepatocytes that sense levels of iron in the circulation (as diferric-transferrin) and in tissues (in ferritin). Human studies show high variability in the normal range of serum hepcidin levels. We have postulated that this may, in part, be related to inter-individual variability in the expression of genes in the iron sensing pathway, potentially governed by epigenetic factors. Here, we have investigated whether genes encoding hepatic iron sensing proteins and hepcidin are regulated by DNA methylation. Experiments were performed on two human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells. Basal expression of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in Huh7 cells compared with HepG2 cells. Analysis of bisulphite-converted DNA from Huh7 cells revealed partial methylation of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; (alpha transcript), which could result in gene silencing. Demethylation using 5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine (AZA) increased &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7. PCR analysis of bisulphite-converted &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; promoter DNA, using methylation-specific primers, revealed no differences between cell lines. However, &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7 was increased by AZA treatment, suggesting that methylation of one or more iron sensing genes may indirectly influence &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; expression. Our study provides evidence that DNA methylation might control expression of &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; and other hepatic iron sensing genes, and indicates that epigenetic influences on iron homeostasis warrant further investigation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526590800000</published><updated>1526590800000</updated><fingerprint>c9382993</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197863</link><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8544e:93d646dc</id><author><name>Paul A.

The present work set out to search for a virulence repertoire distinctive for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; causing primitive acute pyelonephritis (APN). To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;, but a lower prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cnf1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;kpsMT-II&lt;/i&gt;. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a higher proportion of two gene clusters (&lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt;) were detected in the APN and RC groups than in CO, whereas &lt;i&gt;iutA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; clusters were detected more frequently in APN strains. The motility level did not differ among the study-groups and phylogroups considered, although a higher proportion of swarming strains was observed in APN strains. Antibiotic-resistance rates were generally low except for ampicillin (37.7%), and were not associated with specific study- or phylogenetic groups. APN and RC strains produced more biofilm than CO strains.

For nearly a century, conventional microbiological methods have been standard practice for detecting and identifying pathogens in food. Nevertheless, the microbiological safety of food has improved and various rapid methods have been developed to overcome the limitations of conventional methods. Alternative methods are expected to detect low cell numbers, since the presence in food of even a single cell of a pathogenic organism may be infectious. With respect to low population levels, the performance of a detection method is assessed by producing serial dilutions of a pure bacterial suspension to inoculate representative food matrices with highly diluted bacterial cells (fewer than 10 CFU/ml). The accuracy of data obtained by multiple dilution techniques is not certain and does not exclude some colonies arising from clumps of cells. Micromanipulation techniques to capture and isolate single cells from environmental samples were introduced more than 40 years ago. The main limitation of the current micromanipulation technique is still the low recovery rate for the growth of a single cell in culture medium. In this study, we describe a new single cell isolation method and demonstrate that it can be used successfully to grow various types of microorganism from picked individual cells. Tests with Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including cocci, rods, aerobes, anaerobes, yeasts and molds showed growth recovery rates from 60% to 100% after micromanipulation. We also highlight the use of our method to evaluate and challenge the detection limits of standard detection methods in food samples contaminated by a single cell of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>1e5c0024</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198208</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b948:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Marisa Hohnadel</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marisa Hohnadel, Myriam Maumy, Renaud Chollet&lt;/p&gt;

As a crucial living environment, the Internet shapes cognition. The Internet provides massive information that can be accessed quickly via hyperlinks, but the information is typically fragmentary and concrete rather than integrative. According to construal level theory, the processing of this concrete and fragmentary information, should reduce attentional scope. Two experiments were conducted to test this hypothesis. In Experiment 1, three groups of participants were asked to shop online, read magazines or have a rest respectively, and a divided attention Navon-letter task was employed to measure the attentional scope before and after the assigned activity. It was found that the difference between reaction times in response to local vs. global targets was decreased only after Internet use, while there was no decrease in either the reading or resting group. In Experiment 2, the same procedure was used, and EEG/ERP methods were used to record both behavioral response and neural activity. Results showed that before the assigned activity, there was no significant difference in N2 amplitude in response to local vs. global targets in any of the three groups; during the activity, the lower-alpha activity induced by Internet use was significantly lower than that induced by reading or resting; after the activity, correspondingly, a more negative N2 wave was induced by the global than local targets only in the Internet group, while there were no significant differences in the other groups. Consistent with construal level theory, the results suggest that when surfing the Internet, attentional scope is reduced, and this effect might continue after Internet activity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>ad958418</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198543</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0b2:2835af05</id><author><name>Ming Peng</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ming Peng, Xianke Chen, Qingbai Zhao, Zongkui Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Primary brain microvessels (BrMV) maintain the cellular characters and molecular signatures as displayed in vivo, and serve as a vital tool for biomedical research of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the development/optimization of brain drug delivery. The variations of relative purities or cellular composition among different BrMV samples may have significant consequences in data interpretation and research outcome, especially for experiments with high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable reference gene (RG) for accurate normalization of real-time RT-qPCR analysis, and determine the proper marker genes (MG) for relative purity assessment in BrMV samples. Out of five housekeeping genes, β-actin was selected as the most suitable RG that was validated by quantifying mRNA levels of alpha-L-iduronidase in BrMV isolated from mice with one or two expressing alleles. Four marker genes highly/selectively expressed in BBB-forming capillary endothelial cells were evaluated by RT-qPCR for purity assessment, resulting in &lt;i&gt;Cldn&lt;/i&gt;5 and &lt;i&gt;Pecam1&lt;/i&gt; as most suitable MGs that were further confirmed by immunofluorescent analysis of cellular components. &lt;i&gt;Plvap&lt;/i&gt; proved to be an indicator gene for the presence of fenestrated vessels in BrMV samples.

This study may contribute to the building blocks toward overarching research needs on the blood-brain barrier.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029373?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Conformational explosion: Understanding the complexity of short chain para-dialkylbenzene potential energy surfaces</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029373?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525848665000</published><fingerprint>a8b38277</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029373?af=R</link><crawled>1526282826472</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1635d8bb2e8:2d2ccba:3dd877af</id><author><name>Piyush Mishra</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335851v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>In-Search Selection of Monoisotopic Peaks Improves the Identification of Cross-Linked Peptides [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/31/335851</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335851v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Cross-linking/mass spectrometry (CLMS) has gone through a maturation process similar to standard proteomics by adapting key methods such as false discovery rate control and quantification.

Background &lt;p&gt;Modifiable risk factors such as smoking and sedentary lifestyle adversely affect multiple sclerosis (MS) progression. Few multimodal behavioural interventions have been conducted for people with MS, and follow-up beyond 1 year is rare for lifestyle interventions. This study assessed adoption and adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviours and health outcomes 3 years after a lifestyle modification intervention, using generalized estimating equation models to account for within-participant correlation over time.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;95 people with MS completed baseline surveys before participating in 5-day MS lifestyle risk-factor modification workshops. 76 and 78 participants completed the 1-year and 3-year follow-up surveys respectively. Mean age at 3-year follow-up was 47 years, 72% were female, most (62.8%) had MS for 5 years or less, and 73% had relapsing remitting MS (RRMS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to baseline, participants reported clinically meaningful increases in physical (mean difference (MD): 8.0, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 5.2–10.8) and mental health (MD: 9.2, CI: 5.8–12.6) quality of life (QOL) at 1-year, and physical (MD: 8.7, CI: 5.3–12.2) and mental health (MD: 8.0, CI: 4.2–11.8) QOL at 3-year follow-up. There was a small decrease in disability from baseline to 1-year follow-up (MD: 0.9, CI: 0.9,1.0) and to 3-year follow-up (MD: 1.0, CI: 0.9,1.0), which was not clinically meaningful. Of those with RRMS, compared to baseline, fewer had a relapse during the year before 1-year follow-up (OR: 0.1, CI 0.0–0.2) and 3-year follow-up (OR: 0.15, CI 0.06–0.33). Participants’ healthy diet score, the proportion meditating ≥1 hours a week, supplementing with ≥ 5000IU vitamin D daily, and supplementing with omega-3 flaxseed oil increased at 1-year follow-up and was sustained, although slightly lower at 3-year follow-up. However, there was no evidence for a change in physical activity and not enough smokers to make meaningful comparisons. Medication use increased at 1-year follow-up and at 3-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results provide evidence that lifestyle risk factor modification is feasible and sustainable over time, in a small self-selected and motivated sample of people with MS. Furthermore, participation in a lifestyle intervention is not associated with a decrease in MS medication use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>ce4d5aaa</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197759</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2337:2835af05</id><author><name>Claudia H.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Spatial targeting is advocated as an effective method that contributes for achieving tuberculosis control in high-burden countries. However, there is a paucity of studies clarifying the spatial nature of the disease in these countries. This study aims to identify the location, size and risk of purely spatial and space-time clusters for high occurrence of tuberculosis in Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia during 2007 to 2016.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 15,805 patient data that were retrieved from unit TB registers were included in the final analyses. The spatial and space-time cluster analyses were performed using the global Moran’s &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;, Getis-Ord Gi* and Kulldorff’s scan statistics.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eleven purely spatial and three space-time clusters were detected (&lt;i&gt;P &lt;/i&gt;0.001).The clusters were concentrated in border areas of the Gurage Zone. There were considerable spatial variations in the risk of tuberculosis by year during the study period.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study showed that tuberculosis clusters were mainly concentrated at border areas of the Gurage Zone during the study period, suggesting that there has been sustained transmission of the disease within these locations.

Background &lt;p&gt;Both osteoarticular tuberculosis (OA-TB) and inflammatory arthritis can lead to osteoarticular structural damage. These conditions exhibit similar symptoms, physical signs, and imaging features. Rapidly and accurately diagnosing OA-TB in patients with inflammatory arthritis presents a challenge to clinicians. Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a rapid diagnostic tool for diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. This study was designed to investigate diagnostic efficiency of Xpert for OA-TB in patients with inflammatory arthritis in China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 83 consecutive patients with inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB were enrolled prospectively from June 2014 to May 2018. Demographic, clinical, and biological data were recorded. Xpert assay, smear microscopy examination (smear), BACTEC MGIT 960 (MGIT 960), pathological examination, and T-SPOT.TB test were performed for each patient who received operations. Diagnostic efficiency of Xpert was evaluated based on a composite reference standard (CRS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 49 out of 83 patients with inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB received operations, and 49 specimens were obtained during operations. According to CRS, 36 out of 49 patients with inflammatory arthritis were diagnosed with OA-TB, and 13 were not affected by the condition. Sensitivity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 960, pathological examination, and T-SPOT.TB test reached 66.70% (24/36), 25.00% (9/36), 30.55% (11/36), 47.22% (17/36), and 80.55% (29/36), respectively. Specificity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 960, and pathological examination was all 100% (13/13). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB test was 53.84% (7/13). Sensitivity of Xpert was higher than that of smear, MGIT 960 and pathological examination, but the sensitivity of Xpert was lower than that of T-SPOT.TB. Sensitivity of Xpert was statistically different from that of smear and MGIT 960 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), but the sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.096, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.181). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB was less than that of Xpert, smear, MGIT 960, and pathological examination, and the difference between them was statistically significant (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015). Among the 27 OA-TB patients with smear negative results, Xpert had the highest sensitivity, but sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.413, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.783). 2 of 36 OA-TB patients exhibited RIF resistance. Xpert was concordant with MGIT 960-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) in detecting rifampin (RIF) resistance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Xpert is an efficient tool with high sensitivity and specificity for OA-TB diagnosis in patients with inflammatory arthritis in high-TB prevalence countries. Compared with conventional methods, Xpert has two advantages: one is fast, and the other is able to provide RIF resistance information simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>534593af</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198600</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a8455e:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Yuan Li</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Li, Wenyun Jia, Guohua Lei, Dan Zhao, Guirong Wang, Shibing Qin&lt;/p&gt;

Compared with conventional methods, Xpert has two advantages: one is fast, and the other is able to provide RIF resistance information simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5832.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Revisiting sources of left-handedness in multiple-birth individuals [Psychological and Cognitive Sciences]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5832</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5832.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Multiple births have been celebrated by many couples, yet they pose moderate to severe physical hazards to both mothers and infants, one being infants’ lower birthweight relative to nontwins.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established primary treatment for newly diagnosed brain metastases with high local control rates. However, data about local re-irradiation in case of local failure after SRS (re-SRS) are rare. We evaluated the feasibility, efficacy and patient selection characteristics in treating locally recurrent metastases with a second course of SRS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively evaluated patients with brain metastases treated with re-SRS for local tumor progression between 2011 and 2017. Patient and treatment characteristics as well as rates of tumor control, survival and toxicity were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 32 locally recurrent brain metastases in 31 patients were irradiated with re-SRS. Median age at re-SRS was 64.9 years. The primary histology was breast cancer and non-small-cellular lung cancer (NSCLC) in respectively 10 cases (31.3%), in 5 cases malignant melanoma (15.6%). In the first SRS-course 19 metastases (59.4%) and in the re-SRS-course 29 metastases (90.6%) were treated with CyberKnife&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and the others with Gamma Knife. Median planning target volume (PTV) for re-SRS was 2.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (range, 0.1–37.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and median dose prescribed to the PTV was 19 Gy (range, 12–28 Gy) in 1–5 fractions to the median 69% isodose (range, 53–80%). The 1-year overall survival rate was 61.7% and the 1-year local control rate was 79.5%. The overall rate of radiological radio-necrosis was 16.1% and four patients (12.9%) experienced grade ≥ 3 toxicities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases after prior local SRS appears to be feasible with acceptable toxicity and can be considered as salvage treatment option for selected patients with high performance status. Furthermore, this is the first study utilizing robotic radiosurgery for this indication, as an additional option for frameless fractionated treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>c4f39229</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198692</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f59:2835af05</id><author><name>Panagiotis Balermpas</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Panagiotis Balermpas, Susanne Stera, Jens Müller von der Grün, Britta Loutfi-Krauss, Marie-Thérèse Forster, Marlies Wagner, Christian Keller, Claus Rödel, Volker Seifert, Oliver Blanck, Robert Wolff&lt;/p&gt;

Animal diseases are global issues affecting the productivity and financial profitability of affected farms. Johne’s disease is distributed on farms worldwide and is an endemic contagious bacterial infection in ruminants caused by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium avium&lt;/i&gt; subspecies &lt;i&gt;paratuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;. In cattle, the clinical disease manifests itself as chronic enteritis resulting in reduced production, weight loss, and eventually death. Johne’s disease is prevalent in the UK, including Scotland. Direct costs and losses associated with Johne’s disease have been estimated in previous research, confirming an important economic impact of the disease in UK herds. Despite this, the distributional impact of Johne’s disease among milk consumers and producers in Scotland has not been estimated. In this paper, we evaluate the change in society’s economic welfare, namely to dairy producers (i.e. infected and uninfected herds) and milk consumers in Scotland induced by the introduction of Johne’s disease in the national Scottish dairy herd. At the national-level, we conclude that the economic burden falls mainly on producers of infected herds and, to a lesser extent, milk consumers, while producers of uninfected herds benefit from the presence of Johne’s. An infected producer’s loss per cow is approximately two times larger in magnitude than that of an uninfected producer’s gain. Such economic welfare estimates are an important comparison of the relative costs of national herd prevalence and the wider economic welfare implications for both producers and consumers. This is particularly important from a policy, public good, cost sharing, and human health perspective. The economic welfare framework presented in this paper can be applied to other diseases to examine the relative burden of society’s economic welfare of alternative livestock disease scenarios. In addition, the sensitivity analysis evaluates uncertainty in economic welfare given limited data and uncertainty in the national herd prevalence, and other input parameters, associated with Johne’s disease in Scotland. Therefore, until the prevalence of Johne’s is better understood, the full economic cost to Scottish dairy herds remains uncertain but in the meantime the sensitivity analysis evaluates the robustness of economic welfare to such uncertainties.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>7f55c49b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198436</link><crawled>1528384685390</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163dad3854e:658f435:3dd877af</id><author><name>Alyson S.

White adipose tissue expands through both adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia and it is hypothesized that fibrosis or excess accumulation of extracellular matrix within adipose tissue may limit tissue expansion contributing to metabolic dysfunction. The pathways that control adipose tissue remodeling are only partially understood, however it is likely that adipose tissue stromal and perivascular progenitors participate in fibrotic remodeling and also serve as adipocyte progenitors. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of the secreted extracellular matrix protein aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP) on adipose progenitor differentiation in the context of adipose tissue fibrosis. Treatment of 10T1/2 mouse cells with recombinant ACLP suppressed adipogenesis and enhanced myofibroblast differentiation, which was dependent on transforming growth factor-β receptor kinase activity. Mice fed a chronic high fat diet exhibited white adipose tissue fibrosis with elevated ACLP expression and cellular fractionation of these depots revealed that ACLP was co-expressed with collagens primarily in the inflammatory cell depleted stromal-vascular fraction (SVF). SVF cells isolated from mice fed a high fat diet secreted increased amounts of ACLP compared to low fat diet control SVF. These cells also exhibited reduced adipogenic differentiation capacity in vitro. Importantly, differentiation studies in primary human adipose stromal cells revealed that mature adipocytes do not express ACLP and exogenous ACLP administration blunted their differentiation potential while upregulating myofibroblastic markers. Collectively, these studies identify ACLP as a stromal derived mediator of adipose progenitor differentiation that may limit adipocyte expansion during white adipose tissue fibrosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>57a7e866</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197777</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd74:3dd877af</id><author><name>Mike Jager</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mike Jager, Mi-Jeong Lee, Chendi Li, Stephen R.

In the Speech-to-Song Illusion, repetition of a spoken phrase results in it being perceived as if it were sung. Although a number of previous studies have examined which characteristics of the stimulus will produce the illusion, there is, until now, no description of the cognitive mechanism that underlies the illusion. We suggest that the processes found in Node Structure Theory that are used to explain normal language processing as well as other auditory illusions might also account for the Speech-to-Song Illusion. In six experiments we tested whether the satiation of lexical nodes, but continued priming of syllable nodes may lead to the Speech-to-Song Illusion. The results of these experiments provide evidence for the role of priming, activation, and satiation as described in Node Structure Theory as an explanation of the Speech-to-Song Illusion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>cc265f9b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198656</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0b9:2835af05</id><author><name>Nichol Castro</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nichol Castro, Joshua M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Availability of correct and adequate information about medicines is an important aspect in ensuring rational use of medicines and hence facilitating safety and expected efficacy of medicines during therapy. Package inserts have proven to be a good source of information to the prescribers and patients whereby they have been useful in highlighting important information pertaining proper use and handling of the medicines. The present study was aimed at establishing the extent to which package inserts of medicines circulating on the markets of the East African Community (EAC) Partner States conform to medicines information requirements as established in the harmonized guidelines as well as national guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 99 package inserts from six (6) types of medicines namely Albendazole, Artemether/Lumefantrine (ALu), Ciprofloxacin, Paracetamol, Amoxicillin and Metronidazole were purposefully collected from three EAC Partner States: Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The medicines were selected based on their indications as first line treatments, high rates of utilization within the medicines supply system and their positions in treatment of diseases of public importance across EAC Partner States. The inserts were evaluated on the availability of information regarding fifteen (15) parameters as extracted from the EAC harmonized guidelines for registration of medicines. Moreover, comparisons were made between the percentage conformity of the branded versus generic products, markets from which the samples were collected, origin of the manufacturer and type of medicine.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Majority (93.9–100%) of the medicines’ package inserts highly conformed to the inclusion of the information regarding the description and composition of the medications, indications, dosage and methods of administration, warnings and precautions, contraindications and storage conditions. However, the information on handling and disposal, container package description, excipients used, clinical pharmacology of the medicines, and directions regarding overdose ranked the least in conformance with conformity ranging from 13.1–52.5%.The parameter with the lowest observed percentage conformity among the branded products scored 50% as compared to 10.8% among the generic products. Moreover, there was no significant difference (P&amp;lt;0.05) in the percentage conformity of the package inserts collected from each of the three Partner States as compared to the average from studied medicines. A generally good conformity was observed among medicines manufactured by European based manufacturers as compared to those based in Asia and EAC Partner States. In addition, PIs of Albendazole, Ciprofloxacin, Amoxicillin and Artemether/Lumefantrine did show overall high conformity across most of the product information requirements.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study revealed the existence of a significant number of medicinal products circulating on the markets of EAC Partner States without necessary compliance with all product information requirements. We therefore recommend that NMRAs ensure thorough pre-market assessment of product information as well as strengthening their post marketing surveillance to ensure that medicines circulating on the market comply to medicines information requirements at all times. Emphasis should also be given to manufacturers on the importance of inclusion of appropriate and adequate product information for the safety of patients, including advocating for inclusion of patient-friendly and easy to understand medicines information.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>375e3cff</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197490</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709405a:2835af05</id><author><name>Hiiti B.

Describing and understanding close proximity interactions between infant and family members can provide key information on transmission opportunities of respiratory infections within households. Among respiratory infections, pertussis represents a public health priority. Pertussis infection can be particularly harmful to young, unvaccinated infants and for these patients, family members represent the main sources of transmission. Here, we report on the use of wearable proximity sensors based on RFID technology to measure face-to-face proximity between family members within 16 households with infants younger than 6 months for 2–5 consecutive days of data collection. The sensors were deployed over the course of approximately 1 year, in the context of a national research project aimed at the improvement of infant pertussis prevention strategies. We investigated differences in close-range interactions between family members and we assessed whether demographic variables or feeding practices affect contact patterns between parents and infants. A total of 5,958 contact events were recorded between 55 individuals: 16 infants, 4 siblings, 31 parents and 4 grandparents. The aggregated contact networks, obtained for each household, showed a heterogeneous distribution of the cumulative time spent in proximity with the infant by family members. Contact matrices defined by age and by family role showed that most of the contacts occurred between the infant and other family members (70%), while 30% of contacts was among family members (infants excluded). Many contacts were observed between infants and adults, in particular between infant and mother, followed by father, siblings and grandparents. A larger number of contacts and longer contact durations between infant and other family members were observed in families adopting exclusive breastfeeding, compared to families in which the infant receives artificial or mixed feeding. Our results demonstrate how a high-resolution measurement of contact matrices within infants’ households is feasible using wearable proximity sensing devices. Moreover, our findings suggest the mother is responsible for the large majority of the infant’s contact pattern, thus being the main potential source of infection for a transmissible disease. As the contribution to the infants’ contact pattern by other family members is very variable, vaccination against pertussis during pregnancy is probably the best strategy to protect young, unvaccinated infants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>92622ee7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198733</link><crawled>1528394402297</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db67c9f9:679b314:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Laura Ozella</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Ozella, Francesco Gesualdo, Michele Tizzoni, Caterina Rizzo, Elisabetta Pandolfi, Ilaria Campagna, Alberto Eugenio Tozzi, Ciro Cattuto&lt;/p&gt;

Many implementations of pooled screens in mammalian cells rely on linking an element of interest to a barcode, with the latter subsequently quantitated by next generation sequencing. However, substantial uncoupling between these paired elements during lentiviral production has been reported, especially as the distance between elements increases. We detail that PCR amplification is another major source of uncoupling, and becomes more pronounced with increased amounts of DNA template molecules and PCR cycles. To lessen uncoupling in systems that use paired elements for detection, we recommend minimizing the distance between elements, using low and equal template DNA inputs for plasmid and genomic DNA during PCR, and minimizing the number of PCR cycles. We also present a vector design for conducting combinatorial CRISPR screens that enables accurate barcode-based detection with a single short sequencing read and minimal uncoupling.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>6dd023e8</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197547</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd6f:3dd877af</id><author><name>Mudra Hegde</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mudra Hegde, Christine Strand, Ruth E.

In mammals, the liver and kidney play central roles in protecting the organism from xenobiotics, and are at high risk of xenobiotic-induced injury. Liver and kidney damage by drugs and industrial toxins have been extensively studied from both classical histopathologic and biochemical perspectives. Methods and Findings: We introduce a machine learning approach for the analysis of toxicological response. Unsupervised characterization of physiological and histological changes in a large toxicogenomic dataset revealed nine discrete toxin-induced disease states. Transcriptome analysis showed that some of the machine-identified disease states correspond to known pathology, and to known effects of certain toxin classes, but others were novel. Analysis of dynamics revealed transitions between disease states at constant toxin exposure, mostly in the direction of decreased pathology, which implies induction of tolerance. Tolerance correlated with induction of known xenobiotic defense genes and novel decreased ferroptosis sensitivity biomarkers.

Combined analysis of food consumption, body weight, and molecular biomarkers indicated that organ disease states promote cachexia by whole-body signaling through Gdf15 and Igf1, suggesting strategies for therapeutic intervention that may be broadly relevant to human disease.

In mammals, the liver and kidney play central roles in protecting the organism from xenobiotics, and are at high risk of xenobiotic-induced injury. Liver and kidney damage by drugs and industrial toxins have been extensively studied from both classical histopathologic and biochemical perspectives. Methods and Findings: We introduce a machine learning approach for the analysis of toxicological response. Unsupervised characterization of physiological and histological changes in a large toxicogenomic dataset revealed nine discrete toxin-induced disease states. Transcriptome analysis showed that some of the machine-identified disease states correspond to known pathology, and to known effects of certain toxin classes, but others were novel. Analysis of dynamics revealed transitions between disease states at constant toxin exposure, mostly in the direction of decreased pathology, which implies induction of tolerance. Tolerance correlated with induction of known xenobiotic defense genes and novel decreased ferroptosis sensitivity biomarkers. These data reinforce emerging evidence that ferroptosis drives organ pathology, and suggest that its downreagulation may promote tolerance and recovery. Lastly, mechanism of body weight decrease, a known primary marker for toxicity, was investigated. Combined analysis of food consumption, body weight, and molecular biomarkers indicated that organ disease states promote cachexia by whole-body signaling through Gdf15 and Igf1, suggesting strategies for therapeutic intervention that may be broadly relevant to human disease. Conclusions: Application of machine learning to systematic data collection of physiology, histopathology, transcriptome reveals multiple disease states, tolerance mechanisms and organ to whole-body communication.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/q4R79eoNECM/s41598-018-26729-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>The influence of salinity on the effects of Multi-walled carbon nanotubes on polychaetes</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26729-2/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26729_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>562</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26729-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26729-2</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The influence of salinity on the effects of Multi-walled carbon nanotubes on polychaetes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influence of salinity on the effects of Multi-walled carbon nanotubes on polychaetes, Published online: 05 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26729-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26729-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The influence of salinity on the effects of Multi-walled carbon nanotubes on polychaetes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/q4R79eoNECM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528182000000</published><fingerprint>f2d85bdc</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26729-2</link><crawled>1528190424824</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163cf3f56f8:5289e34:3dd877af</id><author><name>Lucia De Marchi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The influence of salinity on the effects of Multi-walled carbon nanotubes on polychaetes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influence of salinity on the effects of Multi-walled carbon nanotubes on polychaetes, Published online: 05 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26729-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26729-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The influence of salinity on the effects of Multi-walled carbon nanotubes on polychaetes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/q4R79eoNECM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/BltGco6BoQE/acs.jmedchem.8b00114</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Discovery and Optimization of Indolyl-Containing 4-Hydroxy-2-Pyridone Type II DNA Topoisomerase Inhibitors Active against Multidrug Resistant Gram-negative Bacteria</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00114</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00114</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00114/20180514/images/medium/jm-2018-00114d_0016.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00114&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Treatment failures in advanced lung cancer are frequent events affecting patients during or after first-line chemotherapy. International guidelines recommend second-line chemotherapy. However, around one half of patients who experience disease progression enter a systemic second-line therapy. In the herein qualitative study, we investigated patients&apos; thoughts and attitudes determining the decision to undergo a second-line chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Thirty-three purposively selected patients who recently accepted second-line or palliative chemotherapy were invited to participate in this survey consisting of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Grounded theory was applied to investigate participants’ perceptions of the context that have surrounded their decision to undergo palliative chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For most patients, tumor burden and reduced quality of life in relation with lung cancer itself were major drivers of the decision-making process. There was a balance between two different attitudes: making a decision to undergo a new line of chemotherapy or starting a psychological process in order to accept end of life. Choosing between these two attitudes allowed the patient to keep the matter of palliative care at a distance. Even in case of low chance of success, many patients who worried about their life partner&apos;s future would accept a new chemotherapy line. Some patients experienced ambivalent thoughts regarding social network, particularly about their family as daily function impairment required an increased need for relative&apos;s support. The initial &amp;quot;Worrying about others&amp;quot; thoughts left place to in an increasing self-need of care as those provided by relatives; this phenomenon might increase patients&apos; self- perception of being a burden for others. Confidence previously established with formal caregiver support was another major decision driver: some patients with sustained confidence in their medical staff may have privileged this formal support rather than family support when the latter was perceived as weak, insufficient or intrusive.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study identified three domains involved into a complex interplay for lung cancer patients’ decision regarding second-line palliative chemotherapy: (i) perception of the definitive loss of health, (ii) interactions between idiosyncrasy (hope, disease burden) and environment (healthcare and social network support), and (iii) patient&apos;s subjective evaluation of chemotherapy benefit–risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>8ee70238</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197605</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd70:3dd877af</id><author><name>Jean-Louis Pujol</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jean-Louis Pujol, Benoît Roch, Caroline Roth, Jean-Pierre Mérel&lt;/p&gt;

The potential use of bone progenitors, multipotential stromal cells (MSCs) helping spine fusion is increasing, but convenient MSC sources and effective processing methods are critical factors yet to be optimised. The aim of this study was to test the effect of bone marrow processing on the MSC abundance and to compare the differentiation capabilities of vertebral body-bone marrow (VB-BM) MSCs versus iliac crest-bone marrow (IC-BM) MSCs. We assessed the effect of the red blood cell lysis (ammonium chloride, AC) and density-gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep™, LMP), on the extracted VB-BM and IC-BM MSC numbers. The MSC abundance (indicated by colony counts and CD45&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD271&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cell numbers), phenotype, proliferation and tri-lineage differentiation of VB-BM MSCs were compared with donor-matched IC-BM MSCs. Importantly, the MSC attachment and osteogenesis were examined when VB-BM and IC-BM samples were loaded on a beta-tricalcium phosphate scaffold. In contrast to LMP, using AC yielded more colonies from IC-BM and VB-BM aspirates (p = 0.0019 &amp;amp; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0201 respectively). For IC-BM and VB-BM, the colony counts and CD45&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD271&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cell numbers were comparable (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.5186, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.2640 respectively). Furthermore, cultured VB-BM MSCs exhibited the same phenotype, proliferative and adipogenic potential, but a higher osteogenic and chondrogenic capabilities than IC-BM MSCs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0010 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0005 for calcium and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels, respectively). The gene expression data confirmed higher chondrogenesis for VB-BM MSCs than IC-BM MSCs, but osteogenic gene expression levels were comparable. When loaded on Vitoss™, both MSCs showed a similar degree of attachment and survival, but a better osteogenic ability was detected for VB-BM MSCs as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0386). Collectively, the BM processing using AC had more MSC yield than using LMP. VB-BM MSCs have a comparable phenotype and proliferative capacity, but higher chondrogenesis and osteogenesis with or without using scaffold than donor-matched IC-BM MSCs. Given better accessibility, VB-BM could be an ideal MSC source for spinal bone fusion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>18d49064</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197969</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e2e:2835af05</id><author><name>Evangelos M.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To distinguish clinical factors that have time-varying (as opposed to constant) impact upon patient and graft survival among pediatric liver transplant recipients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using national data from 2002 through 2013, we examined potential clinical and demographic covariates using Gray’s piecewise constant time-varying coefficients (TVC) models. For both patient and graft survival, we estimated univariable and multivariable Gray’s TVC, retaining significant covariates based on backward selection. We then estimated the same specification using traditional Cox proportional hazards (PH) models and compared our findings.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For patient survival, covariates included recipient diagnosis, age, race/ethnicity, ventilator support, encephalopathy, creatinine levels, use of living donor, and donor age. Only the effects of recipient diagnosis and donor age were constant; effects of other covariates varied over time. We retained identical covariates in the graft survival model but found several differences in their impact.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The flexibility afforded by Gray’s TVC estimation methods identify several covariates that do not satisfy constant proportionality assumptions of the Cox PH model.

Incorporating better survival estimates is critical for improving risk prediction tools used by the transplant community to inform organ allocation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5028377?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Mechanical properties of drug loaded diblock copolymer bilayers: A molecular dynamics study</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 21, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5028377?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/21&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 21&lt;/a&gt;, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528179161000</published><fingerprint>55f8f501</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5028377?af=R</link><crawled>1528356065737</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163d91ed1c9:63c5121:2835af05</id><author><name>Damián A.

In mountainous landscapes, soil moisture is highly dynamic due to the effects of topography and the temporal variability imposed by seasonal precipitation, including rainfall and snow.

In this study we used an extensive suite of measurements to examine the effects of seasonal changes in soil moisture on the isotopic composition of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production at the landscape level.

This seemingly generalizable pattern for a snow-dominated watershed is likely to represent the variability of recently assimilated C, tracked through the plant-soil system and imprinted in the respired CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Slaughterhouse surveillance through post-mortem meat inspection provides an important mechanism for detecting bovine tuberculosis (bTB) infections in cattle herds in Great Britain (GB), complementary to the live animal skin test based programme. We explore patterns in the numbers of herd breakdowns detected through slaughterhouse surveillance and develop a Bayesian hierarchical regression model to assess the associations of animal-level factors with the odds of an infected animal being detected in the slaughterhouse, allowing us to highlight slaughterhouses that show atypical patterns of detection. The analyses demonstrate that the numbers and proportions of breakdowns detected in slaughterhouses increased in GB over the period of study (1998–2013). The odds of an animal being a slaughterhouse case was strongly associated with the region of the country that the animal spent most of its life, with animals living in high-frequency testing areas of England having on average 21 times the odds of detection compared to animals living in Scotland. There was also a strong effect of age, with animals slaughtered at &gt; 60 months of age having 5.3 times the odds of detection compared to animals slaughtered between 0–18 months of age. Smaller effects were observed for cattle having spent time on farms with a history of bTB, quarter of the year that the animal was slaughtered, movement and test history. Over-and-above these risks, the odds of detection increased by a factor of 1.1 for each year of the study. After adjustment for these variables, there were additional variations in risk between slaughterhouses and breed. Our framework has been adopted into the routine annual surveillance reporting carried out by the Animal Plant Health Agency and may be used to target more detailed investigation of meat inspection practices.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>b9949ab5</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198760</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0bd:2835af05</id><author><name>Trevelyan J.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In addition to conventional therapies, several new strategies have been proposed for modulating autoimmune diseases, including the adoptive transfer of immunological cells. In this context, dendritic cells (DCs) appear to be one of the most promising treatments for autoimmune disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of adoptive transfer of DCs obtained from both naïve and ovalbumin (OVA)-tolerant mice on the severity of TNBS induced colitis and analyze the eventual protective mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;To induce oral tolerance, BALB/c mice were fed 4mg/mL OVA solution for seven consecutive days. Spleen DCs were isolated from tolerant (tDC) and naïve (nDC) mice, and then adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice. Three days later, colitis was induced in DC treated mice by intrarectal instillation of 100μg2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 50% ethanol. Control subjects received only intrarectal instillation of either TNBS solution or a vehicle. Five days later, mice from all groups were euthanized and examined for physiological and immunological parameters. Regarding the phenotype, we observed that the frequencies of CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHC II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were significantly lower in DCs isolated from tolerant mice than in those from naive mice. However, pretreatment with both types of DCs was able to significantly reduce clinical signs of colitis such as diarrhea, rectal prolapse, bleeding, and cachexia, although only treatment with tDCs was able to prevent weight loss from instillation of TNBS. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; proliferation of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs was significantly lower than that observed in splenic cell cultures of naïve mice. Although no significant difference was observed in the frequencies of Treg cells in the experimental groups, the frequency of Th17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;cellsand the secretion of IL-17 were more reduced in the cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs. The levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ were lower in supernatants of cells from mice treated with nDCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results allow us to conclude that the adoptive transfer of cells expressing CD11c is able to reduce the clinical and immunological signs of drug-induced colitis. Adoptive transfer of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DC isolated from both naive and tolerant mice altered the proliferative and T cell responses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously published data showing the protective effects of DCs from naïve or tolerant mice in the treatment of colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>15856e54</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196994</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475060:2835af05</id><author><name>Lisiery N.

The identification of germplasm resources is an important aspect of sugarcane breeding. The aim of this study was to introduce a new method for identifying &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and its progeny. First, we cloned and sequenced nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (nrDNA-ITS) sequences from 20 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms. Analysis of these nrDNA-ITS sequences showed a stable mutation at base 89. Primers (FO13, RO13, FI16, and RI16) were then designed for tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR based on mutations at base 89 of the nrDNA-ITS sequence. An additional 71 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms were identified using this tetra-primer ARMS PCR method, which confirmed that the method using the described primers successfully identified &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and progeny. These results may help improve the efficiency of modern molecular breeding of sugarcane and lay a foundation for identification of sugarcane germplasms and the relationships among them.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>ce7e2562</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197458</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b9:2835af05</id><author><name>Shan Yang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shan Yang, Xueting Li, Fei Huang, Yongji Huang, Xinlong Liu, Jiayun Wu, Qinnan Wang, Zuhu Deng, Rukai Chen, Muqing Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Zinc is an essential mineral, but our understanding of its uses in the body is limited. Capitalizing on approaches available in the model system &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, Zhao and colleagues show that zinc transduces a signal that induces sperm to become motile. This is an enigmatic process because sperm in all sexually-reproducing animals are transcriptionally inactive. Zinc levels inside sperm are regulated by an evolutionarily conserved zinc transporter called Zrt- and Irt-like Protein Transporter 7.1 (ZIPT-7.1). This zinc transporter localizes to intracellular organelles, suggesting that it primarily controls zinc levels by releasing zinc into the cytoplasm from internal stores rather than importing it from the external environment. The zinc released within cells acts as a messenger in a signaling pathway to promote mobility acquisition. These studies reveal an important role for zinc as an intracellular second messenger that generates physiological changes vital for sperm motility and fertility.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/XYCrK2qbn9w&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>3493b394</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006204</link><crawled>1528393384581</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163db584285:4559ea:a96d255</id><author><name>Diana S.

Repositioning of the maxilla in orthognathic surgery is carried out for functional and aesthetic purposes. Pre-surgical planning tools can predict 3D facial appearance by computing the response of the soft tissue to the changes to the underlying skeleton. The clinical use of commercial prediction software remains controversial, likely due to the deterministic nature of these computational predictions. A novel probabilistic finite element model (FEM) for the prediction of postoperative facial soft tissues is proposed in this paper. A probabilistic FEM was developed and validated on a cohort of eight patients who underwent maxillary repositioning and had pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken. Firstly, a variables correlation assessed various modelling parameters. Secondly, a design of experiments (DOE) provided a range of potential outcomes based on uniformly distributed input parameters, followed by an optimisation. Lastly, the second DOE iteration provided optimised predictions with a probability range. A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>bf09ec4d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee8:2835af05</id><author><name>Paul G.

Med. Chem. on “&lt;em&gt;What Makes a Great Medicinal Chemist&lt;/em&gt;“. As he makes clear from the beginning, if you’ve been doing this stuff for a while, you’ve likely heard many of these recommendations before. But it’s useful for people starting out, and it’s also useful for organization to think about what they’re encouraging (and what they’re not!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several characteristics common to good scientists in general – paraphrasing, we have: (1) intellectual curiosity, (2) ability to focus on the problem at hand, (3) pragmatic approach to problem-solving, (4) respect for data, (5) attention to detail, (6) sense of urgency, (7) awareness of other work in the field, (8) openness to new technologies (once they’ve proved their utility!), (9) willingness to challenge assumptions and ditch old ones, (10) enjoyment of their work, (11) awareness of the limits of their knowledge, (12) resiliency, (13) effective at communication, (14) working well with team members (there are exceptions!), (15) not constantly seeking credit, and (16) looking for mentors early on, and serving as one later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past that, he has traits that are more specific to medicinal chemists: (17) never losing sight of the final drug profile, (18) the ability to come up with unusual structural ideas when needed, (19) attention to more than just potency, (20) three-dimensional thinking, (21) awareness of the need for different chemical series/scaffolds, (22) awareness of the competition, but not being scared of IP space, (23) never giving on validated targets, since they’re rare, (24) a deep understanding of biology, (25) decisiveness about what the next steps in a project should be, (26) being unafraid of tough chemistry (in a good cause), (27) a willingness to repurpose anything (in a good cause), and (28) awareness of the history of the field and its current state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s quite a list! And it should be clear at the outset that you’re not going to find people – or not too many – who have all those qualities turned up to 11. But they’re all useful and important, and it’s worth looking over them to see what your strengths are (and especially what you might need to shore up a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few comments on specific items: I think that (3), (9), and (27) are aspects of the same approach to applied research – that is, a willingness to go with what works, even if it isn’t your idea, even if it disproves your favorite assumptions, even if it seems weird or even if it seems obvious or old. Things that work, that really work, are the ace cards in the deck. Solid experimental evidence brushes aside feelings, theories, and assumptions (quality 4 above ), and you have to be ready to come to terms with it and figure out where it’s telling you to go next (quality 25). A corollary is that if you’re running experiments whose results are not going to be solid or important enough for you to base such decisions on, then why? We’ve all sat in meetings where someone outlines an experiment that (if it works) means the project goes on as planned. But if it doesn’t work? Then. . .the project goes on as planned anyway. It’s hard to see how that’s not, at some level, a waste of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also has a connection with (11), knowing what you don’t know. There are mistakes at both ends of the scale (there always are), and in this case it’s being too tentative or being too confident. Chemists, in my experience, are more prone to the latter, the mistake the Greeks called &lt;em&gt;hubris&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone who’s honest with themselves about biomedical research has to admit that most of the time, about most things, we can only aspire to the level of actually knowing jack diddley. What really causes Alzheimer’s? What are the specific neuronal processes involved in consciousness? What’s the specific molecular process you’d need to hit to stop multiple sclerosis or lupus? On a more immediate level, why does Compound Series A get into cells while Compound Series B doesn’t? What do I need to do to the lead compound to make it about two times more potent at the target? Or about ten times less potent at that other target it’s hitting? What other targets is the thing hitting, anyway? And so on. Decision-making under these conditions is. . .nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why many of the desirable qualities above can in fact work against each other, if taken to extremes or misapplied. Attention to detail is important – but not to the point where you become unable to make a call because you can think of bad consequences every way you turn. Ability to focus is important, but not if it leads to glossing over key experimental data that are trying to tell you something. Mistakes at both ends of the scale!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(24), understanding of biology, deserves some comment. My feeling is that not many people from other fields tend to know much about organic or medicinal chemistry, nor do they seem particularly eager to learn. So we chemists have a real advantage, knowing this stuff already, but you can’t rest on that advantage, either. The point is to start from there and &lt;em&gt;go learn about the other stuff&lt;/em&gt;. You can be useful as a chemist (at an entry-level position) without knowing much about the biology involved – just bang out compounds. But you cannot be really good at the job with that approach, nor (as time goes on) will you continue to be as valuable to your employer – or any other employer. The chemistry is just a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quality worth noting is (12), resilience. A constant feature of drug research is that most things, most of the time, don’t work that well. Your ideas about improving the compounds? By golly, here come the assay data, and it’s back to the bench we go. You have to be ready for your best ideas, your biggest bolts of inspiration, to land in a tangled heap over and over. It takes getting used to, and some personality types are just not suited to it. Longterm med-chemists exhibit survivorship bias; they’re the ones who have been able to deal, but not everyone can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been focusing on individual behavior, but as mentioned above, there’s something to be said about organizations, too. Managers of all types should think about whether their labs, departments, or companies are providing a good home for these behaviors or not. Be honest. I’m not talking about wall posters, e-mail newsletters, or “State of the Company” speeches. Your mission statement might say that you’re committed to innovation or something, but talk is as cheap as it’s ever been. For employees looking at their own management, my advice is always this: don’t pay so much attention to what they say, but rather &lt;em&gt;watch what they do&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t read the slogans on the intranet pages – pay attention and &lt;em&gt;watch what behaviors your company actually rewards&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they’re valuing the sorts of things on Murcko’s list, that’s good news. But if they’re not, they may be rewarding some less worthwhile behaviors, like delivering on deadline even if it means delivering crap, whacking people on the head for coming up with inconvenient data or ideas, advancing projects based more on who proposed them than intrinsic merit, etc. There’s a whole Devil’s Dictionary/Screwtape Letters list of things that good medicinal chemists and scientists &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; do, and you need to be alert to their presence, too.

Background &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) had been reported to be rare. However, recent studies using echocardiography as a screening method showed conflicting results, and the true prevalence is still unclear. Since diagnosing primary SS is difficult because of its heterogeneous nature, a number of patients with primary-SS-associated PAH may be misdiagnosed with idiopathic PAH, losing their chance to undergo immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prevalence of primary SS among patients who initially present with PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From our prospective institutional PAH database, 40 consecutive patients without any obvious cause of PAH at the time of PAH diagnosis were identified. We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of primary SS diagnosed during or after the initial assessment of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the initial assessment, one patient was diagnosed with primary-SS-associated PAH. Among the 25 patients who were initially diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, five were diagnosed with primary SS during their course of the disease. Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation. The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH. Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH. Clinicians should pay specific attention and carefully evaluate the possibility of primary SS in patients with PAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>fc27df4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197297</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b7f:93d646dc</id><author><name>Tatsuyuki Sato</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuyuki Sato, Masaru Hatano, Yukiko Iwasaki, Hisataka Maki, Akihito Saito, Shun Minatsuki, Toshiro Inaba, Eisuke Amiya, Keishi Fujio, Masafumi Watanabe, Kazuhiko Yamamoto, Issei Komuro&lt;/p&gt;

Furthermore, there is no method to identify the sequences of unknown HLA types not registered in HLA databases. We developed a Bayesian model, called ALPHLARD, that collects reads potentially generated from HLA genes and accurately determines a pair of HLA types for each of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1 genes at 6-digit resolution. Furthermore, ALPHLARD can detect rare germline variants not stored in HLA databases and call somatic mutations from paired normal and tumor sequence data. We illustrate the capability of ALPHLARD using 253 WES data and 25 WGS data from Illumina platforms. By comparing the results of HLA genotyping from SBT and amplicon sequencing methods, ALPHLARD achieved 98.8% for WES data and 98.5% for WGS data at 4-digit resolution. We also detected three somatic point mutations and one case of loss of heterozygosity in the HLA genes from the WGS data. ALPHLARD showed good performance for HLA genotyping even from low-coverage data. It also has a potential to detect rare germline variants and somatic mutations in HLA genes. It would help to fill in the current gaps in HLA reference databases and unveil the immunological significance of somatic mutations identified in HLA genes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1526454000000</published><fingerprint>2639a001</fingerprint><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323766v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1526502999081</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636aab4429:42f3bf6:3dd877af</id><author><name>Hayashi, S.</name></author><description>Although human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping based on amplicon, whole exome sequence (WES), and RNA sequence data has been achieved in recent years, accurate genotyping from whole genome sequence (WGS) data remains a challenge due to the low depth.

ALPHLARD showed good performance for HLA genotyping even from low-coverage data. It also has a potential to detect rare germline variants and somatic mutations in HLA genes. It would help to fill in the current gaps in HLA reference databases and unveil the immunological significance of somatic mutations identified in HLA genes.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197929</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>The characteristics of pediatric emergency department visits in Korea: An observational study analyzing Korea Health Panel data</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197929</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197929</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dong Hyun Seo, Min Joung Kim, Kyung Hwan Kim, Junseok Park, Dong Wun Shin, Hoon Kim, Woochan Jeon, Hyunjong Kim, Joon Min Park&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;We investigated the characteristics of pediatric emergency department (ED) patients in Korea and determined factors associated with hospital admission after ED treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Korea Health Panel data from 2008 through 2013 were analyzed retrospectively; we included patients under 18 years old who visited the ED at least once. We collected patient and household epidemiologic data such as sex, age group, region of residence, disability, chronic disease, household income quintile, national health insurance type, use of private insurance, and annual frequency of ED visits. We also examined data related to each ED visit, such as reason for visit, medical service provided, and hospital size/ownership. We then investigated which factors were correlated with case disposition (discharge home or hospital admission) after ED treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 3,160 pediatric ED visits occurred during the six-year period. Males (57.5%) and children aged 0–5 years (47.7%) made more visits than females and older children, respectively. The proportion of ED visits for disease (67.7%) was much higher than for injury or poisoning (32.2%), and 452 cases (14.3%) required hospital admission. For hospital admission, the odds ratio (OR) of females was 0.73 compared to males, and the OR of children aged 6–11 was 0.68 compared to children aged 0–5. The OR of capital residents was 0.69 compared to province residents, and the OR of the highest income quintile was 0.51 compared to the lowest quintile. The OR of children with private insurance coverage was 0.49 compared to those lacking private insurance, and the OR of ED visits due to disease was 1.82 compared to visits due to injury/poisoning.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This analysis of clinical and demographic characteristics of pediatric ED visits and hospital admissions can serve as the foundation of future prospective studies required for establishing appropriate policies for the Korean pediatric emergency medical system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>a96ee459</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197929</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e26:2835af05</id><author><name>Dong Hyun Seo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dong Hyun Seo, Min Joung Kim, Kyung Hwan Kim, Junseok Park, Dong Wun Shin, Hoon Kim, Woochan Jeon, Hyunjong Kim, Joon Min Park&lt;/p&gt;

4′-cyano-2′-deoxyinosine (SK14-061a), a novel nucleoside analog based on inosine, has antiviral activity against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 that has the ability to acquire resistance against many types of reverse transcriptase inhibitors based on nucleosides. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics studies after its oral administration to rats. For this purpose, we first developed and validated an analytical method for quantitatively determining SK14-061a levels in biological samples by a UPLC system interfaced with a TOF-MS system. A rapid, simple and selective method for the quantification of SK14-061a in biological samples was established using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with solid phase extraction. The pharmacokinetic properties of SK14-061a in rats after oral administration were then evaluated using this LC-MS method. SK14-061a was found to be relatively highly bioavailable, is rapidly absorbed from the intestinal tract, and is then mainly distributed to the liver and then ultimately excreted via the urine in an unchanged form. Furthermore, the simultaneous administration of SK14-061a with the nucleoside analog, entecavir, led to a significant alteration in the pharmacokinetics of SK14-061a. These results suggest that the SK14-061a has favorable pharmacokinetic properties with a high bioavailability with the potential for use in oral pharmaceutical formulations, but drug-drug interactions should also be considered.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>50058574</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198636</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f56:2835af05</id><author><name>Mai Hashimoto</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Hashimoto, Kazuaki Taguchi, Takako Ishiguro, Satoru Kohgo, Shuhei Imoto, Keishi Yamasaki, Hiroaki Mitsuya, Masaki Otagiri&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most common urologic malignancies and it is urgently needed to identify novel potential prognostic biomarkers for predicting prognosis and progression of patients with BC in clinical practice. Previous research has revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) played critical roles in BC, and may serve as novel potential prognostic biomarkers in patients with BC. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the prognostic potential of lncRNAs in BC patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). According to the predefined exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 9 recently published articles comprising 13 lncRNAs and 666 BC patients were included into this meta-analysis. We analyzed the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine the relationship between lncRNAs expression and survival outcomes. We also analyzed the odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the association between lncRNAs expression and clinicopathological characteristics, including histological grade, gender, multifocality, tumor size, and tumor stage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our results revealed that high lncRNAs expression was associated with shorter overall survival in Asian BC patients (pooled HR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.35–4.00, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, random-effect). High lncRNAs expression levels were significantly associated with histological grade (G2-G3 vs. G1: OR = 3.857, 95%CI: 1.293–11.502, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015, random-effect).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In summary, this meta-analysis has demonstrated that lncRNAs could be used as potential prognostic markers for BC and high lncRNAs expression could predict poor prognosis among Asian BC patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>feae9dab</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198602</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd3:3dd877af</id><author><name>Yuexin Xia</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuexin Xia, Zhiyuan Liu, Weijian Yu, Shihang Zhou, Linnan Shao, Wenqian Song, Ming Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Global trade and the movement of people accelerate biological invasions by spreading species worldwide. Biosecurity measures seek to allow trade and passenger movements while preventing incursions that could lead to the establishment of unwanted pests, pathogens, and weeds. However, few data exist to evaluate whether changes in trade volumes, passenger arrivals, and biosecurity measures have altered rates of establishment of nonnative species over time. This is particularly true for pathogens, which pose significant risks to animal and plant health and are consequently a major focus of biosecurity efforts but are difficult to detect. Here, we use a database of all known plant pathogen associations recorded in New Zealand to estimate the rate at which new fungal pathogens arrived and established on 131 economically important plant species over the last 133 years. We show that the annual arrival rate of new fungal pathogens increased from 1880 to about 1980 in parallel with increasing import trade volume but subsequently stabilised despite continued rapid growth in import trade and recent rapid increases in international passenger arrivals. Nevertheless, while pathogen arrival rates for crop and pasture species have declined in recent decades, arrival rates have increased for forestry and fruit tree species. These contrasting trends between production sectors reflect differences in biosecurity effort and suggest that targeted biosecurity can slow pathogen arrival and establishment despite increasing trade and international movement of people.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wB5iS5OD44s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>26f2347c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006025</link><crawled>1527789422282</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163b75886ca:c89e4:ed160cc3</id><author><name>Benjamin A.

Here, we use a database of all known plant pathogen associations recorded in New Zealand to estimate the rate at which new fungal pathogens arrived and established on 131 economically important plant species over the last 133 years. We show that the annual arrival rate of new fungal pathogens increased from 1880 to about 1980 in parallel with increasing import trade volume but subsequently stabilised despite continued rapid growth in import trade and recent rapid increases in international passenger arrivals. Nevertheless, while pathogen arrival rates for crop and pasture species have declined in recent decades, arrival rates have increased for forestry and fruit tree species. These contrasting trends between production sectors reflect differences in biosecurity effort and suggest that targeted biosecurity can slow pathogen arrival and establishment despite increasing trade and international movement of people.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wB5iS5OD44s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4827.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Glassy dynamics of landscape evolution [Applied Physical Sciences]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4827</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/19/4827/F1.medium.gif</url><height>268</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4827.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Soil creeps imperceptibly downhill, but also fails catastrophically to create landslides.

Locomotor systems are widely used to study rhythmically active neural networks. These networks have to be coordinated in order to produce meaningful behavior. The crayfish swimmeret system is well suited to investigate such coordination of distributed neural oscillators because the neurons and their connectivity for generating and especially for coordinating the motor output are identified. The system maintains a fixed phase lag between the segmental oscillators, independent of cycle period. To further the understanding of the system’s plasticity for keeping the phase lag fixed, we profiled the neurotransmitters used by the Coordinating Neurons, which are necessary and sufficient for coordination of the segmental oscillators. We used a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and mass spectrometric methods. This arrangement of methods ensured that we could screen for several specific neurotransmitters, since a single method is often not suitable for all neurotransmitters of interest. In a first step, to preselect neurotransmitter candidates, we investigated the effect of substances known to be present in some swimmeret system neurons on the motor output and coordination. Subsequently, we demonstrated electrophysiologically that the identified synapse between the Coordinating Neurons and their target is mainly chemical, but neither glutamate antagonist nor γ-aminobutyric acid antagonist application affected this synapse. With immunohistochemical experiments, we provide strong evidence that the Coordinating Neurons are not serotonergic. Single-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with subsequent principal component analysis identified acetylcholine as the putative neurotransmitter for both types of Coordinating Neurons.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>3794c83f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197781</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406a:2835af05</id><author><name>Anna C.

In the last decades, the use of zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) in biomedical research has increased. Anaesthesia is daily used in fish during experimental procedures to avoid discomfort, stress or pain. Also, fish welfare and the reliability of results can be compromised if an unsuitable anaesthetic protocol is used. Therefore, we aimed to refine anaesthetic protocols to be used in adult zebrafish by evaluating the efficacy of different anaesthetics, used alone or in combination. For that, zebrafish were randomly assigned to 8 different groups: 100 μg/mLMS-222 (MS); 0.2 μg/mL etomidate (E); 0.2 μg/mL etomidate + 100 μg/mL lidocaine (E+L); 1.25 μg/mL propofol (P); 1.25 μg/mL propofol + 100 μg/mL lidocaine (P+L); 100 μg/mL ketamine (K); 100 μg/mL ketamine + 1.25 μg/mL medetomidine (K+M); and 100 μg/mL ketamine + 1.25 μg/mL medetomidine/3.125 μg/mL atipamezole (K+M/A). The animals were placed in an anaesthetic water bath, then, the following parameters were registered: time for equilibrium loss and anaesthesia induction, loss of sensitivity to soft and painful stimuli, respiratory rate, recovery time, and activity after recovery. The combined forms of E+L, P+L and K+M were the fastest to induce a surgical anaesthetic stage. Nevertheless, E+L induced respiratory depression, while K+M was shown to have the longer recovery time compared to MS-222, even when atipamezole was added. In conclusion, the P+L combination was shown to provide good anaesthesia with analgesia, without causing a major respiratory depression, providing as well a quick recovery, similar to MS-222.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>eb895b5a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197846</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094071:2835af05</id><author><name>Tânia Martins</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tânia Martins, Enoque Diniz, Luís M.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates genes in many physiological pathways by binding to enhancer and silencer elements of target genes, where it recruits coregulator proteins that remodel chromatin and regulate the assembly of transcription complexes. The coregulator Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is necessary for glucocorticoid (GC) regulation of one group of GR target genes, is irrelevant for a second group, and inhibits GR binding to a third gene set, thereby blocking their regulation by GC. Gene-specific characteristics that distinguish GR binding regions (GBR) at Hic-5 blocked genes from GBR at other GC-regulated genes are unknown. Here we show genome-wide that blocked GBR generally require CHD9 and BRM for GR occupancy in contrast to GBR that are not blocked by Hic-5. Hic-5 blocked GBR are enriched near Hic-5 blocked GR target genes but not near GR target genes that are not blocked by Hic-5. Furthermore blocked GBR are in a closed conformation prior to Hic-5 depletion, and require Hic-5 depletion and glucocorticoid treatment to create an open conformation necessary for GR occupancy. A transcription factor binding motif characteristic of the ETS family was enriched near blocked GBR and blocked genes but not near non-blocked GBR or non-blocked GR target genes. Thus, we identify specific differences in chromatin conformation, chromatin remodeler requirements, and local DNA sequence motifs that contribute to gene-specific actions of transcription factors and coregulators. These findings shed light on mechanisms that contribute to binding site selection by transcription factors, which vary in a cell type-specific manner.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>d9a86db1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196965</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47505b:2835af05</id><author><name>Brian H.

PCA allows similarities between individuals to be efficiently calculated and visualized, optimally in two dimensions.

B.</name></author><description>Principal components analysis (PCA) has been one of the most widely used exploration tools in genomic data analysis since its introduction in 1978 (Menozzi et al. 1978). PCA allows similarities between individuals to be efficiently calculated and visualized, optimally in two dimensions. While PCA is well suited to analyses concerned with autosomal DNA, no analogue for PCA exists for the analysis and visualization of non-autosomal DNA. In this paper we introduce a statistically valid method for the analysis of single-copy sequence data. We then show that tests for relationships between genetic information and qualitative and quantitative characteristics can be implemented in a rigorous statistical framework. We motivate the use of our method with examples from empirical data.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jctcce/~3/24BDe_yKpyM/acs.jctc.8b00173</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Kinetics of Huperzine A Dissociation from Acetylcholinesterase via Multiple Unbinding Pathways</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00173/20180523/images/medium/ct-2018-00173b_0008.gif</url><height>255</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00173</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00173</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00173/20180523/images/medium/ct-2018-00173b_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00173&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

These were present in 86%, 65%, and 40% of patients and had a median duration of 4, 4, and 5.5 days, respectively. The signs/symptoms were followed by myopia (appearance on day 5), insomnia (day 6), oliguria/anuria (day 6), polyuria (day 9), and sinus bradycardia (day 9.5). These were present in 35%, 30%, 28%, 91%, and 35% of patients; their median duration was 2, 2, 2, 7, and 1 day, respectively. Laboratory abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, elevated alanine aminotransferase, CRP, procalcitonin, creatinine, diminished glomerular filtration rate, and leukocytosis, were ascertained on admission to hospital or on the following day (day 5 or 6 of illness) and were established in 95%, 87%, 99%, 91%, 94%, 87%, and 55% of patients, and had a median duration of 4, 3, 7, 3, 9, 8, and 2 days, respectively.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Antenatal care (ANC) is a major public health intervention aimed at ensuring safe pregnancy outcomes. In Nigeria, the recommended minimum of four times ANC attendance is underutilized. This study investigates the prevalence and factors associated with underutilization of ANC services with a focus on the differences between rural and urban residences in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey dataset with adjustment for the sampling weight and the cluster design of the survey. The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was assessed using frequency tabulation while associated factors were examined using Chi-Square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was 46.5% in Nigeria, 61.1% in rural residence and 22.4% in urban residence. The North-West region had the highest prevalence of ANC underuse in Nigeria at 69.3%, 76.6% and 44.8% for the overall, rural and urban residences respectively. Factors associated with greater odds of ANC underuse in rural residence were maternal non-working status, birth interval &amp;lt; 24 months, single birth type, not listening to radio at all, lack of companionship to health facility and not getting money for health services. In urban residence, mothers professing Islam, those who did not read newspaper at all, and those who lacked health insurance, had greater odds of ANC underuse. In both rural and urban residence, maternal and husband’s education level, region of residence, wealth index, maternal age, frequency of watching television, distance to- and permission to visit health facility were significantly associated with ANC underuse.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rural-urban differences exist in the use of ANC services, and to varying degrees, factors associated with underuse of ANC in Nigeria. Interventions aimed at addressing factors identified in this study may help to improve the utilization of ANC services both in rural and urban Nigeria. Such interventions need to focus more on reducing socioeconomic, geographic and regional disparities in access to ANC in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>bf46c585</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197324</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761224:93d646dc</id><author><name>Emmanuel Olorunleke Adewuyi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emmanuel Olorunleke Adewuyi, Asa Auta, Vishnu Khanal, Olasunkanmi David Bamidele, Cynthia Pomaa Akuoko, Kazeem Adefemi, Samson Joseph Tapshak, Yun Zhao&lt;/p&gt;

We find that data fusion is critical for these metrics to improve results over the prior state-of-the-art, providing at least ~20% better performance in predicting a compound&apos;s mechanism of action (MoA) and a gene&apos;s pathway.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5938.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Associated patterns of insecticide resistance in field populations of malaria vectors across Africa [Applied Biological Sciences]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5938</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/23/5938/F1.medium.gif</url><height>254</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5938.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>The development of insecticide resistance in African malaria vectors threatens the continued efficacy of important vector control methods that rely on a limited set of insecticides.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was the largest in history. Starting in September 2014, International Medical Corps (IMC) operated five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) in Sierra Leone and Liberia. This paper explores how future infectious disease outbreak facilities in resource-limited settings can be planned, organized, and managed by analyzing data collected on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and infection prevention control (IPC) protocols.&lt;/p&gt; Design/Methodology/Approach &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study by analyzing WASH/IPC activity data routinely recorded on paper forms or white boards at ETUs during the outbreak and later merged into a database from two IMC-run ETUs in Sierra Leone between December 2014 and December 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The IMC WASH/IPC database contains data from over 369 days. Our results highlight parameters key to designing and maintaining an ETU. High concentration chlorine solution usage was highly correlated with both daily patient occupancy and high-risk zone staff entries; low concentration chlorine usage was less well explained by these measures. There is high demand for laundering and disinfecting of personal protective equipment (PPE) on a daily basis and approximately 1 (0–4) piece of PPE is damaged each day.&lt;/p&gt; Research limitations/Implications &lt;p&gt;Lack of standardization in the type and format of data collected at ETUs made constructing the WASH/IPC database difficult.

For example, clustering is often used in the field of single-cell RNA- sequencing in order to identify different cell types present in a tissue sample. There are many algorithms for performing clustering and the results can vary substantially. In particular, the number of groups present in a data set is often unknown and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution we present clustering trees.

For example, clustering is often used in the field of single-cell RNA- sequencing in order to identify different cell types present in a tissue sample. There are many algorithms for performing clustering and the results can vary substantially. In particular, the number of groups present in a data set is often unknown and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution we present clustering trees. This visualisation shows the relationships between clusters at multiple resolutions allowing researchers to see how samples move as the number of clusters increases. In addition, meta-information can be overlaid on the tree to inform the choice of resolution and guide in identification of clusters. We illustrate the features of clustering trees using a series of simulations as well as two real examples, the classical iris dataset and a complex single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset. Clustering trees can be produced using the clustree R package available from CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clustree) and developed on GitHub (https://github.com/lazappi/clustree).</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Cell Biology, Molecular Biology</item></keywords><title>Integrating glucose and fat</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.10.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-j?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525974002000</published><fingerprint>4d45aa9e</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-j?rss=1</link><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7d9:93d646dc</id><author><name>Purnell, B.

Potential confounders (e.g. age, ischemia time, MELD score) were comparable. One-year patient and graft survival were similar. Frequencies of rejections, primary-non function or re-transplantation were not different.

Goat breeding has become an important sector in Eastern Europe, with Romania and Hungary being among the major producer countries. Given the limited number of research done up-to-date concerning genetic studies of indigenous goat breeds reared in Romania and Hungary, the current preliminary study aimed to analyze the variability of genes related to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism by using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP™). We studied 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonging to 19 genes in indigenous breeds from both countries, namely Banat’s White (n = 36), Carpatina (n = 35) from Romania and Hungarian Milking (n = 79) and identified 16 polymorphic SNPs among 10 genes (&lt;i&gt;PTX3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLEC4E&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNFSF13&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TLR3&lt;/i&gt;) in 150 animals. Furthermore, the diversity of the studied breeds was investigated. The PIC values ranged from 0.042 to 0.691. The mean values of observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.235 and 0.246 respectively. The highest observed heterozygosity was obtained for &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T in Banat’s White (0.464), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T in Carpatina (0.577) and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G in Hungarian Milking (0.588). Pairwise F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values between the Romanian breeds and Romanian and Hungarian breeds were small (0.009 and 0.015), indicating the close relationship among the studied goat populations. From all the polymorphic SNPs identified, the Hungarian Milking breed showed the highest proportion of polymorphisms (100%), whereas the Carpatina breed had the lowest percentage (87.5%). The highest value of MAF was obtained for &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G (0.46), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T (0.47), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10344025C&gt;T (0.45), and &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T (0.42). The 16 polymorphic SNPs identified in a panel of 150 unrelated individuals belonging to three Romanian and Hungarian indigenous goat breeds could be used in future genomic based breeding schemes as markers for genetic resistance to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism in goat breeds found in Eastern and Central Europe.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>60f02547</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197051</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bede:2835af05</id><author><name>Daniela Elena Ilie</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Elena Ilie, Szilvia Kusza, Maria Sauer, Dinu Gavojdian&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between experiences of being bullied at school and psychological distress/work engagement, with six steps.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis was conducted for 3,111 workers. The number of respondents who reported being bullied in elementary or junior high school was 1,318 (42%). We found that the experience of being bullied at school was significantly associated with high psychological distress in adulthood (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .079, p = &amp;lt; .0001); however, the work engagement scores of respondents who were bullied were significantly higher than for people who were not bullied at school (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .068, p = &amp;lt; .0001), after adjusting all covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Being bullied at school was positively associated with both psychological distress and work engagement in a sample of workers. Being bullied at school may be a predisposing factor for psychological distress, as previously reported. The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>48429c9d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197168</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559154:93d646dc</id><author><name>Mai Iwanaga</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Iwanaga, Kotaro Imamura, Akihito Shimazu, Norito Kawakami&lt;/p&gt;

To improve the overall welfare levels of sows and to reduce stress levels at late 35-day lactation, we selected targeted behavioral indicators that might be associated with stress. Therefore, we monitored and evaluated the adaptive capability of two different breeds of sows to the farrowing environment. In this study, Damin sows (Large White × Min pig sows, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) and Large White sows (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) were farrowed in individual pens. Saliva was collected and tested for cortisol density at –15 min, and then at +15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min after an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test conducted at 20, 27 and 34 d post-partum. The postures, including ventral and lateral recumbency to other postures, defecating, urinating, sham-chewing and bar-biting behavior, were observed by video from 07:00 to 09:00 and from 13:00 to 15:00 on the 7th day of each week from the 3rd to the 5th week post-parturition. In addition, the concentrations of salivary interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and secretory immunoglobulin (SIgA) were assayed after the observed behaviors. The results showed no significant difference between Damin sows and Large White sows in terms of behaviors at the 3rd week. Additionally, there were no significant differences between Damin and Large White sows in terms of the behaviors of ventral recumbency and bar-biting with the exception of lateral recumbency to other postures, sham-chewing, defecation and urination in the fifth week. Meanwhlie, there was significant difference between two breeds in term of ventral recumbency at the 4th week. The result of the ACTH test showed a significant difference between the Damin and Large White sows by the 27th and 34th days postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In addition, the serological concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were not significantly different between the two breeds at the 3rd week postpartum. However, these indicators were significantly different at the 5th week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.000, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, respectively). The SIgA concentrations in saliva were significantly different between breeds at the 3rd week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In conclusion, both breeds of sows maybe in a state of stress after the 4th week postpartum. However, the Damin sows may be better than the Large White sows in terms of adapting to this farrowing environment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>d6e71953</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197152</link><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd6:2835af05</id><author><name>Honggui Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Honggui Liu, Ran Yi, Chao Wang, Peng Zhao, Mingyue Zhang, Shiwen Xu, Jun Bao&lt;/p&gt;

Together, the data support a unique model of elongation control where non-degradative ubiquitination of nuclear and cytoplasmic 7SK snRNP pools increases P-TEFb levels for transcriptional activation.</description><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31879</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/339234v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><title>Dynamics and spatial genomics of the nascent transcriptome in single mESCs by intron seqFISH [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/05/339234</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/339234v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Recent single cell experiments have revealed significant heterogeneities at the levels of transcription, DNA methylation and chromosome organization in individual cells.

Huntington’s disease (HD) age of onset (AO) is mainly determined by the length of the CAG repeat expansion in the &lt;i&gt;huntingtin&lt;/i&gt; gene. The remaining AO variability has been attributed to other little-known factors. A factor that has been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases is arterial hypertension (AHT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of AHT to the AO of HD. We used data from a cohort of 630 European HD patients with adult onset collected by the REGISTRY project of the European Huntington’s Disease Network. Multiple linear regression and ANOVA, controlling for the CAG repeat number of the expanded allele (CAGexp) of each patient, were performed to assess the association between the AHT condition and the AO of the motor symptoms (mAO). The results showed a significant association between AHT and mAO, especially when we only considered the patients diagnosed with AHT prior to manifesting any HD signs (pre-HD AHT). Remarkably, despite the low number of cases, those patients developed motor symptoms 5–8 years later than normotensive patients in the most frequent CAGexp range (40–44). AHT is an age-related condition and consequently, the age of the patient at the time of data collection could be a confounder variable. However, given that most pre-HD AHT patients included in our study had started treatment with antihypertensive drugs prior to the onset of HD, and that antihypertensive drugs have been suggested to confer a neuroprotective effect in other neurodegenerative diseases, raises the interest in elucidating the impact of AHT and/or AHT treatment in HD age of onset in further studies. A confirmation of our results in a larger sample set would open the possibility to significantly improve HD management.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>42</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>63769804</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197975</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2343:2835af05</id><author><name>Leire Valcárcel-Ocete</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leire Valcárcel-Ocete, Asier Fullaondo, Gorka Alkorta-Aranburu, María García-Barcina, Raymund A.

How distinct molecular compositions are established and maintained in these liquid compartments is unknown.

This study aims to find out the relationship between pet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children aged 0–8 years old in Tianjin, China. Parental or guardians reports of 7360 children were analyzed. 1490 (21.6%) families kept pets at the time of the survey (current), among them 4.0% cats, and 14.7% dogs. For the first year of life of children (early), 1196 (18.4%) families kept pets, and among them 3.2% cats, and 13.7% dogs. Exposure to a pet in early childhood significantly increased the risk of current wheeze, current dry cough, and diagnosed rhinitis. 17.9% of parents reported an avoidance behavior, i.e., had removed or refrained a pet due to asthma or allergy in the family. After adjustment for avoidance behavior, the negative effect of pet keeping on children’s health became even more obvious, with e.g. an AOR of 3.37 (1.58–7.19) for diagnosed asthma, 3.60 (2.07–6.27) for diagnosed rhinitis, 1.92 (1.31–2.81) for diagnosed eczema. A dose-response relationship between pet keeping at current and current wheeze, current eczema and diagnosed eczema was found. In conclusion, pet exposure in early life of children in Tianjin is a risk factor for asthma and allergies among children aged 0–8 years old.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>b4f63486</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197274</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7af:2835af05</id><author><name>Shugang Luo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shugang Luo, Yuexia Sun, Jing Hou, Xiangrui Kong, Pan Wang, Qingnan Zhang, Jan Sundell&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;There is limited data on third-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC). This study was conducted to assess third-line treatment patterns, outcomes, and clinical parameters related to survival outcomes in patients with MGC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database, a nationwide population-based outcomes study was conducted. From the HIRA database, patients newly diagnosed in 2010 with MGC were identified (N = 1,871), and of these, 229 patients who had received third-line chemotherapy were finally selected for this study.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Prior to third-line chemotherapy, more than 90% of patients received fluoropyrimidine and platinum, and 43.7% and 40.6% received taxane and irinotecan, respectively. Various third-line chemotherapy regimens containing taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel), irinotecan, or oxaliplatin were prescribed. The median overall survival (OS) of all patients receiving third-line chemotherapy was 4.4 months. The median time from the start date of first-line chemotherapy to the start date of third-line chemotherapy (TF1T3) was 9.5 months, and a longer TF1T3 was the only factor that was significantly associated with an increased OS. The median OS of patients who had received fluoropyrimidine, platinum, and taxane followed by third-line irinotecan-based therapy was similar to that of patients who had received fluoropyrimidine, platinum, and irinotecan followed by third-line taxane-based therapy (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.894).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In patients with MGC receiving third-line chemotherapy, TF1T3 was the only significant factor associated with OS. The sequence of using taxane and irinotecan as subsequent therapy after first-line failure was not shown to impact survival outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>53ef8f73</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198544</link><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:668334c:3dd877af</id><author><name>In Sil Choi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by In Sil Choi, Mihong Choi, Ju Hyun Lee, Jee Hyun Kim, Koung Jin Suh, Ji Yun Lee, Beodeul Kang, Ji-Won Kim, Se-Hyun Kim, Jin Won Kim, Jeong-Ok Lee, Yu Jung Kim, Soo-Mee Bang, Jong Seok Lee, Keun-Wook Lee&lt;/p&gt;

The sequence of using taxane and irinotecan as subsequent therapy after first-line failure was not shown to impact survival outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/B3aTIEP8ihY/s41598-018-25860-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25860-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25860-4</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25860-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25860-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/B3aTIEP8ihY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525762800000</published><fingerprint>c84a565a</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25860-4</link><crawled>1525767537712</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633ed50430:ceec1:3dd877af</id><author><name>Gökhan Karaova</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25860-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25860-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/B3aTIEP8ihY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/7FxKkfYVFfo/acs.jpcb.8b01034</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Dimerization and Conformational Exchanges of the Receiver Domain of Response Regulator PhoB from Escherichia coli</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01034/20180515/images/medium/jp-2018-01034b_0005.gif</url><height>280</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01034</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01034</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01034/20180515/images/medium/jp-2018-01034b_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01034&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Despite their demonstrated biocompatibility and osteogenic properties, oyster shells have been reported as a potential alternative to other commonly used materials for bone substitution. This study evaluated whether an experimental bone substitute (EBS) made from a typical oyster shell of Northeastern Brazil (&lt;i&gt;Crassostrea rhizophora&lt;/i&gt;) has effects on bone development using an animal model. Oysters were collected from a biologically assisted vivarium, and their inner layer was used for preparing an EBS. Chemical and surface characterization of EBS was performed using Individually Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), respectively. Seventy-two rats were randomly assigned to groups according to the treatment of bone defects created in the submandibular area: Negative Control (-C), Positive Control (+C; Bio-Oss&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) and EBS. Euthanasia occurred at 7, 21, 42 and 56 days postoperatively. The bone pieces were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E). The formation of bone tissue was evaluated histologically and histomorphometrically. Data were analyzed through the Kruskal-Wallis test and ANOVA considering a significant level of 5%. The main element found in EBS was calcium (71.68%), and it presented heterogeneity in the particle size and a porosity aspect at SEM analysis. Histological results revealed the absence of inflammatory cells in all groups, being that EBS presented the most accelerated process of bone formation with a statistically significant difference between this group and the +C and -C groups in the 21-day time-point (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). After 21 days, the bone formation process was similar between all groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.05), showing an immature lamellar bone pattern after 56 days of experimentation (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.05). Within the limitations of this study, it was possible to conclude that EBS presented good biocompatibility and promoted fast stimulation for bone-forming cells in an animal model.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>c7e55277</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198697</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd8:3dd877af</id><author><name>Ricardo Coringa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ricardo Coringa, Eduardo Martins de Sousa, Juliana Nunes Botelho, Rafael Soares Diniz, Joicy Cortez de Sá, Maria Carmen Fontoura Nogueira da Cruz, Marco Aurelio Beninni Paschoal, Letícia Machado Gonçalves&lt;/p&gt;

However, the actual state of the body of bioinformatics software remains largely unknown. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the state of source code in the bioinformatics community, specifically looking at relationships between code properties, development activity, developer communities, and software impact. To investigate these issues, we curated a list of 1,720 bioinformatics repositories on GitHub through their mention in peer-reviewed bioinformatics articles. Additionally, we included 23 high-profile repositories identified by their popularity in an online bioinformatics forum. We analyzed repository metadata, source code, development activity, and team dynamics using data made available publicly through the GitHub API, as well as article metadata. We found key relationships within our dataset, including: certain scientific topics are associated with more active code development and higher community interest in the repository; most of the code in the main dataset is written in dynamically typed languages, while most of the code in the high-profile set is statically typed; developer team size is associated with community engagement and high-profile repositories have larger teams; the proportion of female contributors decreases for high-profile repositories and with seniority level in author lists; and, multiple measures of project impact are associated with the simple variable of whether the code was modified at all after paper publication. In addition to providing the first large-scale analysis of bioinformatics code to our knowledge, our work will enable future analysis through publicly available data, code, and methods.

Although previous studies have established that N-BPs function by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in osteoclasts, the mechanism by which N-BPs enter the cytosol from the extracellular space to reach their molecular target is not understood. Here we implemented a CRISPRi-mediated genome-wide screen and identified &lt;i&gt;SLC37A3&lt;/i&gt; (solute carrier family 37 member A3) as a gene required for the action of N-BPs in mammalian cells.

Although previous studies have established that N-BPs function by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in osteoclasts, the mechanism by which N-BPs enter the cytosol from the extracellular space to reach their molecular target is not understood. Here we implemented a CRISPRi-mediated genome-wide screen and identified &lt;i&gt;SLC37A3&lt;/i&gt; (solute carrier family 37 member A3) as a gene required for the action of N-BPs in mammalian cells. We observed that SLC37A3 forms a complex with ATRAID (all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation factor), a previously identified genetic target of N-BPs.

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony.

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. The long-lasting desynchronizing impact of CR stimulation has been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. However, as yet it is unclear how to optimally choose the CR stimulation frequency, i.e. the repetition rate at which the CR stimuli are delivered. This work presents the first computational study on the dependence of the acute and long-term outcome on the CR stimulation frequency in neuronal networks with STDP.

&lt;i&gt;Arachis hypogaea&lt;/i&gt; L. geocarpy is a unique feature different from other legume plants. Flowering and fertilization occur above ground, while the following processes of pod formation and development proceed in the soil. The zygote divides only few times to develop into pre-embryo and then further embryo developmental process stops when the gynoecium is exposed to light condition or normal day/night period. In this study, eight phytochrome genes were identified in two wild peanuts (four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis ipaensis&lt;/i&gt;). Using RACE and homologous cloning, the full CDS of &lt;i&gt;AhphyA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyA-like&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AhphyE&lt;/i&gt; were acquired in cultivated peanut. Protein structure analysis showed that the conservative coding domains of phytochromes from a number of other plant species were found in these proteins. The C-terminal of AhphyA, AhphyA-like and AhphyB could interact with phytochrome-interacting factor 3 in vitro. The expression patterns of these genes in various tissues were analyzed by qRT-PCR, and significant differences were observed.

Furthermore, protein accumulation patterns of AhphyA and AhphyB in gynophore were different during early pod development stages in that AhphyA and AhphyB proteins were not detected in S1 and S2 gynophores, while significant accumulation of AhphyA and AhphyB were detected in S3 gynophore.

&lt;i&gt;Arachis hypogaea&lt;/i&gt; L. geocarpy is a unique feature different from other legume plants. Flowering and fertilization occur above ground, while the following processes of pod formation and development proceed in the soil. The zygote divides only few times to develop into pre-embryo and then further embryo developmental process stops when the gynoecium is exposed to light condition or normal day/night period. In this study, eight phytochrome genes were identified in two wild peanuts (four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis ipaensis&lt;/i&gt;). Using RACE and homologous cloning, the full CDS of &lt;i&gt;AhphyA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyA-like&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AhphyE&lt;/i&gt; were acquired in cultivated peanut. Protein structure analysis showed that the conservative coding domains of phytochromes from a number of other plant species were found in these proteins. The C-terminal of AhphyA, AhphyA-like and AhphyB could interact with phytochrome-interacting factor 3 in vitro. The expression patterns of these genes in various tissues were analyzed by qRT-PCR, and significant differences were observed. Interestingly, the expression levels of &lt;i&gt;AhphyA-like&lt;/i&gt; changed significantly during gynophore growth and early pod development. Furthermore, protein accumulation patterns of AhphyA and AhphyB in gynophore were different during early pod development stages in that AhphyA and AhphyB proteins were not detected in S1 and S2 gynophores, while significant accumulation of AhphyA and AhphyB were detected in S3 gynophore. These results provided evidence that phytochromes mediated light signal transduction may play key roles in peanut geocarpy development.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198526</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Resistome of carbapenem- and colistin-resistant &amp;lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&amp;lt;/i&gt; clinical isolates</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198526</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Lomonaco, Matthew A.

The emergence and dissemination of carbapenemases, bacterial enzymes able to inactivate most β-lactam antibiotics, in &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; is of increasing concern. The concurrent spread of resistance against colistin, an antibiotic of last resort, further compounds this challenge further. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can play a significant role in the rapid and accurate detection/characterization of existing and emergent resistance determinants, an essential aspect of public health surveillance and response activities to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. In the current study, WGS data was used to characterize the genomic content of antimicrobial resistance genes, including those encoding carbapenemases, in 10 multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; isolates from Pakistan. These clinical isolates represented five sequence types: ST11 (n = 3 isolates), ST14 (n = 3), ST15 (n = 1), ST101 (n = 2), and ST307 (n = 1). Resistance profiles against 25 clinically-relevant antimicrobials were determined by broth microdilution; resistant phenotypes were observed for at least 15 of the 25 antibiotics tested in all isolates except one. Specifically, 8/10 isolates were carbapenem-resistant and 7/10 isolates were colistin-resistant. The &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;NDM-1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA-48&lt;/sub&gt; carbapenemase genes were present in 7/10 and 5/10 isolates, respectively; including 2 isolates carrying both genes. No plasmid-mediated determinants for colistin resistance (e.g. &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;) were detected, but disruptions and mutations in chromosomal loci (i.e. &lt;i&gt;mgrB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pmrB&lt;/i&gt;) previously reported to confer colistin resistance were observed. A &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA-48&lt;/sub&gt;-carrying IncL/M-type plasmid was found in all &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA-48&lt;/sub&gt;-positive isolates.

Biological systems can share and collectively process information to yield emergent effects, despite inherent noise in communication. While man-made systems often employ intricate structural solutions to overcome noise, the structure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not well understood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of such groups. To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of rumor spreading, in which information from few knowledgeable sources must reliably flow into the rest of the population. We study the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups that lack stable structures to efficiently solve this task. We present an impossibility result which strongly restricts reliable rumor spreading in such groups. Namely, we prove that, in the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the communication, no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which agents have to wait until directly interacting with the sources—a process which requires linear time in the population size. Our results imply that in order to achieve efficient rumor spread a system must exhibit either some degree of structural stability or, alternatively, some facet of the communication which is immune to noise. We then corroborate this claim by providing new analyses of experimental data regarding recruitment in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis niger&lt;/i&gt; desert ants. Finally, in light of our theoretical results, we discuss strategies to overcome noise in other biological systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x-ijtk1KgGA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>898da887</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006195</link><crawled>1528307826116</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163d63ebdc4:1bc492d:a96d255</id><author><name>Lucas Boczkowski</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lucas Boczkowski, Emanuele Natale, Ofer Feinerman, Amos Korman&lt;/p&gt;

Leopard seals are an important Antarctic apex predator that can affect marine ecosystems through local predation. Here we report on the successful use of micro geolocation logging sensor tags to track the movements, and activity, of four leopard seals for trips of between 142–446 days including one individual in two separate years. Whilst the sample size is small the results represent an advance in our limited knowledge of leopard seals. We show the longest periods of tracking of leopard seals’ migratory behaviour between the pack ice, close to the Antarctic continent, and the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. It appears that these tracked animals migrate in a directed manner towards Bird Island and, during their residency, use this as a central place for foraging trips as well as exploiting the local penguin and seal populations. Movements to the South Orkney Islands were also recorded, similar to those observed in other predators in the region including the krill fishery. Analysis of habitat associations, taking into account location errors, indicated the tracked seals had an affinity for shallow shelf water and regions of sea ice. Wet and dry sensors revealed that seals hauled out for between 22 and 31% of the time with maximum of 74 hours and a median of between 9 and 11 hours. The longest period a seal remained in the water was between 13 and 25 days. Fitting GAMMs showed that haul out rates changed throughout the year with the highest values occurring during the summer which has implications for visual surveys. Peak haul out occurred around midday for the months between October and April but was more evenly spread across the day between May and September. The seals’ movements between, and behaviour within, areas important to breeding populations of birds and other seals, coupled with the dynamics of the region’s fisheries, shows an understanding of leopard seal ecology is vital in the management of the Southern Ocean resources.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>43224b4d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197767</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bbc:3dd877af</id><author><name>Iain J.

The potential contribution of biodiversity to ecological intensification in urban agricultural systems has not been investigated. We present monitoring data collected from rice fields in 34 community farms in mega-urban Shanghai, China, from 2001 to 2015, and show that the presence of a border crop of soybeans and neighboring crops (maize, eggplant and Chinese cabbage), both without weed control, increased invertebrate predator abundance, decreased the abundance of pests and dependence on insecticides, and increased grain yield and economic profits. Two 2 year randomized experiments with the low and high diversity practices in the same locations confirmed these results.

The potential contribution of biodiversity to ecological intensification in urban agricultural systems has not been investigated. We present monitoring data collected from rice fields in 34 community farms in mega-urban Shanghai, China, from 2001 to 2015, and show that the presence of a border crop of soybeans and neighboring crops (maize, eggplant and Chinese cabbage), both without weed control, increased invertebrate predator abundance, decreased the abundance of pests and dependence on insecticides, and increased grain yield and economic profits.

The finding of power law scaling in neural recordings lends support to the hypothesis of critical brain dynamics. However, power laws are not unique to critical systems and can arise from alternative mechanisms. Here, we investigate whether a common time-varying external drive to a set of Poisson units can give rise to neuronal avalanches and exhibit apparent criticality. To this end, we analytically derive the avalanche size and duration distributions, as well as additional measures, first for homogeneous Poisson activity, and then for slowly varying inhomogeneous Poisson activity. We show that homogeneous Poisson activity cannot give rise to power law distributions. Inhomogeneous activity can also not generate perfect power laws, but it can exhibit approximate power laws with cutoffs that are comparable to those typically observed in experiments. The mechanism of generating apparent criticality by time-varying external fields, forces or input may generalize to many other systems like dynamics of swarms, diseases or extinction cascades. Here, we illustrate the analytically derived effects for spike recordings &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and discuss approaches to distinguish true from apparent criticality. Ultimately, this requires causal interventions, which allow separating internal system properties from externally imposed ones.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lb6BJ4HT6MU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>83c88968</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006081</link><crawled>1527615681306</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163acfd731a:122df5:ed160cc3</id><author><name>Viola Priesemann</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viola Priesemann, Oren Shriki&lt;/p&gt;

Despite progress toward automated force field parameterization, considerable human expertise is required to develop or extend force fields. In particular, human input has long been required to define atom types, which encode chemically unique environments that determine which parameters must be assigned. However, relying on humans to establish atom types is suboptimal: the resulting atom types are often unjustified from a statistical perspective, leading to over- or under-fitting; they are difficult to extend in a systematic and consistent manner when new chemistries must be modeled or new data becomes available; and human effort is not scalable when force fields must be generated for new (bio)polymers or materials. We aim to replace human specification of atom types with an automated approach, based on solid statistics and driven by experimental and/or quantum chemical reference data. Here, we describe a novel technology for this purpose, termed SMARTY, which generalizes atom typing by using direct chemical perception with SMARTS strings, and adopting a hierarchical approach to type assignment. The SMARTY technology enables creation of a move set in atom-typing space that can be used in a Monte Carlo optimization approach to atom typing. We demonstrate the power of this approach with a fully automated procedure that is able to re-discover human-defined atom types in the traditional small molecule force field parm99/parm@Frosst. Furthermore, we show how an extension of this approach that makes use of SMIRKS strings to match multiple atoms, which we term SMIRKY, allows us to take full advantage of the advances in direct chemical perception for valence types (bonds, angles, and torsions) afforded by the recently-proposed SMIRNOFF direct chemical perception force field typing language.

We assess these approaches using several molecular datasets, including one which covers a diverse molecular subset from DrugBank.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313411v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>3D Shape Modeling for Cell Nuclear Morphological Analysis and Classification [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/16/313411</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313411v2?rss=1</originId><content><content>Quantitative analysis of morphological changes in a cell nucleus is important for understanding of nuclear architecture and their relationship with pathological conditions such as cancer.

It is difficult to target and kill cancer cells. One possible approach is to mutate bacteria to enhance their binding to cancer cells. In the present study, Gram-negative &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and Gram-positive &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; were randomly mutated, and then were positively and negatively selected for binding cancer vs normal cells. With repetitive mutation and selection both bacteria successfully evolved to increase affinity to the pancreatic cancer cell line (Mia PaCa-2) but not normal cells (HPDE: immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells). The mutant &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; strains bound to Mia PaCa-2 cells about 10 and 25 times more than to HPDE cells. The selected &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strain had mutations in biofilm-related genes and the regulatory region for a type I pilus gene. Consistent with type I pili involvement, mannose could inhibit the binding to cells. The results suggest that weak but specific binding is involved in the initial step of adhesion. To test their ability to kill Mia PaCa-2 cells, hemolysin was expressed in the mutant strain. The hemolysin released from the mutant strain was active and could kill Mia PaCa-2 cells. In the case of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, the initial binding to the cells was a weak interaction of the leading pole of the motile bacteria. The frequency of this interaction to Mia PaCa-2 cells dramatically increased in the evolved mutant strain. This mutant strain could also specifically invade beneath Mia PaCa-2 cells and settle there. This type of mutation/selection strategy may be applicable to other combinations of cancer cells and bacterial species.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>6f343aa2</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198157</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b944:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Masaki Osawa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masaki Osawa&lt;/p&gt;

Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris (ARMD) is a major cause of implant failure leading to revision surgery in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties. However, the pathogenesis and its association to implant wear are poorly understood and previous studies have yielded discrepant results. We sought to investigate the associations between histological findings, whole blood and synovial fluid metal ion concentrations and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations in patients with MoM total hip replacements and hip resurfacings revised for ARMD. 107 hips in total were included in our study. Of these, 87 were total hip replacements and 20 were hip resurfacings, respectively. We found that whole blood, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations correlated poorly with histological findings. We suggest that the lack of a clear association between histological findings and wear measures in the present study as well as in previous studies is mostly influenced by variability in patient susceptibility. However, patients presenting with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration had lower chromium concentration in their periprosthetic tissues than patients with no perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. This may reflect the role of metal hypersensitivity in implant failure in these patients. Patients with total hip replacements evinced more necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration in their tissues than patients with hip resurfacings. This suggests that trunnion wear debris is more cytotoxic and/or immunogenic than bearing wear debris leading to higher failure rates seen in patients with total hip replacements.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>56e4495e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197614</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c3:2835af05</id><author><name>Lari Lehtovirta</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lari Lehtovirta, Aleksi Reito, Jyrki Parkkinen, Sirpa Peräniemi, Jouko Vepsäläinen, Antti Eskelinen&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether stopping the effective antibiotic treatment following clinical improvement at Day 7 (Truncated treatment) would be non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 (Continued treatment) in patients with acute pyelonephritis (APN) requiring hospitalization treated with non-fluoroquinolone (non-FQ) antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Hospitalized adult men and non-pregnant women with culture-confirmed APN were eligible for participation after they had clinically improved following empirical or culture-guided treatment with intravenous non-FQ antibiotic(s). We excluded patients with severe sepsis, abscesses, prostatitis, recurrent or catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or urinary tract obstruction. We randomized eligible patients on Day 7 of effective treatment and assessed them at Weeks 1 and 6 after treatment completion. The primary outcome was retreatment for recurrent urinary tract infection. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 15%.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 17, 2015 and August 22, 2016, we randomly allocated 54 patients—27 patients in each arm. Twenty-four (44%) patients were male, and 26 (48%) had diabetes mellitus. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was the most common urinary isolate (47 [87%] patients); 36 (78%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In all, 41 (76%) patients received amikacin-based treatment. At the end of 6 weeks, no patient in the truncated treatment arm required retreatment, whereas 1 patient in the continued treatment arm was retreated. Difference (90% CI) in retreatment was −3.7% (−15.01% to 6.15%). Upper bound of the difference (6.15%) was below the prespecified limit, establishing non-inferiority of truncated treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria at Week 6 was similar between the two arms (3/24 vs. 3/26; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.0). Patients in the truncated treatment arm had significantly shorter hospital stay (8 [7–10] vs. 14 [14–15] days; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and less antibiotic consumption per patient (8.4 ± 2.8 vs. 17.4 ± 8.3 DDDs; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Stopping the effective non-FQ antibiotics following clinical improvement at Day 7 is non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 in selected patients with APN requiring hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;Clinical Trials Registry-India; CTRI/2016/04/006810.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>f16c7cec</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197302</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b0:2835af05</id><author><name>Pavankumar Rudrabhatla</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pavankumar Rudrabhatla, Surendran Deepanjali, Jharna Mandal, Rathinam Palamalai Swaminathan, Tamilarasu Kadhiravan&lt;/p&gt;

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a popular method for measuring transcript abundance. The most commonly used method of interpretation is relative quantification and thus necessitates the use of normalization controls (i.e. reference genes) to standardize transcript abundance. The most popular gene targets for RT-qPCR are housekeeping genes because they are thought to maintain a static transcript level among a variety of samples. However, more recent studies have shown, several housekeeping genes are not reliably stable. This is the first study to examine the potential of several reference genes for use in RT-qPCR normalization during barley malting. The process of malting barley mechanizes the imbibition and subsequent germination of barley seeds under controlled conditions. Malt quality is controlled by many pleiotropic genes that are determined by examining the result of physiological changes the barley seed undergoes during the malting process. We compared the stability of 13 reference genes across both two-and six-row malting barleys (Conrad and Legacy, respectfully) throughout the entirety of the malting process. Initially, primer target specificity, amplification efficiency and average Ct values were determined for each of the selected primer pairs. Three statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to rank the stability of each reference gene. Rankings were similar between the two- and six-row with the exception of BestKeeper’s ranking of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;). A consensus ranking among programs was determined using RefFinder. Our results show that Actin (A&lt;i&gt;CT&lt;/i&gt;) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (&lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) were the most stable throughout micromalting, while &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and Cyclophilin (&lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) were the least stable. Two reference genes are necessary for stable transcript normalization according to geNorm and the best two reference genes (&lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) provided a sufficient level of stability.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>21a79cef</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196966</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47505c:2835af05</id><author><name>Jason G.

We need all the reality checks we can get, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/423&quot;&gt;and this one&lt;/a&gt; (reported by a large multinational team led out of Oxford) uses light scattering to get more mass resolution than I would have thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light scattering by small particles depends on their refractive index and the particle volume. Proteins have basically the same refractive index (the indices of the individual amino acids don’t vary that much, and it’s all averaged out). Likewise, the volume occupied by each amino acid is very similar as well, and putting these together means that if you do very accurate light scattering measurements (using interferometry) the signal you get should be proportional to the number of amino acid residues or the total mass. This effect has been predicted, but recent improvements in instrumentation have made it possible to actually observe this and use it in real applications. The group gives the technique the deliberately memorable name of iSCAMS (interferometric scattering mass spectrometry), and we’ll have to get used to the idea of being able to do “mass spec” with a microscope and visible light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over a range of proteins (both monomers and larger oligomers), the team found a very good correlation (within 1.8%, plus or minus half a per cent) between the interferomic signature and protein mass, one that (importantly) was not influenced by the three-dimensional shape of the protein itself. The correlation also held for lipid nanodisc species, which is a good sign. And since I was writing just the other day about glycosylated proteins, I note that they also observed various states of a highly glycosylated (up to half the molecular weight) HIV envelope complex, and could spot the differences there as well. So it look like the effect holds for a number of different biomolecule types, although I expect that there will be refinements to the scattering models for these as the technique is developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like it could be a very good technique for studying protein-protein interactions &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and it has the potential advantage of spatial resolution as well. I’m not sure if you could ever get something like this to work in a living cell (the signal/noise would be a huge problem), but there’s a lot of biomolecular behavior that you could get new details on short of that. There are a lot of variations to try, such as different surfaces, and immobilized binding partners. This could be a good complement to techniques like SPR, only this time at a single-protein level. It’ll be interesting to see if it can get to the point of delivering on- and off-rates, which is one of SPR’s great advantages. As it stands now, the resolution of iSCAMS doesn’t seem good enough to detect small-molecule binding to individual proteins, but it could certainly pick up small molecule effects on protein complexes, and presumably effects on protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-polysaccharide interactions as well.

Population dynamics in urban and rural areas are different. Understanding factors that contribute to local population changes has various socioeconomic and political implications. In the present study, we use population census data in Japan to examine contributors to the population growth of residential clusters between years 2005 and 2010. The data set covers the entirety of Japan and has a high spatial resolution of 500 × 500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, enabling us to examine population dynamics in various parts of the country (urban and rural) using statistical analysis. We found that, in addition to the area, population density, and age, the shape of the cluster and the spatial distribution of inhabitants within the cluster are significantly related to the population growth rate of a residential cluster. Specifically, the population tends to grow if the cluster is &amp;quot;round&amp;quot; shaped (given the area) and the population is concentrated near the center rather than periphery of the cluster. Combination of the present results and analysis framework with other factors that have been omitted in the present study, such as migration, terrain, and transportation infrastructure, will be fruitful.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>a0d3a3a3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197144</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee5:2835af05</id><author><name>Takuya Sekiguchi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takuya Sekiguchi, Kohei Tamura, Naoki Masuda&lt;/p&gt;

Intermittent water supplies (IWS) deliver piped water to one billion people; this water is often microbially contaminated. Contaminants that accumulate while IWS are depressurized are flushed into customers’ homes when these systems become pressurized. In addition, during the steady-state phase of IWS, contaminants from higher-pressure sources (e.g., sewers) may continue to intrude where pipe pressure is low. To guide the operation and improvement of IWS, this paper proposes an analytic model relating supply pressure, supply duration, leakage, and the volume of intruded, potentially-contaminated, fluids present during flushing and steady-state. The proposed model suggests that increasing the supply duration may improve water quality during the flushing phase, but decrease the subsequent steady-state water quality. As such, regulators and academics should take more care in reporting if water quality samples are taken during flushing or steady-state operational conditions. Pipe leakage increases with increased supply pressure and/or duration. We propose using an equivalent orifice area (EOA) to quantify pipe quality. This provides a more stable metric for regulators and utilities tracking pipe repairs. Finally, we show that the volume of intruded fluid decreases in proportion to reductions in EOA. The proposed relationships are applied to self-reported performance indicators for IWS serving 108 million people described in the IBNET database and in the Benchmarking and Data Book of Water Utilities in India. This application shows that current high-pressure, continuous water supply targets will require extensive EOA reductions. For example, in order to achieve national targets, utilities in India will need to reduce their EOA by a median of at least 90%.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated><fingerprint>e8c43234</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196887</link><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721a:2835af05</id><author><name>David D.

Background &lt;p&gt;In order to compute the continuum of care for French Guiana, it is necessary to estimate the total number of persons living with HIV. The main objective was to determine how many persons were infected with HIV and how many were unaware of it.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used 2 different models to calculate the total number of persons infected with HIV: Spectrum’s AIM module using CSAVR to compute incidence from case registration and vital statistics; and the ECDC model from the French Guiana HIV cohort data.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;The present results show that both models led to similar results regarding the incident number of cases (i.e. for 2016 174 versus 161) and the total HIV population (in 2016 3206 versus 3539) respectively. The ECDC modeling tool showed that the proportion of undiagnosed HIV infections declined from 50% in 1990 to 15% in 2015. This amounted to a stable or slightly increasing total number of undiagnosed patients of 520.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The estimations of the total HIV population by both models show that the HIV population is still growing. The incidence rate declined in 2000 and the decline of the number of newly acquired HIV infections, after a decline after 2003 is offset by population growth. The proportion of undiagnosed infections has declined to 15% but the number of undiagnosed infections remains stable.

The main objective was to determine how many persons were infected with HIV and how many were unaware of it.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used 2 different models to calculate the total number of persons infected with HIV: Spectrum’s AIM module using CSAVR to compute incidence from case registration and vital statistics; and the ECDC model from the French Guiana HIV cohort data.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;The present results show that both models led to similar results regarding the incident number of cases (i.e. for 2016 174 versus 161) and the total HIV population (in 2016 3206 versus 3539) respectively. The ECDC modeling tool showed that the proportion of undiagnosed HIV infections declined from 50% in 1990 to 15% in 2015. This amounted to a stable or slightly increasing total number of undiagnosed patients of 520.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The estimations of the total HIV population by both models show that the HIV population is still growing. The incidence rate declined in 2000 and the decline of the number of newly acquired HIV infections, after a decline after 2003 is offset by population growth. The proportion of undiagnosed infections has declined to 15% but the number of undiagnosed infections remains stable. The HIV cascade shows that despite good results for treatment in care, reaching the 90*90*90 UNAIDS target may be difficult because a significant proportion of patients are lost to follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197823</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Phenotypic characterization of aberrant stem and progenitor cell populations in myelodysplastic syndromes</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197823</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197823</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin N.

Recent reports have revealed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to arise from cancer stem cells phenotypically similar to physiological hematopoietic stem cells. Myelodysplastic hematopoiesis maintains a hierarchical organization, but the proportion of several hematopoietic compartments is skewed and multiple surface markers are aberrantly expressed. These aberrant antigen expression patterns hold diagnostic and therapeutic promise. However, eradication of MDS requires targeting of early myelodysplasia propagating stem cells. This warrants an exact assessment of the differentiation stage at which aberrant expression occurs in transformed hematopoiesis. Here, we report results on the prospective and extensive dissection of the hematopoietic hierarchy in 20 patients with either low-risk MDS or MDS with excess blasts and compare it to hematopoiesis in patients with non-malignancy-associated cytopenia or B cell lymphoma without bone marrow infiltration. We found patients with MDS with excess blasts to exhibit characteristic expansions of specific immature progenitor compartments. We also identified the aberrant expression of several markers including ALDH, CLL-1, CD44, and CD47 to be specific features of hematopoiesis in MDS with excess blasts. We show that amongst these, aberrant CLL-1 expression manifested at the early uncommitted hematopoietic stem cell level, suggesting a potential role as a therapeutic target.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>a5bc00f0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197823</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd77:3dd877af</id><author><name>Benjamin N.

Background &lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates (UAE) exhibits alarming high prevalence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and their risk factors. Emerging evidence highlighted the role of maternal and early child nutrition in preventing later-onset NCDs. The objectives of this article are to describe the design and methodology of the first Mother and Infant Study Cohort (MISC) in UAE; present the baseline demographic characteristics of the study participants; and discuss the challenges of the cohort and their respective responding strategies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The MISC is an ongoing two-year prospective cohort study which recruited Arab pregnant women in their third trimester from prenatal clinics in Dubai, Sharjah and Ajman. Participants will be interviewed six times (once during pregnancy, at delivery, and at 2, 6, 12 and 24months postpartum). Perinatal information is obtained from hospital records. Collected data include socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, dietary intake and anthropometry; infant feeding practices, cognitive development; along with maternal and infant blood profile and breast milk profile.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The preliminary results reported that 256 completed baseline assessment (mean age: 30.5±6.0 years; 76.6% multiparous; about 60% were either overweight or obese before pregnancy). The prevalence of gestational diabetes was 19.2%. Upon delivery, 208 women-infant pairs were retained (mean gestational age: 38.5±1.5 weeks; 33.3% caesarean section delivery; 5.3% low birthweight; 5.7% macrosomic deliveries). Besides participant retention, the main encountered challenges pertained to cultural complexity, underestimation the necessary start-up time, staff, and costs, and biochemical data collection.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Despite numerous methodological, logistical and sociocultural challenges, satisfactory follow-up rates are recorded.

Inadequate care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and may be associated with adverse outcomes after dialysis. The nationwide pre-end-stage renal disease pay for performance program (P4P) has been implemented in Taiwan to improve quality of CKD care. However, the effectiveness of the P4P program in improving the outcomes of pre-dialysis care and dialysis is uncertain. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study. Patients who newly underwent long-term dialysis (≥3 mo) between 2007 and 2009 were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Based on the patient enrolment of the P4P program, they were categorized into P4P or non-P4P groups. We analysed pre-dialysis care, healthcare expenditures, and mortality between two groups. Among the 26 588 patients, 25.5% participated in the P4P program. The P4P group received significantly better quality of care, including a higher frequency of glomerular filtration rate measurement and CKD complications survey, a higher rate of vascular access preparation, and more frequent use of arteriovenous fistulas than the non-P4P group did. The P4P group had a 68.4% reduction of the 4-year total healthcare expenditure (excluding dialysis fee), which is equivalent to US$345.7 million, and a significant 22% reduction in three-year mortality after dialysis (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.75–0.82, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with the non-P4P group. P4P program improves quality of pre-dialysis CKD care, and provide survival benefit and a long-term cost saving for dialysis patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>6b5d0169</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198387</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a8454a:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Ming-Yen Lin</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ming-Yen Lin, Li-Jen Cheng, Yi-Wen Chiu, Hui-Min Hsieh, Ping-Hsun Wu, Yi-Ting Lin, Shu-Li Wang, Feng-Xuan Jian, Chih Cheng Hsu, Shu-An Yang, Huei-Lan Lee, Shang-Jyh Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

P4P program improves quality of pre-dialysis CKD care, and provide survival benefit and a long-term cost saving for dialysis patients.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322883v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><title>Improving the consistency of functional genomics screens using molecular features - a multi-omics, pan-cancer study [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/15/322883</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322883v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Probing the genetic dependencies of cancer cells helps understand the tumor biology and identify potential drug targets.

Background &lt;p&gt;Radiation pneumonitis is a common and serious complication of radiotherapy. Many published randomized controlled studies (RCTs) reveal a growing trend of using herbal medicines as adjuvant therapy to prevent radiation pneumonitis; however, their efficacy and safety remain unexplored.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines as adjunctive therapy for the prevention of radiation pneumonitis in patients with lung cancer who undergo radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We searched the following 11 databases: three English medical databases [MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)], five Korean medical databases (Korean Studies Information, Research information Service System, KoreaMed, DBPIA, National Digital Science Library), and three Chinese medical databases [the China National Knowledge Database (CNKI), Journal Integration Platform (VIP), and WanFang Database]. The primary outcome was the incidence of radiation pneumonitis. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-two RCTs involving 1819 participants were included. The methodological quality was poor for most of the studies. Meta-analysis showed that herbal medicines combined with radiotherapy significantly reduced the incidence of radiation pneumonitis (n = 1819; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.45–0.63, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 8%) and the incidence of severe radiation pneumonitis (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 903; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11–0.41, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). Combined therapy also improved the Karnofsky performance score (n = 420; WMD 4.62, 95% CI 1.05–8.18, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 82%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;There is some encouraging evidence that oral administration of herbal medicines combined with radiotherapy may benefit patients with lung cancer by preventing or minimizing radiation pneumonitis.

Our proposed algorithm uses fewer computational resources than common distributed graph search algorithms, and thus may be useful in other domains, such as for swarm computing or for coordinating molecular robots.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00139</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acscii</streamId><title>ACS Central Science: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Slow Dynamics around a Protein and Its Coupling to Solvent</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00139/20180509/images/medium/oc-2018-00139q_0006.gif</url><height>261</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00139</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00139/20180509/images/medium/oc-2018-00139q_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00139&lt;/div&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525838400000</published><fingerprint>b1130cec</fingerprint><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00139</link><crawled>1525890853526</crawled><id>1TYkl+7D2jbCAjv6kqe9qy39+K76tsp7YKV/mQVt7ps=_163462eaa96:1b0719:d63e3ae2</id><author><name>Yun-Hsuan Kuo, Yun-Wei Chiang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00139/20180509/images/medium/oc-2018-00139q_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00139&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5829.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Importance of dispersal in the assembly of the Neotropical biota [Evolution]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5829</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5829.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>The origin of Neotropical diversity has intrigued scientists since Humboldt and Wallace.

Adult male C57BL/6J mice have previously been reported to have motor and memory deficits after experimental closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI), without associated gross pathologic damage or neuroimaging changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging protocols. The presence of neurologic deficits, however, suggests neural damage or dysfunction in these animals. Accordingly, we undertook a histologic analysis of mice after TBI. Gross pathology and histologic analysis using Nissl stain and NeuN immunohistochemistry demonstrated no obvious tissue damage or neuron loss. However, Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed myelin injury in the optic tract, while Fluoro Jade B and silver degeneration staining revealed evidence of axonal neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and superior colliculus (detectable at 7 days, but not 24 hours, after injury). Fluoro Jade B staining was not detectable in other white matter tracts, brain regions or in cell somata. In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>27565fc4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197346</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559161:93d646dc</id><author><name>Nathan K.

Human alveolar macrophages (HAM) are primary bacterial niche and immune response cells during &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb)&lt;/i&gt; infection, and human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are a model for investigating &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt;-macrophage interactions. Here, we use a targeted RNA-Seq method to measure transcriptome-wide changes in RNA expression patterns of freshly obtained HAM (used within 6 h) and 6 day cultured MDM upon &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; infection over time (2, 24 and 72 h), in both uninfected and infected cells from three donors each. The Ion AmpliSeq™ Transcriptome Human Gene Expression Kit (AmpliSeq) uses primers targeting 18,574 mRNAs and 2,228 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) for a total of 20,802 transcripts. AmpliSeq&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; yields highly precise and reproducible gene expression profiles (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt;0.99). Taking advantage of AmpliSeq’s reproducibility, we establish well-defined quantitative RNA expression patterns of HAM &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; MDM, including significant &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb-&lt;/i&gt;inducible genes, in networks and pathways that differ in part between MDM and HAM. A similar number of expressed genes are detected at all time-points between uninfected MDM and HAM, in common pathways including inflammatory and immune functions, but canonical pathway differences also exist. In particular, at 2 h, multiple genes relevant to the immune response are preferentially expressed in either uninfected HAM or MDM, while the HAM RNA profiles approximate MDM profiles over time in culture, highlighting the unique RNA expression profile of freshly obtained HAM. MDM demonstrate a greater transcriptional response than HAM upon &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; infection, with 2 to &gt;10 times more genes up- or down-regulated. The results identify key genes involved in cellular responses to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; in two different human macrophage types. Follow-up bioinformatics analysis indicates that approximately 30% of response genes have expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs in GTEx), common DNA variants that can influence host gene expression susceptibility or resistance to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt;, illustrated with the &lt;i&gt;TREM1&lt;/i&gt; gene cluster and &lt;i&gt;IL-10&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>3bc35416</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198221</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb925:3dd877af</id><author><name>Audrey C.

The spindle pole body (SPB) plays a central role in spore plasma membrane formation in addition to its recognized role in microtubule organization. During meiosis, a biomembrane called the forespore membrane (FSM) is newly formed at the SPB. Although several SPB proteins essential for the initiation of FSM formation (meiotic SPB components) have been identified, the molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of Dms1 as a component of the SPB. We show that FSM formation does not initiate in &lt;i&gt;dms1Δ&lt;/i&gt; cells. Dms1 protein is constitutively expressed throughout the life cycle and localizes to the SPB and the nuclear envelope. The predicted Dms1 protein has a transmembrane domain, which is required for correct localization at the SPB. Dms1 is essential for the proper localization of three meiotic SPB components, Spo15, Spo2, and Spo13, but these components do not affect localization of Dms1. Collectively, these results suggest that Dms1 anchors these meiotic SPB components to the SPB, thereby facilitating the initiation of FSM formation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>689267b2</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197879</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c14:3dd877af</id><author><name>Touko Niimi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Touko Niimi, Taro Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

Collectively, these results suggest that Dms1 anchors these meiotic SPB components to the SPB, thereby facilitating the initiation of FSM formation.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198725</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Assessing the perspectives of users and beneficiaries of a community health worker mHealth tracking system for mothers and children in Rwanda</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198725</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198725</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Angele Musabyimana, Hinda Ruton, Erick Gaju, Atakilt Berhe, Karen A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Mobile Health (mHealth) programs have increasingly been used to tackle maternal and child health problems in low and middle income countries. However, few studies have evaluated how these programs have been perceived by intended users and beneficiaries. Therefore, we explored perceptions of healthcare officials and beneficiaries regarding RapidSMS Rwanda, an mHealth system used by Community Health Workers (CHWs) that was scaled up nationwide in 2013.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders, providers, and beneficiaries of maternal and child health services at both the national and community levels. Semi-structured interviews were used to assess perceptions about the impact of and challenges facing the RapidSMS system. Interviews and focus group discussions were recorded (with the exception of one), transcribed verbatim, and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We conducted a total of 28 in-depth interviews and 10 focus group discussions (93 total participants). A majority of respondents believed that RapidSMS contributed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. RapidSMS was generally accepted by both CHWs and parents. Participants identified insufficient training, a lack of equipment, and low CHW motivation as the main challenges facing RapidSMS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that an mHealth program can be well accepted by both policymakers, health providers, and the community. We also found significant technical challenges that have likely reduced its impact. Addressing these challenges will serve to strengthen future mHealth programs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>f767e69b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198725</link><crawled>1528394402297</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db67c9f9:679b313:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Angele Musabyimana</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Angele Musabyimana, Hinda Ruton, Erick Gaju, Atakilt Berhe, Karen A.

Gelsolin (GSN) protein, expressed in circulating monocytes, was previously reported to be associated with osteoporosis in both Chinese and Caucasian women. This study aims to test if plasma GSN protein level is associated with hip bone mineral density (BMD) in Chinese population. Based on two study Groups containing 6,308 old Chinese, we adopted extreme sampling scheme and selected 3 independent samples (Subgroups 1–3) for discovery, replication, and validation purposes. We tested plasma GSN concentration, and analyzed whether plasma GSN level differs between subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD. In Group 1 (N = 1,860), the plasma GSN level increased in the female with low BMD, which was discovered in the Subgroup 1 (N = 42, p = 0.093) and replicated in the Subgroup 2 (N = 39, p = 0.095). With more extreme sampling for the Subgroup 3 from the Group 2 (N = 4,448), the difference of plasma GSN level in the female with low BMD vs. high BMD is more significant (N = 45, p = 0.037). After the subjects were pooled from Subgroups 2 and 3, the difference in plasma GSN between low and high BMD subjects became even more significant (p = 0.016). The plasma GSN level was negatively correlated with total hip BMD (r = -0.26, p = 0.033). We concluded that plasma GSN was associated with hip BMD in Chinese postmenopausal women and plasma GSN might be a potential risk biomarker for osteoporosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>c1dfe5c7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197732</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094065:2835af05</id><author><name>Wen-Yu Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Yu Wang, Bing Ge, Ju Shi, Xu Zhou, Long-Fei Wu, Chang-Hua Tang, Dong-Cheng Zhu, Hong Zhu, Xing-Bo Mo, Yong-Hong Zhang, Fei-Yan Deng, Shu-Feng Lei&lt;/p&gt;

Mortality information of populations is aggregated in life tables that serve as a basis for calculation of life expectancy and various life disparity measures. Conventional life-table methods address right-censoring inadequately by assuming a constant hazard in the last open-ended age group. As a result, life expectancy can be substantially distorted, especially in the case when the last age group in a life table contains a large proportion of the population. Previous research suggests addressing censoring in a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model setting as this framework incorporates all major features of adult mortality. In this article, we quantify the difference between gamma-Gompertz-Makeham life expectancy values and those published in the largest publicly available high-quality life-table databases for human populations, drawing attention to populations for which life expectancy values should be reconsidered. We also advocate the use of gamma-Gompertz-Makeham life expectancy for three reasons. First, model-based life-expectancy calculation successfully handles the problem of data quality or availability, resulting in severe censoring due to the unification of a substantial number of deaths in the last open-end age group. Second, model-based life expectancies are preferable in the case of data scarcity, i.e. when data contain numerous age groups with zero death counts: here, we provide an example of hunter-gatherer populations. Third, gamma-Gompertz-Makeham-based life expectancy values are almost identical to the ones provided by the major high-quality human mortality databases that use more complicated procedures. Applying a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model to adult mortality data can be used to revise life-expectancy trends for historical populations that usually serve as input for mortality forecasts.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>3c6b3a06</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198485</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b790:3dd877af</id><author><name>László Németh</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by László Németh, Trifon I.

Ischemic stroke remains an important cause of disability and mortality. Hypertension is a critical risk factor for the development of ischemic stroke. Control of risk factors, including hypertension, is therefore important for the prevention of ischemic stroke. Linalyl acetate (LA) has been reported to have therapeutic effects in ischemic stroke by modulating intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and having anti-oxidative properties. The preventive efficacy of LA has not yet been determined. This study therefore investigated the preventive efficacy of LA in rat aortas exposed to hypertension related-ischemic injury, and the mechanism of action of LA.Hypertension was induced &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; following ischemic injury to the aorta induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Effects of LA were assayed by western blotting, by determining concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by vascular contractility assays. LA significantly reduced systolic blood pressure &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, LA suppressed ischemic injury-induced expression of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit p47&lt;sup&gt;phox&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as ROS production, LDH release, and ROS-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase suppression. These findings indicate that LA has anti-hypertensive properties that can prevent hypertension-related ischemic injury and can prevent NADPH oxidase-induced production of ROS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>5334af14</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198082</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd84:3dd877af</id><author><name>Yu Shan Hsieh</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Shan Hsieh, Soonho Kwon, Hui Su Lee, Geun Hee Seol&lt;/p&gt;

Transglutaminases (TGases) are enzymes that catalyse protein cross-linking through a transamidation reaction between the side chain of a glutamine residue on one protein and the side chain of a lysine residue on another. Generally, TGases show low substrate specificity with respect to their amine substrate, such that a wide variety of primary amines can participate in the modification of specific glutamine residue. Although a number of different TGases have been used to mediate these bioconjugation reactions, the TGase from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; (bTG) may be particularly suited to this application. It is smaller than most TGases, can be expressed in a soluble active form, and lacks the calcium dependence of its mammalian counterparts. However, little is known regarding this enzyme and its glutamine substrate specificity, limiting the scope of its application. In this work, we designed a FRET-based ligation assay to monitor the bTG-mediated conjugation of the fluorescent proteins Clover and mRuby2. This assay allowed us to screen a library of random heptapeptide glutamine sequences for their reactivity with recombinant bTG in bacterial cells, using fluorescence assisted cell sorting. From this library, several reactive sequences were identified and kinetically characterized, with the most reactive sequence (YAHQAHY) having a k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; value of 19 ± 3 μM&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that visual cortex engages in spatio-temporal sequence learning and prediction. The cellular basis of this learning remains unclear, however. Here we present a spiking neural network model that explains a recent study on sequence learning in the primary visual cortex of rats. The model posits that the sequence learning and prediction abilities of cortical circuits result from the interaction of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. It also reproduces changes in stimulus-evoked multi-unit activity during learning. Furthermore, it makes precise predictions regarding how training shapes network connectivity to establish its prediction ability. Finally, it predicts that the adapted connectivity gives rise to systematic changes in spontaneous network activity. Taken together, our model establishes a new conceptual bridge between the structure and function of cortical circuits in the context of sequence learning and prediction.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zOLtDY7_1Wk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>452d7645</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006187</link><crawled>1528220849540</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163d10f9584:14e7082:a96d255</id><author><name>Christian Klos</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Klos, Daniel Miner, Jochen Triesch&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Cancer and factor V Leiden mutation are both risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Cancer critically increases the thrombotic risk whereas Factor V Leiden is the most common pro-thrombotic mutation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cancer and factor V Leiden mutation are both risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Cancer critically increases the thrombotic risk whereas Factor V Leiden is the most common pro-thrombotic mutation. The impact of the factor V Leiden on the risk of VTE in cancer patients remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the impact of factor V Leiden mutation in cancer-associated thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The EDITH hospital-based case-control study enrolled 182 patients with cancer and VTE as well as 182 control patients with cancer, matched for gender, age and cancer location, between 2000 and 2012, in the University Hospital of Brest.

Lumbar spinal stenosis causes cauda equina and nerve root compression, resulting in neurological symptoms. Although trunk flexion during level walking may alleviate these symptoms by enabling spinal canal decompression, some patients do not use this strategy. We aimed to identify the kinetic and kinematic variables that affect trunk flexion in patients during level walking. Gait was recorded in 111 patients using a three-dimensional motion capture system and six force plates. From the data recorded, walking velocity, bilateral step length, cycle time, maximum trunk flexion angle, forward pelvic tilt angle, pelvic rotation angle, maximum and minimum joint angles, and moment and power of the lower limb were calculated. Then a step-wise multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify kinetic and kinematic variables affecting trunk flexion. The maximum hip extension angle (β = 0.416), maximum hip flexion moment (β = -0.348), and step length (β = 0.257) were identified as variables significantly affecting the trunk flexion angle. The coefficient of determination adjusted for the degree of freedom was 0.294 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that patients with lumbar spinal stenosis choose one of two strategies to alleviate symptoms during walking. One strategy is gait with trunk flexion posture to increase step length and hip extension angle. The other strategy is gait with trunk upright posture to decrease step length and hip extension angle.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>739ad8b6</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197228</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915a:93d646dc</id><author><name>Tatsuya Igawa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Igawa, Junji Katsuhira, Akira Hosaka, Kenta Uchikoshi, Shinichi Ishihara, Ko Matsudaira&lt;/p&gt;

Production of higher-fidelity digital elevation models is important; as such models are indispensable components of space data infrastructure. However, loss of terrain features is a constant problem for grid digital elevation models, although these models have already been defined in such a way that their distinct usage as data sources in terrain modeling processing is prohibited. Therefore, in this study, the novel concept-terrain semanteme is proposed to define local space terrain features, and a new process for generating grid digital elevation models based on this new concept is designed. A prototype system is programmed to test the proposed approach; the results indicate that terrain semanteme can be applied in the process of grid digital elevation model generation, and that usage of this new concept improves the digital elevation model fidelity. Moreover, the terrain semanteme technique can be applied for recovery of distorted digital elevation model regions containing terrain semantemes, with good recovery efficiency indicated by experiments.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>78201043</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198530</link><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:668334b:3dd877af</id><author><name>Bo Zhou</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Zhou, Junbo Xu, Xuedong Zhang, Xuejun Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Moreover, the terrain semanteme technique can be applied for recovery of distorted digital elevation model regions containing terrain semantemes, with good recovery efficiency indicated by experiments.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/vkyAcwCU4hU/s41598-018-25748-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>571</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25748-3/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25748_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25748-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25748-3</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25748-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25748-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vkyAcwCU4hU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526281200000</published><fingerprint>d80ff2eb</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25748-3</link><crawled>1526289450172</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1635df0c4bc:2e36446:93d646dc</id><author><name>Yukako Sakaguchi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25748-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25748-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vkyAcwCU4hU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/tdA11XQyhwY/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00275</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Evaluation of Anti-LGR5 Antibodies by ImmunoPET for Imaging Colorectal Tumors and Development of Antibody–Drug Conjugates</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/2018/mpohbp.2018.15.issue-6/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00275/20180529/images/medium/mp-2018-00275e_0006.gif</url><height>254</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>False</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00275</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00275</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00275/20180508/images/medium/mp-2018-00275e_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00275&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase that is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and has been implicated as a driver in a variety of hematological and solid tumors. Currently, there is a complete lack of validated chemical matter for this important drug discovery target. Herein we report on the first fully validated WHSC1 inhibitor, PTD2, a norleucine-containing peptide derived from the histone H4 sequence.

WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase that is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and has been implicated as a driver in a variety of hematological and solid tumors. Currently, there is a complete lack of validated chemical matter for this important drug discovery target. Herein we report on the first fully validated WHSC1 inhibitor, PTD2, a norleucine-containing peptide derived from the histone H4 sequence. This peptide exhibits micromolar affinity towards WHSC1 in biochemical and biophysical assays. Furthermore, a crystal structure was solved with the peptide in complex with SAM and the SET domain of WHSC1L1. This inhibitor is an important first step in creating potent, selective WHSC1 tool compounds for the purposes of understanding the complex biology in relation to human disease.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322305v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>Physiomarkers in Real-Time Physiological Data Streams Predict Adult Sepsis Onset Earlier Than Clinical Practice [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/15/322305</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322305v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Rationale: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality rates and expensive treatment costs. To improve short- and long-term outcomes, it is critical to detect at-risk sepsis patients at an early stage. Objective: Our primary goal was to develop machine learning models capable of predicting sepsis using streaming physiological data in real-time. Methods: A dataset consisting of high-frequency physiological data from 1,161 critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was analyzed in this IRB-approved retrospective observational cohort study. Of that total, 634 patients were identified to have developed sepsis. In this paper, we define sepsis as meeting the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria in the presence of the suspicion of infection. In addition to the physiological data, we include white blood cell count (WBC) to develop a model that can signal the future occurrence of sepsis. A random forest classifier was trained to discriminate between sepsis and non-sepsis patients using a total of 108 features extracted from 2-hour moving time-windows. The models were trained on 80% of the patients and were tested on the remaining 20% of the patients, for two observational periods of lengths 3 and 6 hours. Results: The models, respectively, resulted in F1 scores of 75% and 69% half-hour before sepsis onset and 79% and 76% ten minutes before sepsis onset. On average, the models were able to predict sepsis 210 minutes (3.5 hours) before the onset. Conclusions: The use of robust machine learning algorithms, continuous streams of physiological data, and WBC, allows for early identification of at-risk patients in real-time with high accuracy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526367600000</published><fingerprint>dcf66e2e</fingerprint><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322305v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1526407468561</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16364f99611:3b33262:2835af05</id><author><name>van Wyk, F.</name></author><description>Rationale: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality rates and expensive treatment costs.

Animal paths are analogous to intractable mathematical problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the shortest path problem (SPP). Both the TSP and SPP require an individual to find the shortest path through multiple targets but the TSP demands a return to the start, while the SPP does not. Vervet monkeys are very efficient in solving TSPs but this species is a multiple central place forager that does not always return to the same sleeping site and thus theoretically should be selected to find solutions to SPPs rather than TSPs. We examined path choice by wild vervets in an SPP experimental array where the shortest paths usually differed from those consistent with common heuristic strategies, the nearest-neighbor rule (NNR–go to the closest resource that has not been visited), and the convex hull (put a mental loop around sites, adding inner targets in order of distance from the edge)–an efficient strategy for TSPs but not SPPs. In addition, humans solving SPPs use an initial segment strategy (ISS–choose the straightest path at the beginning, only turning when necessary) and we looked at vervet paths consistent with this strategy. In 615 trials by single foragers, paths usually conformed to the NNR and rarely the slightly more efficient convex hull, supporting that vervets may be selected to solve SPPs. Further, like humans solving SPPs, vervets showed a tendency to use the ISS. Paths consistent with heuristics dropped off sharply, and use of the shortest path increased, when heuristics led to longer paths showing trade-offs in efficiency versus cognitive load. Two individuals out of 17, found the shortest path most often, showing inter-individual variation in path planning. Given support for the NNR and the ISS, we propose a new rule-of-thumb termed the “region heuristic” that vervets may apply in multi-destination routes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>e78bf5f6</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198076</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1c:3dd877af</id><author><name>Julie Annette Teichroeb</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julie Annette Teichroeb, Eve Ann Smeltzer&lt;/p&gt;

Names 2013 (the “Blue Book”) were analyzed by an international team of cheminformatics software
developers. Algorithms for machine implementation were designed, tested, and cross-validated.
Deficiencies in Sequence Rules 1b and 2 were found, and proposed language for their modification
is presented. A concise definition of an additional rule (“Rule 6,” below) is proposed, which
succinctly covers several cases only tangentially mentioned in the 2013 recommendations. Each
rule is discussed from the perspective of machine implementation. The four resultant
implementations are supported by validation suites in 2D and 3D SDF format as well as SMILES.
The validation suites include all significant examples in Chapter 9 of the Blue Book, as well as
several additional structures that highlight more complex aspects of the rules not addressed or not
clearly analyzed in that work. These additional structures support a case for the need for

Names 2013 (the “Blue Book”) were analyzed by an international team of cheminformatics software
developers. Algorithms for machine implementation were designed, tested, and cross-validated.
Deficiencies in Sequence Rules 1b and 2 were found, and proposed language for their modification
is presented. A concise definition of an additional rule (“Rule 6,” below) is proposed, which
succinctly covers several cases only tangentially mentioned in the 2013 recommendations. Each
rule is discussed from the perspective of machine implementation. The four resultant
implementations are supported by validation suites in 2D and 3D SDF format as well as SMILES.
The validation suites include all significant examples in Chapter 9 of the Blue Book, as well as
several additional structures that highlight more complex aspects of the rules not addressed or not
clearly analyzed in that work. These additional structures support a case for the need for
modifications of the Sequence Rules.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/YW43eur48VA/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><title>Death and population dynamics affect mutation rate estimates and evolvability under stress in bacteria</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><recrawled>1527181201615</recrawled><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005056</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005056</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Frenoy, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;
The stress-induced mutagenesis hypothesis postulates that in response to stress, bacteria increase their genome-wide mutation rate, in turn increasing the chances that a descendant is able to better withstand the stress. This has implications for antibiotic treatment: exposure to subinhibitory doses of antibiotics has been reported to increase bacterial mutation rates and thus probably the rate at which resistance mutations appear and lead to treatment failure. More generally, the hypothesis posits that stress increases evolvability (the ability of a population to generate adaptive genetic diversity) and thus accelerates evolution. Measuring mutation rates under stress, however, is problematic, because existing methods assume there is no death. Yet subinhibitory stress levels may induce a substantial death rate. Death events need to be compensated by extra replication to reach a given population size, thus providing more opportunities to acquire mutations. We show that ignoring death leads to a systematic overestimation of mutation rates under stress. We developed a system based on plasmid segregation that allows us to measure death and division rates simultaneously in bacterial populations. Using this system, we found that a substantial death rate occurs at the tested subinhibitory concentrations previously reported to increase mutation rate. Taking this death rate into account lowers and sometimes removes the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, even when antibiotics increase mutation rate, we show that subinhibitory treatments do not increase genetic diversity and evolvability, again because of effects of the antibiotics on population dynamics. We conclude that antibiotic-induced mutagenesis is overestimated because of death and that understanding evolvability under stress requires accounting for the effects of stress on population dynamics as much as on mutation rate. Our goal here is dual: we show that population dynamics and, in particular, the numbers of cell divisions are crucial but neglected parameters in the evolvability of a population, and we provide experimental and computational tools and methods to study evolvability under stress, leading to a reassessment of the magnitude and significance of the stress-induced mutagenesis paradigm.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YW43eur48VA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>61ca3542</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005056</link><crawled>1526060694416</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f5:f3bf0074</id><author><name>Antoine Frenoy</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Frenoy, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;

Target selection is the first and pivotal step in drug discovery. An incorrect choice may not manifest itself for many years after hundreds of millions of research dollars have been spent. We collected a set of 332 targets that succeeded or failed in phase III clinical trials, and explored whether Omic features describing the target genes could predict clinical success. We obtained features from the recently published comprehensive resource: Harmonizome. Nineteen features appeared to be significantly correlated with phase III clinical trial outcomes, but only 4 passed validation schemes that used bootstrapping or modified permutation tests to assess feature robustness and generalizability while accounting for target class selection bias. We also used classifiers to perform multivariate feature selection and found that classifiers with a single feature performed as well in cross-validation as classifiers with more features (AUROC = 0.57 and AUPR = 0.81). The two predominantly selected features were mean mRNA expression across tissues and standard deviation of expression across tissues, where successful targets tended to have lower mean expression and higher expression variance than failed targets. This finding supports the conventional wisdom that it is favorable for a target to be present in the tissue(s) affected by a disease and absent from other tissues. Overall, our results suggest that it is feasible to construct a model integrating interpretable target features to inform target selection. We anticipate deeper insights and better models in the future, as researchers can reuse the data we have provided to improve methods for handling sample biases and learn more informative features.

Aiming at the design of an allosteric modulator of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)–Immunoglobulin G (IgG) interaction, we developed a new methodology including NMR fragment screening, X-ray crystallography, and magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR at 100 kHz after sedimentation, exploiting very fast spinning of the nondeuterated soluble 42 kDa receptor construct to obtain resolved proton-detected 2D and 3D NMR spectra. FcRn plays a crucial role in regulation of IgG and serum albumin catabolism. It is a clinically validated drug target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases caused by pathogenic antibodies via the inhibition of its interaction with IgG. We herein present the discovery of a small molecule that binds into a conserved cavity of the heterodimeric, extracellular domain composed of an α-chain and β2-microglobulin (β2m) (FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt;, 373 residues). X-ray crystallography was used alongside NMR at 100 kHz MAS with sedimented soluble protein to explore possibilities for refining the compound as an allosteric modulator. Proton-detected MAS NMR experiments on fully protonated [&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C,&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]-labeled FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt; yielded ligand-induced chemical-shift perturbations (CSPs) for residues in the binding pocket and allosteric changes close to the interface of the two receptor heterodimers present in the asymmetric unit as well as potentially in the albumin interaction site. X-ray structures with and without ligand suggest the need for an optimized ligand to displace the α-chain with respect to β2m, both of which participate in the FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt;–IgG interaction site. Our investigation establishes a method to characterize structurally small molecule binding to nondeuterated large proteins by NMR, even in their glycosylated form, which may prove highly valuable for structure-based drug discovery campaigns.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S9m_cYKMaok&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>33</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>d28e90d7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006192</link><crawled>1526924854361</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16383d04459:d57e1:d63e3ae2</id><author><name>Daniel Stöppler</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Stöppler, Alex Macpherson, Susanne Smith-Penzel, Nicolas Basse, Fabien Lecomte, Hervé Deboves, Richard D.

Our investigation establishes a method to characterize structurally small molecule binding to nondeuterated large proteins by NMR, even in their glycosylated form, which may prove highly valuable for structure-based drug discovery campaigns.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S9m_cYKMaok&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4483.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Reduction in adaptor amounts establishes degradation hierarchy among protease substrates [Microbiology]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4483</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/19.cover-source.jpg?itok=gY78Iz1p</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4483.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>ATP-dependent proteases control critical cellular processes, including development, physiology, and virulence.

Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a plant trait that involves interactions between nuclear- and mitochondrial genomes. In CMS, the nuclear &lt;i&gt;restorer-of-fertility&lt;/i&gt; gene (&lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;), a suppressor of male-sterility inducing mitochondria, is one of the best known genetic factors. Other unidentified genetic factors may exist but have not been well characterized. In sugar beet (&lt;i&gt;Beta vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; L.), CMS is used for hybrid seed production, but few male-sterility inducing nuclear genotypes exist. Such genotypes could be introduced from a closely related plant such as leaf beet, but first the fertility restoring genotype of the related plant must be characterized. Here, we report the discovery of a Japanese leaf beet accession ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ that has both male-sterility inducing and fertility restoring genotypes. We crossed the leaf beet accession with a sugar beet CMS line, developed succeeding generations, and examined the segregation of two DNA markers that are linked to two sugar beet &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;s, &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt;. Only the &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt; marker co-segregated with fertility restoration in every generation, implying that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus in leaf beet is occupied by a non-restoring allele. Fertility restoration was incomplete without a genetic factor closely linked to &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt;, leading to the assumption that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus encodes a modifier that cannot restore fertility by itself but perhaps strengthens another &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;. We sequenced the apparently non-restoring ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; gene-coding region and found that it closely resembles a restoring allele. The protein product demonstrated its potential to suppress CMS in transgenic suspension cells. In contrast, ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; transcript abundance was highly reduced compared to that of the restoring &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt;. Consistently, changes in protein complexes containing CMS-associated mitochondrial protein in anthers were very minor. Accordingly, we concluded that ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; is a hypomorph that acts as a non-restoring allele but has the potential to support another &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. it is a modifier candidate.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>1bae1ed3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198409</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84551:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Takumi Arakawa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takumi Arakawa, Daisuke Uchiyama, Takashi Ohgami, Ryo Ohgami, Tomoki Murata, Yujiro Honma, Hiroyuki Hamada, Yosuke Kuroda, Kazunori Taguchi, Kazuyoshi Kitazaki, Tomohiko Kubo&lt;/p&gt;

A clinically useful prediction algorithm should be accurate, generalizable, be able to integrate diverse data types, and handle sparse data. A clinical predictor based on genomic data needs to be easily interpretable to drive hypothesis-driven research into new treatments. We describe netDx, a novel supervised patient classification framework based on patient similarity networks. netDx meets the above criteria and particularly excels at data integration and model interpretability. As a machine learning method, netDx demonstrates consistently excellent performance in a cancer survival benchmark across four cancer types by integrating up to six genomic and clinical data types. In these tests, netDx has significantly higher average performance than most other machine-learning approaches across most cancer types and its best model outperforms all other methods for two cancer types. In comparison to traditional machine learning-based patient classifiers, netDx results are more interpretable, visualizing the decision boundary in the context of patient similarity space.

A clinically useful prediction algorithm should be accurate, generalizable, be able to integrate diverse data types, and handle sparse data. A clinical predictor based on genomic data needs to be easily interpretable to drive hypothesis-driven research into new treatments. We describe netDx, a novel supervised patient classification framework based on patient similarity networks. netDx meets the above criteria and particularly excels at data integration and model interpretability. As a machine learning method, netDx demonstrates consistently excellent performance in a cancer survival benchmark across four cancer types by integrating up to six genomic and clinical data types. In these tests, netDx has significantly higher average performance than most other machine-learning approaches across most cancer types and its best model outperforms all other methods for two cancer types. In comparison to traditional machine learning-based patient classifiers, netDx results are more interpretable, visualizing the decision boundary in the context of patient similarity space. When patient similarity is defined by pathway-level gene expression, netDx identifies biological pathways important for outcome prediction, as demonstrated in diverse data sets of breast cancer and asthma. Thus, netDx can serve both as a patient classifier and as a tool for discovery of biological features characteristic of disease. We provide a software complete implementation of netDx along with sample files and automation workflows in R.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328740v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>Rapid alignment-free phylogenetic identification of metagenomic sequences [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/23/328740</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328740v2?rss=1</originId><content><content>Motivation: Taxonomic classification is at the core of environmental DNA analysis.

Background &lt;p&gt;Few studies have investigated the relationship between physical activity (PA) of low intensity and duration with quality of life (QoL) among individuals at risk or with cardiovascular disease (CVD).&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To investigate whether PA of different intensity and duration moderates the relationship between CVD and its risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia) and QoL in adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Population-based cross-sectional studies using data from the EpiFloripa Cohort Study (Southern Brazil; n = 1,220, 38.8±12.0 years, 48.2% males) and the North West Adelaide Health Study (NWAHS, South Australia; n = 1,661, 43.7±11.1 years, 49.7% males). The physical and psychological domains of QoL were assessed using the WHOQOL-Bref (EpiFloripa) or the SF-36 (NWAHS) questionnaires. The diagnosis of CVD and its risk factors were self-reported. PA was self-reported and quantified by its intensity [“walking” or moderate/vigorous (MVPA)] and duration (none, 1–150, ≥150 min/week). Both studies were analysed separately, and results were adjusted for sociodemographic variables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Participants at risk or with CVD from both studies showed a lower QoL than ‘healthy’ individuals with a stronger relationship for the physical domain. PA duration showed a direct-trend relationship with QoL, but the associations were stronger for MVPA in both studies. However, when stratified by health status, the magnitude of the association between “walking” duration and a higher physical QoL was greater among those at risk or with CVD compared to ‘healthy’ individuals. Conversely, among Australians with CVD, MVPA was associated with a better physical QoL only when its duration was ≥150 min/week. All associations were stronger in the NWAHS than in the Brazilian study.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;“Walking” was more prevalent than MVPA and was consistently associated with a better physical QoL among those at risk or with CVD. These findings should be considered in the design of public health interventions designed to increase PA and improve QoL.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>4f36a235</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198769</link><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:6683360:3dd877af</id><author><name>Viviane de Menezes Caceres</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viviane de Menezes Caceres, Nigel Stocks, Robert Adams, Dandara Gabriela Haag, Karen Glazer Peres, Marco Aurélio Peres, David Alejandro González-Chica&lt;/p&gt;

A one-dimensional model, a four-dimensional model reflecting the subscale structure suggested by [1], and a four-dimensional model with the background variables gender and age were applied.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;While the one-dimensional model showed relatively good fit, the four-dimensional model fitted much better. EAP reliability indices were generally satisfying and the latent correlations varied between 0.31 and 0.88. In the analysis involving background variables, we found a limited effect of the participants’ gender. DIF effects were found unveiling some peculiarities. The two-items subscale Interpersonal Difficulties showed severe weaknesses and the Positive Affect subscale with the reversed item wordings also showed unexpected results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While a one-dimensional over-all score might still contain helpful information, the differentiation according to the latent dimension is strongly preferable.

Background &lt;p&gt;Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), particularly pathologic complete response (pCR), is an independent predictor of favorable clinical outcome in breast cancer (BC). The accuracy of residual disease measurement and reporting is of critical importance in treatment planning and prognosis for these patients. Currently, gross pathological evaluation of the residual tumor bed is the greatest determinant for accurate reporting of NACT response. Fluorescence imaging (FI) is a new technology that is being evaluated for use in the detection of tumors in different oncological conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate whether indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) is able to detect residual breast tumor tissue after NACT in breast surgical operative specimens.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients who underwent NACT for BC and were admitted for breast surgery were selected for participation in this study. Free ICG (0.25 mg/kg) was injected intraoperatively. Tumor-to-background fluorescence ratio (TBFR) was calculated on ex vivo samples from the surgical specimen.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and seventy-two samples from nine breast surgical specimens were evaluated for their fluorescence intensity. Among them, 52 were malignant (30.2%) and 120 were benign (69.8%). The mean TBFR was 3.3 (SD 1.68) in malignant samples and 1.9 (SD 0.97) in benign samples (p = 0.0002). With a TBFR cut-off value of 1.3, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, false negative rate, and false positive rate of ICG-FI to predict residual tumoral disease in breast surgical samples post-NACT were 94.2%, 31.7%, 92.7%, 5.8%, and 68.3%, respectively.

Background &lt;p&gt;Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), particularly pathologic complete response (pCR), is an independent predictor of favorable clinical outcome in breast cancer (BC). The accuracy of residual disease measurement and reporting is of critical importance in treatment planning and prognosis for these patients. Currently, gross pathological evaluation of the residual tumor bed is the greatest determinant for accurate reporting of NACT response. Fluorescence imaging (FI) is a new technology that is being evaluated for use in the detection of tumors in different oncological conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate whether indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) is able to detect residual breast tumor tissue after NACT in breast surgical operative specimens.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients who underwent NACT for BC and were admitted for breast surgery were selected for participation in this study. Free ICG (0.25 mg/kg) was injected intraoperatively. Tumor-to-background fluorescence ratio (TBFR) was calculated on ex vivo samples from the surgical specimen.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and seventy-two samples from nine breast surgical specimens were evaluated for their fluorescence intensity. Among them, 52 were malignant (30.2%) and 120 were benign (69.8%). The mean TBFR was 3.3 (SD 1.68) in malignant samples and 1.9 (SD 0.97) in benign samples (p = 0.0002). With a TBFR cut-off value of 1.3, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, false negative rate, and false positive rate of ICG-FI to predict residual tumoral disease in breast surgical samples post-NACT were 94.2%, 31.7%, 92.7%, 5.8%, and 68.3%, respectively.

As global political preeminence gradually shifted from the United Kingdom to the United States, so did the capacity to culturally influence the rest of the world. In this work, we analyze how the world-wide varieties of written English are evolving. We study both the spatial and temporal variations of vocabulary and spelling of English using a large corpus of geolocated tweets and the Google Books datasets corresponding to books published in the US and the UK. The advantage of our approach is that we can address both standard written language (Google Books) and the more colloquial forms of microblogging messages (Twitter). We find that American English is the dominant form of English outside the UK and that its influence is felt even within the UK borders. Finally, we analyze how this trend has evolved over time and the impact that some cultural events have had in shaping it.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>c02dde8d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197741</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd72:3dd877af</id><author><name>Bruno Gonçalves</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Gonçalves, Lucía Loureiro-Porto, José J.

High economic burden is associated with foodborne illnesses. Different disinfection methods are therefore employed in food processing industry; such as use of ultraviolet light or usage of surfaces with copper-containing alloys. However, all the disinfection methods currently in use have some shortcomings. In this work we show that copper doped TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotubes deposited on existing surfaces and illuminated with ceiling mounted fluorescent lights can retard the growth of &lt;i&gt;Listeria Innocua&lt;/i&gt; by 80% in seven hours of exposure to the fluorescent lights at different places in a food processing plant or in the laboratory conditions with daily reinocuation and washing. The disinfection properties of the surfaces seem to depend mainly on the temperature difference of the surface and the dew point, where for the maximum effectiveness the difference should be about 3 degrees celsius. The TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotubes have a potential to be employed for an economical and continuous disinfection of surfaces.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>2608f9af</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197308</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b1:2835af05</id><author><name>Tilen Koklic</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tilen Koklic, Štefan Pintarič, Irena Zdovc, Majda Golob, Polona Umek, Alma Mehle, Martin Dobeic, Janez Štrancar&lt;/p&gt;

However, all the disinfection methods currently in use have some shortcomings. In this work we show that copper doped TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotubes deposited on existing surfaces and illuminated with ceiling mounted fluorescent lights can retard the growth of &lt;i&gt;Listeria Innocua&lt;/i&gt; by 80% in seven hours of exposure to the fluorescent lights at different places in a food processing plant or in the laboratory conditions with daily reinocuation and washing. The disinfection properties of the surfaces seem to depend mainly on the temperature difference of the surface and the dew point, where for the maximum effectiveness the difference should be about 3 degrees celsius. The TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotubes have a potential to be employed for an economical and continuous disinfection of surfaces.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/316265v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>Bayesian Estimation of 3D Chromosomal Structure from Single Cell Hi-C Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/07/316265</canonicalUrl><unread>False</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/316265v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>The problem of 3D chromosome structure inference from Hi-C datasets is important and challenging.

&lt;i&gt;Grapevine Pinot gris virus&lt;/i&gt; (GPGV) is a widely distributed grapevine pathogen that has been associated to the grapevine leaf mottling and deformation disease. With the aim of better understanding the disease epidemiology and providing efficient control strategies a specific and quantitative duplex TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay has been developed. This method has allowed reliable quantitation of the GPGV titer ranging from 30 up to 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; transcript copies, with a detection limit of 70 viral copies in plant material. The assay targets a grapevine internal control that reduces the occurrence of false negative results, thus increasing the diagnostic sensitivity of the technique. Viral isolates both associated and non-associated to symptoms from Greece, Slovakia and Spain have been successfully detected. The method has also been applied to the absolute quantitation of GPGV in its putative transmission vector &lt;i&gt;Colomerus vitis&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the viral titer present in single mites has been determined. In addition, in the current study a new polymorphism in the GPGV genome responsible for a shorter movement protein has been found. A phylogenetic study based on this genomic region has shown a high variability among Spanish isolates and points to a different evolutionary origin of this new polymorphism. The methodology here developed opens new possibilities for basic and epidemiological studies as well as for the establishment of efficient control strategies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>90d694f2</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197237</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b79:93d646dc</id><author><name>Félix Morán</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Félix Morán, Antonio Olmos, Leonidas Lotos, Lukáš Predajňa, Nikolaos Katis, Miroslav Glasa, Varvara Maliogka, Ana B.

Aim &lt;p&gt;To assess the effects of differential exposure to antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) on short- and long-term outcomes of infants born before 24 weeks of gestation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective cohort study of 147 infants delivered by 116 women at 21–23 weeks of gestation between January 2001 and December 2016 at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, Korea. Eligible subjects were categorized into the following three groups according to ACS exposure: non-user (n = 53), partial-course (n = 44), and complete-course (n = 50). Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to compare neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidities including intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and neurodevelopmental impairment including cerebral palsy among the three groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Neonatal mortality rate was significantly lower in the ACS-user groups (non-user, 52.8%; partial-course, 27.3%; complete-course, 28.0%; P = 0.01), but complete-course of ACS therapy had no advantages over partial-course. A lower incidence of IVH was observed in the complete-course group (non-users, 54.8%; partial-course, 48.6%; complete-course, 20.5%; P = 0.003). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ACS therapy, either partial- or complete-course, was associated with a lower rate of neonatal mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.375; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.141–0.996 in partial-course; aOR 0.173; 95% CI 0.052–0.574) in complete-course). IVH (aOR 0.191; 95% CI 0.071–0.516) was less likely to occur in the complete-course group than in the non-user group. Neurodevelopmental impairment of survivors at 18–22 month after birth was not significantly different among the three groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ACS therapy in preterm births at 21–23 weeks of gestation was associated with significantly reduced rates of neonatal mortality and IVH, especially with complete administration.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>bdef5e89</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198471</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b78d:3dd877af</id><author><name>Seon-Mi Kim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seon-Mi Kim, Ji-Hee Sung, Jin-Yi Kuk, Hyun-Hwa Cha, Suk-Joo Choi, Soo-young Oh, Cheong-Rae Roh&lt;/p&gt;

In preparation for dramatic morphogenetic events of gastrulation, rapid embryonic cell cycles slow at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; embryos, down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity initiates this slowing by delaying replication of heterochromatic satellite sequences and extending S phase. We found that Cdk1 activity inhibited the chromatin association of Rap1 interacting factor 1 (Rif1), a candidate repressor of replication. Furthermore, Rif1 bound selectively to satellite sequences following Cdk1 down-regulation at the MBT. In the next S phase, Rif1 dissociated from different satellites in an orderly schedule that anticipated their replication. Rif1 lacking potential phosphorylation sites failed to dissociate and dominantly prevented completion of replication. Loss of Rif1 in mutant embryos shortened the post-MBT S phase and rescued embryonic cell cycles disrupted by depletion of the S phase–promoting kinase, cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7). Our work shows that Rif1 and S phase kinases compose a replication timer controlling first the developmental onset of late replication and then the precise schedule of replication within S phase.

In preparation for dramatic morphogenetic events of gastrulation, rapid embryonic cell cycles slow at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; embryos, down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity initiates this slowing by delaying replication of heterochromatic satellite sequences and extending S phase. We found that Cdk1 activity inhibited the chromatin association of Rap1 interacting factor 1 (Rif1), a candidate repressor of replication. Furthermore, Rif1 bound selectively to satellite sequences following Cdk1 down-regulation at the MBT. In the next S phase, Rif1 dissociated from different satellites in an orderly schedule that anticipated their replication. Rif1 lacking potential phosphorylation sites failed to dissociate and dominantly prevented completion of replication. Loss of Rif1 in mutant embryos shortened the post-MBT S phase and rescued embryonic cell cycles disrupted by depletion of the S phase–promoting kinase, cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7). Our work shows that Rif1 and S phase kinases compose a replication timer controlling first the developmental onset of late replication and then the precise schedule of replication within S phase. In addition, we describe how onset of late replication fits into the progressive maturation of heterochromatin during development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ajE-XA15ViE&quot;

Background &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the associations of handgrip strength and cognitive function in cancer survivors ≥ 60 years old using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data in two waves of NHANES (2011–2014) were aggregated. Handgrip strength in kilogram (kg) was defined as the maximum value achieved using either hand. Two cognitive function tests were conducted among adults 60 years and older. The Animal Fluency Test (AFT) examines categorical verbal fluency (a component of executive function), and the Digital Symbol Substitution test (DSST) assesses processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory. Survey analysis procedures were used to account for the complex sampling design of the NHANES. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate associations of handgrip strength with cognitive test scores, adjusting for confounders (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking status, depressive symptoms and leisure time physical activity).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 383 cancer survivors (58.5% women, mean age = 70.9 years, mean BMI = 29.3 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), prevalent cancer types were breast (22.9%), prostate (16.4%), colon (6.9%) and cervix (6.2%). In women, each increase in kg of handgrip strength was associated with 0.20 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.33) higher score on AFT and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.30 to 1.35) higher score on DSST. In men, we observed an inverted U-shape association where cognitive function peaked at handgrip strength of 40–42 kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Handgrip strength, a modifiable factor, appears to be associated with aspects of cognitive functions in cancer survivors.

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>46fbfa4e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914c:93d646dc</id><author><name>Christi Patten</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christi Patten, James Levine, Ioannis Pavlidis, Joyce Balls-Berry, Arya Shah, Christine Hughes, Tabetha Brockman, Miguel Valdez Soto, Daniel Witt, Gabriel Koepp, Pamela Sinicrope, Jamie Richards&lt;/p&gt;

The present study investigated the interplay between selective inhibition (the ability to suppress specific competing responses) and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any inappropriate response) during single word production. To this end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task. Selective inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to name target pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words. Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250 ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures with semantically related distractors than with unrelated distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a common inhibitory mechanism during different stages of the speech production process.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>619de92</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</link><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ea:2835af05</id><author><name>Ruben D.

These findings identify a novel glia-to-glia signaling pathway that promotes myelin formation and repair, and suggest new strategies to enhance remyelination.</description><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33385</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/F03pUKPq7tQ/s41467-018-03718-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Stepwise heating in Stille polycondensation toward no batch-to-batch variations in polymer solar cell performance</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03718-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03718-7</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stepwise heating in Stille polycondensation toward no batch-to-batch variations in polymer solar cell performance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stepwise heating in Stille polycondensation toward no batch-to-batch variations in polymer solar cell performance, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03718-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03718-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Polymer electronics may have a bright future but the poor reproducibility limits the scaled-up manufacturing.

In precision medicine, especially in clinical genetics, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) as well as disease ontologies like the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) or Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are often used for deep phenotyping of patients and coding of clinical diagnoses.

We expect this approach to decrease the additional workload to a minimum while ensuring high quality associations with ontology classes. Standardised collection of phenotypic information at the time of describing the patient allows for streamlining of clinic workflow, efficient data entry, and will subsequently promote clinical and molecular diagnosis, remove ambiguousness from manuscripts, and allow sharing of anonymised patient phenotype data with ultimate goal of a better understanding of the disease.

Four main motivations for continuing ART emerged: 1) evidence that ART improved their own and their children’s health; 2) strong desire to be healthy and keep their children healthy; 3) treatment was socially supported; 4) HIV/ART counselling effectively showed benefits of ART and told women what to expect.

However, the actual state of the body of bioinformatics software remains largely unknown. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the state of source code in the bioinformatics community, specifically looking at relationships between code properties, development activity, developer communities, and software impact. To investigate these issues, we curated a list of 1,720 bioinformatics repositories on GitHub through their mention in peer-reviewed bioinformatics articles. Additionally, we included 23 high-profile repositories identified by their popularity in an online bioinformatics forum. We analyzed repository metadata, source code, development activity, and team dynamics using data made available publicly through the GitHub API, as well as article metadata. We found key relationships within our dataset, including: certain scientific topics are associated with more active code development and higher community interest in the repository; most of the code in the main dataset is written in dynamically typed languages, while most of the code in the high-profile set is statically typed; developer team size is associated with community engagement and high-profile repositories have larger teams; the proportion of female contributors decreases for high-profile repositories and with seniority level in author lists; and, multiple measures of project impact are associated with the simple variable of whether the code was modified at all after paper publication.

However, the actual state of the body of bioinformatics software remains largely unknown. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the state of source code in the bioinformatics community, specifically looking at relationships between code properties, development activity, developer communities, and software impact. To investigate these issues, we curated a list of 1,720 bioinformatics repositories on GitHub through their mention in peer-reviewed bioinformatics articles. Additionally, we included 23 high-profile repositories identified by their popularity in an online bioinformatics forum. We analyzed repository metadata, source code, development activity, and team dynamics using data made available publicly through the GitHub API, as well as article metadata. We found key relationships within our dataset, including: certain scientific topics are associated with more active code development and higher community interest in the repository; most of the code in the main dataset is written in dynamically typed languages, while most of the code in the high-profile set is statically typed; developer team size is associated with community engagement and high-profile repositories have larger teams; the proportion of female contributors decreases for high-profile repositories and with seniority level in author lists; and, multiple measures of project impact are associated with the simple variable of whether the code was modified at all after paper publication. In addition to providing the first large-scale analysis of bioinformatics code to our knowledge, our work will enable future analysis through publicly available data, code, and methods.

Impairment in work function is a frequent outcome in patients with chronic conditions such as immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), depression and anxiety disorders. The personal and economic costs of work impairment in these disorders are immense. Symptoms of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety are potentially remediable forms of distress that may contribute to work impairment in chronic health conditions such as IMID. The present study evaluated the association between pain [Medical Outcomes Study Pain Effects Scale], fatigue [Daily Fatigue Impact Scale], depression and anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale] and work impairment [Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Scale] in four patient populations: multiple sclerosis (n = 255), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 248, rheumatoid arthritis (n = 154) and a depression and anxiety group (n = 307), using quantile regression, controlling for the effects of sociodemographic factors, physical disability, and cognitive deficits. Each of pain, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and fatigue individually showed significant associations with work absenteeism, presenteeism, and general activity impairment (quantile regression standardized estimates ranging from 0.3 to 1.0). When the distress variables were entered concurrently into the regression models, fatigue was a significant predictor of work and activity impairment in all models (quantile regression standardized estimates ranging from 0.2 to 0.5). These findings have important clinical implications for understanding the determinants of work impairment and for improving work-related outcomes in chronic disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>70e435b1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198975</link><crawled>1528394402297</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db67c9f9:679b323:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Murray W.

However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change, favorably or unfavorably, if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is often limited because these complex relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality and morbidity. Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal networks. Unlike approaches limited to predicting simple drug-drug interaction values, Decagon can predict the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well polypharmacy side effects that have a strong molecular basis, while on predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon opens up opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient population data to flag and prioritize polypharmacy side effects for follow-up analysis via formal pharmacological studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526626800000</published><fingerprint>c5ee0d2d</fingerprint><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/258814v2?rss=1</link><crawled>1526665534065</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163745b5a71:521e72b:3dd877af</id><author><name>Zitnik, M.</name></author><description>The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common to treat patients with complex diseases or co-existing conditions.

Unlike approaches limited to predicting simple drug-drug interaction values, Decagon can predict the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well polypharmacy side effects that have a strong molecular basis, while on predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon opens up opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient population data to flag and prioritize polypharmacy side effects for follow-up analysis via formal pharmacological studies.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/E5353.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>T7 phage factor required for managing RpoS in Escherichia coli [Microbiology]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/E5353</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/E5353.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>T7 development in Escherichia coli requires the inhibition of the housekeeping form of the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP), Eσ70, by two T7 proteins: Gp2 and Gp5.7.

The understanding of acclimation strategies to low temperature and water availability is decisive to ensure coffee crop sustainability, since these environmental conditions determine the suitability of cultivation areas. In this context, the impacts of single and combined exposure to drought and cold were evaluated in three genotypes of the two major cropped species, &lt;i&gt;Coffea arabica&lt;/i&gt; cv. Icatu, &lt;i&gt;Coffea canephora&lt;/i&gt; cv. Apoatã, and the hybrid Obatã. Crucial traits of plant resilience to environmental stresses have been examined: photosynthesis, lipoperoxidation and the antioxidant response. Drought and/or cold promoted leaf dehydration, which was accompanied by stomatal and mesophyll limitations that impaired leaf C-assimilation in all genotypes. However, Icatu showed a lower impact upon stress exposure and a faster and complete photosynthetic recovery. Although lipoperoxidation was increased by drought (Icatu) and cold (all genotypes), it was greatly reduced by stress interaction, especially in Icatu. In fact, although the antioxidative system was reinforced under single drought and cold exposure (e.g., activity of enzymes as Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, APX, glutathione reductase and catalase, CAT), the stronger increases were observed upon the simultaneous exposure to both stresses, which was accompanied with a transcriptional response of some genes, namely related to APX. Complementary, non-enzyme antioxidant molecules were promoted mostly by cold and the stress interaction, including α-tocopherol (in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;arabica&lt;/i&gt; plants), ascorbate (ASC), zeaxanthin, and phenolic compounds (all genotypes). In general, drought promoted antioxidant enzymes activity, whereas cold enhanced the synthesis of both enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidants, the latter likely related to a higher need of antioxidative capability when enzyme reactions were probably quite repressed by low temperature. Icatu showed the wider antioxidative capability, with the triggering of all studied antioxidative molecules by drought (except CAT), cold, and, particularly, stress interaction (except ASC), revealing a clear stress cross-tolerance. This justified the lower impacts on membrane lipoperoxidation and photosynthetic capacity under stress interaction conditions, related to a better ROS control. These findings are also relevant to coffee water management, showing that watering in the cold season should be largely avoided.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>458174e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198694</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd7:3dd877af</id><author><name>José C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is now operationally defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an infection, identified by an acute change in SOFA-Score of at least two points, including clinical chemistry such as creatinine or bilirubin concentrations. However, little knowledge exists about organ-specific microRNAs as potentially new biomarkers. Accordingly, we tested the hypotheses that micro-RNA-122, the foremost liver-related micro-RNA (miR), 1) discriminates between sepsis and infection, 2) is an early predictor for mortality, and 3) improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-score.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed 108 patients with sepsis (infection + increase SOFA-Score ≥2) within the first 24h of ICU admission and as controls 20 patients with infections without sepsis (infection + SOFA-Score ≤1). Total circulating miR was isolated from serum and relative miR-122 expression was measured (using spiked-in cel-miR-54) and associated with 30-day survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;30-day survival of the sepsis patients was 63%. miR-122 expression was 40-fold higher in non-survivors (p = 0.001) and increased almost 6-fold in survivors (p = 0.013) compared to controls. miR-122 serum-expression discriminated both between sepsis vs. infection (AUC 0.760, sensitivity 58.3%, specificity 95%) and survivors vs. non-survivors (AUC 0.728, sensitivity 42.5%, specificity 94%). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed miR-122 (HR 4.3; 95%-CI 2.0–8.9, p&amp;lt;0.001) as independent prognostic factor for 30-day mortality. Furthermore, the predictive value for 30-day mortality of the SOFA-Score (AUC 0.668) was improved by adding miR-122 (AUC 0.743; net reclassification improvement 0.37, p&amp;lt;0.001; integrated discrimination improvement 0.07, p = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Increased miR-122 serum concentration supports the discrimination between infection and sepsis, is an early and independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, and improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-Score, suggesting a potential role for miR-122 in sepsis-related prediction models.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>a80077c4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197637</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761235:93d646dc</id><author><name>Tim Rahmel</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tim Rahmel, Simon T.

A novel α-galactosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 36 was cloned from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus coagulans&lt;/i&gt;, overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and characterized. The purified enzyme Aga-BC7050 was 85 kDa according to SDS-PAGE and 168 kDa according to gel filtration, indicating that its native structure is a dimer. With &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl-α-d- galactopyranoside (pNPGal) as the substrate, optimal temperature and pH were 55 °C and 6.0, respectively. At 60 °C for 30 min, it retained &gt; 50% of its activity. It was stable at pH 5.0–10.0, and showed remarkable resistance to proteinase K, subtilisin A, α-chymotrypsin, and trypsin. Its activity was not inhibited by glucose, sucrose, xylose, or fructose, but was slightly inhibited at galactose concentrations up to 100 mM. Aga-BC7050 was highly active toward pNPGal, melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. It completely hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose in &amp;lt; 30 min. These characteristics suggest that Aga-BC7050 could be used in feed and food industries and sugar processing.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>5a4167a5</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197067</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475068:2835af05</id><author><name>Ruili Zhao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ruili Zhao, Rui Zhao, Yishuai Tu, Xiaoming Zhang, Liping Deng, Xiangdong Chen&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper we report an initial validation of the Shape Trail Test–Child Version (STT-CV) with a non-clinical sample of children aged 6 to 9 years. The STT-CV has been developed as an age-appropriate and culturally fair direct downward extension of the Trail Making Test (TMT) for the assessment of cognitive flexibility. Children completed the STT-CV and four established measures of executive functions that assessed working memory, inhibitory control and task switching. Results showed the expected age-based differences in completion times for both parts of the STT-CV (Trail A and Trail B). Children’s performance on the STT-CV correlated significantly with all four measures of executive functions. After controlling for the effects of chronological age, completion times for Trail B remained correlated with most other measures of executive functions. These findings provide emerging evidence for the utility of the STT-CV, and highlight the need for designing and using appropriate variants of the TMT in the behavioural assessment of cognitive flexibility in developmentally and culturally diverse populations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>7b4121fe</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198254</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b94a:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Amy Y.

The development of high-yielding crops with drought tolerance is necessary to increase food, feed, fiber and fuel production. Methods that create similar environmental conditions for a large number of genotypes are essential to investigate plant responses to drought in gene discovery studies. Modern facilities that control water availability for each plant remain cost-prohibited to some sections of the research community. We present an alternative cost-effective automated irrigation system scalable for a high-throughput and controlled dry-down treatment of plants. This system was tested in sorghum using two experiments. First, four genotypes were subjected to ten days of dry-down to achieve three final Volumetric Water Content (VWC) levels: drought (0.10 and 0.20 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;) and control (0.30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;).

The development of high-yielding crops with drought tolerance is necessary to increase food, feed, fiber and fuel production. Methods that create similar environmental conditions for a large number of genotypes are essential to investigate plant responses to drought in gene discovery studies. Modern facilities that control water availability for each plant remain cost-prohibited to some sections of the research community. We present an alternative cost-effective automated irrigation system scalable for a high-throughput and controlled dry-down treatment of plants. This system was tested in sorghum using two experiments. First, four genotypes were subjected to ten days of dry-down to achieve three final Volumetric Water Content (VWC) levels: drought (0.10 and 0.20 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;) and control (0.30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;). The final average VWC was 0.11, 0.22, and 0.31 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and significant differences in biomass accumulation were observed between control and drought treatments. Second, 42 diverse sorghum genotypes were subjected to a seven-day dry-down treatment for a final drought stress of 0.15 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; VWC. The final average VWC was 0.17 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, and plants presented significant differences in photosynthetic rate during the drought period. These results demonstrate that cost-effective automation systems can successfully control substrate water content for each plant, to accurately compare their phenotypic responses to drought, and be scaled up for high-throughput phenotyping studies.</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Human Biology and Medicine</item><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><title>A homozygous loss-of-function CAMK2A mutation causes growth delay, frequent seizures and severe intellectual disability</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32451</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32451</originId><summary><content>Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) plays fundamental roles in synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory.

Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß.

Together, this defines an ordered sarcomere morphogenesis process under precise transcriptional control - a concept that may also apply to vertebrate muscle or heart development.</description><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34058</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/Jf_7QJuQn7s/acs.jmedchem.8b00173</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Factor XIa Inhibitors as New Anticoagulants</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00173</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00173</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00173/20180518/images/medium/jm-2018-00173h_0035.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00173&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Invasions of Ponto-Caspian fish species into north-western European river basins accelerated since the opening of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal in 1992. Since 2002, at least five Ponto-Caspian alien fish species have arrived in The Netherlands. Four species belong to the Gobiidae family (&lt;i&gt;Neogobius fluviatilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neogobius melanostomus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ponticola kessleri&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Proterorhinus semilunaris&lt;/i&gt;) and one to the Cyprinidae family (&lt;i&gt;Romanogobio belingi&lt;/i&gt;). These species are expected to be potentially deleterious for the populations of four native benthic fish species: &lt;i&gt;Gobio gobio&lt;/i&gt; (Cyprinidae), &lt;i&gt;Barbatula barbatula&lt;/i&gt; (Nemacheilidae), &lt;i&gt;Cottus perifretum&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rhenanus&lt;/i&gt; (Cottidae). Invasion success may be dependent on competitive trophic interactions with native species, which are enabled and/or constrained by feeding-related morphological traits. Twenty-two functional feeding traits were measured in nine species (in total 90 specimens). These traits were quantitatively linked to the mechanical, chemical and behavioral properties of a range of aquatic resource categories, using a previously developed food-fish model (FFM). The FFM was used to predict the trophic profile (TP) of each fish: the combined capacities to feed on each of the resource types. The most extreme TPs belonged to three alien species, indicating that they were most specialized among the studied species. Of these three, only &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kessleri&lt;/i&gt; overlapped with the two native &lt;i&gt;Cottus&lt;/i&gt; species, indicating potential trophic competition. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fluviatilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;belingi&lt;/i&gt; did not show any overlap, indicating that there is low trophic competition. The two remaining alien goby species (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;melanostomus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;semilunaris&lt;/i&gt;) had average TPs and could be considered generalist feeders. They overlapped with each other and with &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gobio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbatula&lt;/i&gt;, indicating potential trophic competition. This study suggests that both generalist and specialist species can be successful invaders. Since the FFM predicts potential interactions between species, it provides a tool to support horizon scanning and rapid risk assessments of alien species.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>2</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>e4068387</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197636</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f42:2835af05</id><author><name>Leopold A.

Avian embryos are among the most convenient and the primary representatives for the study of classical embryology. It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2°C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>118f9c95</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196973</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed8:2835af05</id><author><name>Chompunut Lumsangkul</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chompunut Lumsangkul, Yang-Kwang Fan, Shen-Chang Chang, Jyh-Cherng Ju, Hsin-I.

To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><title>Dual tRNA mimicry in the Cricket Paralysis Virus IRES uncovers an unexpected similarity with the Hepatitis C Virus IRES</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34062</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34062</originId><summary><content>Co-opting the cellular machinery for protein production is a compulsory requirement for viruses.

Q fever vaccine uptake among veterinary nurses in Australia is low, suggesting veterinarians are not recommending the vaccination to veterinary personnel. This study aimed to determine the willingness of veterinarians to recommend Q fever vaccination to veterinary personnel and to identify factors influencing Q fever vaccine uptake by veterinary nurses in Australia. An online cross sectional survey targeted veterinarians and veterinary nurses in Australia in 2014. Responses were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Factors significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with a willingness to recommend the vaccination, expressed by 35% (95% CI 31–38%) of veterinarians (n = 828), were (1) being very concerned for colleagues regarding &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; (OR 4.73), (2) disagreeing the vaccine is harmful (OR 3.80), (3) high Q fever knowledge (OR 2.27), (4) working within small animal practice (OR 1.67), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.55), and (6) age, with veterinarians under 39 years most likely to recommend vaccination. Of the veterinary nursing cohort who reported a known Q fever vaccination status (n = 688), 29% (95% CI 26–33%) had sought vaccination. This was significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with (1) agreeing the vaccine is important (OR 8.34), (2) moderate/high Q fever knowledge (OR 5.51), (3) working in Queensland (OR 4.00), (4) working within livestock/mixed animal practice (OR 3.24), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.86), (6) strong reliance on work culture for biosecurity information (OR 2.5), (7) perceiving personal exposure to &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; to be at least low/moderate (OR 2.14), and (8) both agreeing the vaccine is safe and working within a corporate practice structure (OR 4.28). The study identified the need for veterinarians to take greater responsibility for workplace health and safety promotion, and calls for better education of veterinary personnel to raise awareness of the potential for occupational exposure to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burnetii&lt;/i&gt; and improve the perception of the Q fever vaccine as being important, safe and cost-effective.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>12</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>b3dfd44a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198421</link><crawled>1527876013672</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf3:3dd877af</id><author><name>Emily Sellens</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emily Sellens, Jacqueline M.

Kidney immune cells play important roles in pathogenesis of many diseases, including ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and transplant rejection. While studying murine kidney T cells, we serendipitously identified a kidney mononuclear phagocytic cell (MPC) subset characterized by intermediate surface expression of CD45 and CD11b. These CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; MPCs were further identified as F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cells, comprising ~17% of total CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in normal mouse kidney (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and virtually absent from all other organs examined except the heart. Systemic clodronate treatment had more significant depletive effect on the CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; population (77.3%±5.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) than on CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population (14.8%±16.6%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.49). In addition, CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; MPCs had higher phagocytic function in the normal kidney (35.6%±3.3% vs. 24.1%±2.2%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04), but lower phagocytic capacity in post-ischemic kidney (54.9%±1.0% vs. 67.8%±1.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) compared to the CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population. Moreover, the CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; population had higher intracellular production of the pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (58.4%±5.2% vs. 27.3%±0.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and lower production of the anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10 (7.2%±1.3% vs. 14.9%±2.2%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) following kidney IRI, suggesting a functional role under inflammatory conditions. The CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; cells increased early after IRI, and then abruptly decreased 48h later, whereas CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells steadily increased after IRI before declining at 72h (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). We also identified the CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; MPC subtype in human kidney. We conclude that CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;population represent a unique subset of MPCs found in both mouse and human kidneys.

These CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; MPCs were further identified as F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cells, comprising ~17% of total CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in normal mouse kidney (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and virtually absent from all other organs examined except the heart. Systemic clodronate treatment had more significant depletive effect on the CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; population (77.3%±5.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) than on CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population (14.8%±16.6%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.49). In addition, CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; MPCs had higher phagocytic function in the normal kidney (35.6%±3.3% vs. 24.1%±2.2%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04), but lower phagocytic capacity in post-ischemic kidney (54.9%±1.0% vs. 67.8%±1.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) compared to the CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population. Moreover, the CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; population had higher intracellular production of the pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (58.4%±5.2% vs. 27.3%±0.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and lower production of the anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10 (7.2%±1.3% vs. 14.9%±2.2%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) following kidney IRI, suggesting a functional role under inflammatory conditions. The CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; cells increased early after IRI, and then abruptly decreased 48h later, whereas CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells steadily increased after IRI before declining at 72h (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). We also identified the CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; MPC subtype in human kidney. We conclude that CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;population represent a unique subset of MPCs found in both mouse and human kidneys. Future studies will further characterize their role in kidney health and disease.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259515v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>GITAR: an Open Source Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Hi-C Data [CONFIRMATORY RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/08/259515</canonicalUrl><unread>False</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259515v2?rss=1</originId><content><content>Interactions between chromatin segments play a large role in functional genomic assays and developments in genomic interaction detection methods have shown interacting topological domains within the genome.

Limited information is available on influenza virus sequence drift between transmission events. In countries with high HIV burdens, like South Africa, the direct and indirect effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events may be of public health concern. To this end, we measured hemagglutinin sequence diversity between influenza transmission events using data and specimens from a study investigating household transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza viruses in 2 peri-urban communities in South Africa during the 2013 influenza season. Thirty index cases and 107 of 110 eligible household contacts were enrolled into the study, 47% (14/30) demonstrating intra-household laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission. In this study 35 partial hemagglutinin gene sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing from 11 index cases (sampled at enrolment only) and 16 secondary cases (8 cases sampled at 1 and 8 cases sampled at 2 time-points). Viral sequence identities confirmed matched influenza transmission pairs within the 11 households with corresponding sequenced index and secondary cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 10 different influenza viral lineages in the 14 households. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains were shown to be genetically distinct between the 2 communities (from distinct geographic regions), which was not observed for the influenza A(H3N2) strains. Intra-host/intra-household influenza A(H3N2) sequence drift was identified in 2 households. The first was a synonymous mutation between the index case and a household contact, and the second a non-synonymous mutation between 2 serial samples taken at days 0 and 4 post enrolment from an HIV-infected secondary case. Limited inter-household sequence diversity was observed as highlighted by sharing of the same influenza strain between different households within each community. The limited intra-household sequence drift is in line with previous studies also using Sanger sequencing, corroborating the presence of strict selective bottlenecks that limit sequence variance. We were not able to directly ascertain the effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>6787ac65</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198101</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e3a:2835af05</id><author><name>Ziyaad Valley-Omar</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ziyaad Valley-Omar, Preetha Iyengar, Claire von Mollendorf, Stefano Tempia, Alexandra Moerdyk, Orienka Hellferscee, Neil Martinson, Meredith McMorrow, Ebrahim Variava, Katlego Masonoke, Adam L.

The adipose tissue (AT) contributes to systemic and B cell intrinsic inflammation, reduced B cell responses and secretion of autoimmune antibodies. In this study we show that adipocytes in the human obese subcutaneous AT (SAT) secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation, and consequent suboptimal immune responses in obese individuals, as we have previously shown. We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies. During the development of obesity, reduced oxygen and consequent hypoxia and cell death lead to further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, “self” protein antigens, cell-free DNA and lipids. All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of “self” antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>87853ac7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197472</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7ba:2835af05</id><author><name>Daniela Frasca</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Frasca, Alain Diaz, Maria Romero, Seth Thaller, Bonnie B.

We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198364</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>DSE promotes aggressive glioma cell phenotypes by enhancing HB-EGF/ErbB signaling</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198364</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198364</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Chieh Liao, Chih-Kai Liao, You-Huan Tsai, To-Jung Tseng, Li-Ching Chuang, Chyn-Tair Lan, Hung-Ming Chang, Chiung-Hui Liu&lt;/p&gt;
Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tumor microenvironment promotes glioma progression. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans appear in the ECM and on the cell surface, and can be catalyzed by dermatan sulfate epimerase to form chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) hybrid chains. Dermatan sulfate epimerase 1 (DSE) is overexpressed in many types of cancer, and CS/DS chains mediate several growth factor signals. However, the role of DSE in gliomas has never been explored. In the present study, we determined the expression of DSE in gliomas by consulting a public database and conducting immunohistochemistry on a tissue array. Our investigation revealed that DSE was upregulated in gliomas compared with normal brain tissue. Furthermore, high DSE expression was associated with advanced tumor grade and poor survival. We found high DSE expression in several glioblastoma cell lines, and DSE expression directly mediated DS chain formation in glioblastoma cells. Knockdown of DSE suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioblastoma cells. In contrast, overexpression of DSE in GL261 cells enhanced these malignant phenotypes and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tumor growth. Interestingly, we found that DSE selectively regulated heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF)-induced signaling in glioblastoma cells. Inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 with afatinib suppressed DSE-enhanced malignant phenotypes, establishing the critical role of the ErbB pathway in regulating the effects of DSE expression. This evidence indicates that upregulation of DSE in gliomas contributes to malignant behavior in cancer cells. We provide novel insight into the significance of DS chains in ErbB signaling and glioma pathogenesis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>3a14c1ae</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198364</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b78b:3dd877af</id><author><name>Wen-Chieh Liao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Chieh Liao, Chih-Kai Liao, You-Huan Tsai, To-Jung Tseng, Li-Ching Chuang, Chyn-Tair Lan, Hung-Ming Chang, Chiung-Hui Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Thin-plate splines were used to visualize these differences, and clearly show the differences which are focused on the ambulacral region of the blastoids, which are the primary food gathering point for these species.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020321?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Integral equation theory based direct and accelerated systematic coarse-graining approaches</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 21, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020321?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/21&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 21&lt;/a&gt;, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528178613000</published><fingerprint>4d75d4f2</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020321?af=R</link><crawled>1528356065737</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163d91ed1c9:63c5120:2835af05</id><author><name>S.

This paper presents the design and fabrication of a multi-layer and multi-chamber microchip system using thiol-ene ‘click chemistry’ aimed for drug transport studies across tissue barrier models. The fabrication process enables rapid prototyping of multi-layer microfluidic chips using different thiol-ene polymer mixtures, where porous Teflon membranes for cell monolayer growth were incorporated by masked sandwiching thiol-ene-based fluid layers. Electrodes for trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements were incorporated using low-melting soldering wires in combination with platinum wires, enabling parallel real-time monitoring of barrier integrity for the eight chambers. Additionally, the translucent porous Teflon membrane enabled optical monitoring of cell monolayers. The device was developed and tested with the Caco-2 intestinal model, and compared to the conventional Transwell system. Cell monolayer differentiation was assessed via &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; immunocytochemistry of tight junction and mucus proteins, P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) mediated efflux of Rhodamine 123, and brush border aminopeptidase activity. Monolayer tightness and relevance for drug delivery research was evaluated through permeability studies of mannitol, dextran and insulin, alone or in combination with the absorption enhancer tetradecylmaltoside (TDM). The thiol-ene-based microchip material and electrodes were highly compatible with cell growth. In fact, Caco-2 cells cultured in the device displayed differentiation, mucus production, directional transport and aminopeptidase activity within 9–10 days of cell culture, indicating robust barrier formation at a faster rate than in conventional Transwell models. The cell monolayer displayed high TEER and tightness towards hydrophilic compounds, whereas co-administration of an absorption enhancer elicited TEER-decrease and increased permeability similar to the Transwell cultures. The presented cell barrier microdevice constitutes a relevant tissue barrier model, enabling transport studies of drugs and chemicals under real-time optical and functional monitoring in eight parallel chambers, thereby increasing the throughput compared to previously reported microdevices.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>328caae4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197101</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914f:93d646dc</id><author><name>Hsih-Yin Tan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hsih-Yin Tan, Sofie Trier, Ulrik L.

Adult height is determined by both genetic characteristics and environmental factors in early life. Although previous studies have suggested that adult height is associated with risk of mortality, comprehensive associations between height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the Japanese population are unclear. We aimed to evaluate the associations between adult height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among Japanese men and women in a prospective cohort study. We investigated 107,794 participants (50,755 men and 57,039 women) aged 40 to 69 years who responded to the baseline questionnaire in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Participants were classified by quartile of adult height obtained from a self-reported questionnaire in men (&amp;lt;160cm, 160-163cm, 164-167cm, ≥168cm) and women (&amp;lt;149cm, 149-151cm, 152-155cm, ≥156cm). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality from all-cause, cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other cause mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. During follow-up, 12,320 men and 7,030 women died. Taller adult height was associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.83 (0.69–0.99); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.90–0.99)) and respiratory disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.69–1.03); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.87–0.97)), but was also associated with increased risk for overall cancer mortality (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.17 (1.07–1.28); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.04 (1.01–1.07)) in men. Taller adult height was also associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;149cm vs. ≥156cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.66–1.05); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.86–0.99)) in women.

Non-contact heart rate (HR) measurement from facial videos has attracted high interests due to its convenience and cost effectiveness. However, accurate and robust HR estimation under various realistic scenarios remain a very challenging problem. In this paper, we develop a novel system which can achieve a robust and accurate HR estimation under those challenging scenarios. First, to minimize tracking-artifacts arising from large head motions and facial expressions, we propose a joint face detection and alignment method which can produce alignment-friendly facial bounding boxes with reliable initial facial shapes, facilitating accurate and robust face alignment even in the presence of large pose variations and expressions. Second, different from most existing methods [1–5] which derive pulse signals from predetermined grid cells (i.e. local patches), our patches are varying-sized triangles generated adaptively to exclude negative effects from non-rigid facial motions. Third, we propose an adaptive patch selection method to choose patches which contain skin regions and are more likely to contain useful information, followed by an independent component analysis, for an accurate HR estimate. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our own dataset demonstrated that, comparing with the state-of-the-art methods [1–3], our method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by a large margin, ranging from 12% to 63%, and can provide a robust and accurate estimation under various challenging scenarios.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>75282d5e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197275</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7e:2835af05</id><author><name>Zhiwei Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhiwei Wang, Xin Yang, Kwang-Ting Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

Integrative analyses of the resulting multi-omics data, such as somatic mutation, copy number alteration (CNA), DNA methylation, miRNA, gene expression, and protein expression, offer the tantalizing possibilities of realizing the potential of precision medicine in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment by substantially improving our understanding of underlying mechanisms as well as the discovery of novel biomarkers for different types of cancers. However, such analyses present a number of challenges, including the heterogeneity of data types, and the extreme high-dimensionality of omics data. Methods: In this study, we propose a novel framework for integrating multi-omics data based on multi-view feature selection, an emerging research problem in machine learning research. We also present a novel multi-view feature selection algorithm, MRMR-mv, which adapts the well-known Min-Redundancy and Maximum-Relevance (MRMR) single-view feature selection algorithm for the multi-view settings. Results: We report results of experiments on the task of building a predictive model of cancer survival from an ovarian cancer multi-omics dataset derived from the TCGA database. Our results suggest that multi-view models for predicting ovarian cancer survival outperform both view-specific models (i.e., models trained and tested using one multi-omics data source) and models based on two baseline data fusion methods. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the potential of multi-view feature selection in integrative analyses and predictive modeling from multi-omics data.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525849200000</published><fingerprint>44e37708</fingerprint><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/317982v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1525883666384</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16345c0ffd0:c7aced:3dd877af</id><author><name>El-Manzalawy, Y.</name></author><description>Background: Large-scale collaborative precision medicine initiatives (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)) are yielding rich multi-omics data.

Results: We report results of experiments on the task of building a predictive model of cancer survival from an ovarian cancer multi-omics dataset derived from the TCGA database. Our results suggest that multi-view models for predicting ovarian cancer survival outperform both view-specific models (i.e., models trained and tested using one multi-omics data source) and models based on two baseline data fusion methods. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the potential of multi-view feature selection in integrative analyses and predictive modeling from multi-omics data.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196975</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Diffusion tensor MRI of the healthy brachial plexus</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196975</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196975</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jos Oudeman, Camiel Verhamme, Maurits P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Genetic variants of inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) that confer reduced ITPase activity are associated with protection against ribavirin(RBV)-induced hemolytic anemia in peginterferon(IFN)/RBV-based treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients with reduced ITPase activity showed improved treatment efficacy when treated with IFN/RBV. In addition, a genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene is associated with an improved response to IFN/RBV treatment. RBV has been an important component of IFN-containing regimens, and is currently recommended in combination with several IFN-free regimens for treatment of harder to cure HCV infections.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether genetic variations that reduce ITPase activity impact RBV-induced anemia in IFN-free/RBV regimens&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this study, genetic analyses were conducted in the PEARL-IV trial to investigate the effect of activity-reducing ITPA variants as well as IL28B polymorphism on anemia, platelet (PLT) counts, and virologic response in HCV genotype1a-infected patients treated with the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir±RBV.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Reduction in ITPase activity and homozygosity for the IL28Brs12979860 CC genotype protected against RBV-induced anemia. In patients receiving RBV, reduced ITPase activity was associated with reduced plasma RBV concentration and higher PLT counts. ITPase activity had no impact on response to DAA treatment, viral kinetics, or baseline IP-10 levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study demonstrates that genetics of ITPA and IL28B may help identify patients protected from RBV-induced anemia when treated with IFN-free regimens. Our work demonstrates for the first time that IL28B genetics may also have an impact on RBV-induced anemia. This may be of particular significance in patients with difficult-to-cure HCV infections, such as patients with decompensated cirrhosis where RBV-containing regimens likely will continue to be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>2d669e7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198296</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b94e:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Aparna Vasanthakumar</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aparna Vasanthakumar, Justin W.

In recent years, two-photon calcium imaging has become a standard tool to probe the function of neural circuits and to study computations in neuronal populations. However, the acquired signal is only an indirect measurement of neural activity due to the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent calcium indicators. Different algorithms for estimating spike rates from noisy calcium measurements have been proposed in the past, but it is an open question how far performance can be improved. Here, we report the results of the &lt;i&gt;spikefinder&lt;/i&gt; challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike rate inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity. The competition shows that benchmark challenges can drive algorithmic developments in neuroscience.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a1WS4uygAIc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>9b06fb00</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006157</link><crawled>1526924658806</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16383cd4876:d8bafa:abeb7260</id><author><name>Philipp Berens</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Berens, Jeremy Freeman, Thomas Deneux, Nicolay Chenkov, Thomas McColgan, Artur Speiser, Jakob H.

Here, we report the results of the &lt;i&gt;spikefinder&lt;/i&gt; challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike rate inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity. The competition shows that benchmark challenges can drive algorithmic developments in neuroscience.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a1WS4uygAIc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/srXrxyzrebQ/s41598-018-25243-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Surface Modification of SPIONs in PHBV Microspheres for Biomedical Applications</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25243-9/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25243_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>230</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>False</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25243-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25243-9</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surface Modification of SPIONs in PHBV Microspheres for Biomedical Applications&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surface Modification of SPIONs in PHBV Microspheres for Biomedical Applications, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25243-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25243-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Surface Modification of SPIONs in PHBV Microspheres for Biomedical Applications&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/srXrxyzrebQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525762800000</published><fingerprint>221ab1d8</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25243-9</link><crawled>1525772328510</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f1e1e3e:1467e8:3dd877af</id><author><name>Maizlinda I.

End-stage renal disease is strongly associated with progressive cardiovascular calcification (CVC) and there is currently no therapy targeted to treat CVC. SNF472 is an experimental formulation under development for treatment of soft tissue calcification. We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of SNF472 administration in rats and its inhibitory effects on CVC. SNF472 was studied in three rat models: (1) prevention of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with an intravenous SNF472 bolus of 1 mg/kg SNF472, (2) inhibition of progression of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with a subcutaneous SNF472 bolus of 10 or 60 mg/kg SNF472, starting after calcification induction, (3) CVC in adenine-induced uremic rats treated with 50 mg/kg SNF472 via i.v. 4h -infusion. Uremic rats presented lower plasma levels of SNF472 than control animals after i.v. infusion. CVC in non-uremic rats was inhibited by 60–70% after treatment with SNF472 and progression of cardiac calcification completely blocked. Development of CVC in uremic rats was inhibited by up to 80% following i.v. infusion of SNF472. SNF472 inhibits the development and progression of CVC in uremic and non-uremic rats in the same range of SNF472 plasma levels but using in each case the required dose to obtain those levels. These results collectively support the development of SNF472 as a novel therapeutic option for treatment of CVC in humans.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>defe3df3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197061</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee0:2835af05</id><author><name>Miguel D.

Despite the extensive use of dexamethasone(DEX) in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia for many years, the mechanisms of dexamethasone - resistance has not been fully understood. We choose GSE94302 from GEO database aiming to identify key genes that contribute to the DEX resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Differentially expressed gene(DEGs) are selected by using GEO2R tools. A total of 837 DEGs were picked out, including 472 up-regulated and 365 down-regulated DEGs. All the DEGs were underwent gene ontology(GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome(KEGG) pathway analysis. In addition, the DEGs-encoded protein-protein interaction (PPI) was screened by using Cytoscape and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes(STRING). Total 20 genes were found as key genes related to DEX resistance with high degree of connectivity, including CDK1, PCNA, CCNB1, MYC, KPNA2, AURKA, NDC80, HSPA4, KIF11, UBE2C, PIK3CG, CD44, CD19, STAT1, DDX41, LYN, BCR, CD48, JAK1 and ITGB1.

Despite the extensive use of dexamethasone(DEX) in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia for many years, the mechanisms of dexamethasone - resistance has not been fully understood. We choose GSE94302 from GEO database aiming to identify key genes that contribute to the DEX resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Differentially expressed gene(DEGs) are selected by using GEO2R tools. A total of 837 DEGs were picked out, including 472 up-regulated and 365 down-regulated DEGs. All the DEGs were underwent gene ontology(GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome(KEGG) pathway analysis. In addition, the DEGs-encoded protein-protein interaction (PPI) was screened by using Cytoscape and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes(STRING). Total 20 genes were found as key genes related to DEX resistance with high degree of connectivity, including CDK1, PCNA, CCNB1, MYC, KPNA2, AURKA, NDC80, HSPA4, KIF11, UBE2C, PIK3CG, CD44, CD19, STAT1, DDX41, LYN, BCR, CD48, JAK1 and ITGB1.

Chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is an inflammatory and neuropathic pain disorder characterized by the involvement of the autonomic nervous system with sensory, autonomic, motor, skin, and bone changes. At present, universally accepted consensus criteria for CRPS are not yet established, despite the diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). Various hypotheses for the pathophysiology of CRPS have been proposed; as a result, current therapeutic modalities are varied. General epidemiological data on CRPS are necessary for effective management. However, recent data on the epidemiology of CRPS in Korea are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and other epidemiological features of CRPS in the general population in Korea. In this study on the epidemiology of CRPS in Korea, population-based medical data acquired from 51,448,491 subscribers to the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) from 2011 to 2015 were analyzed, including the incidence, distribution by the CRPS type, regional distribution, monthly distribution, medical costs, and healthcare resource-utilization. The findings indicated that the incidence of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years in 2015 and was correlated with patient age and sex. CRPS types included type I (63%) and type II (37%); moreover, the number of individuals with CRPS I have shown a growing trend since 2011. There was no monthly distribution, but there was regional variation according to the province. The medical departments managing CRPS I the most were orthopedics, internal medicine, anesthesiology and pain medicine, in order; however, patients with CRPS spent more money per visit in the departments of rehabilitation medicine, and anesthesiology and pain medicine. The incidence rate of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years with an increasing trend, which was correlated with patient age in the 70s and female sex. CRPS type I was more common than CRPS type II; in addition, constant increase in medical expenses, regional imbalance, and differences in medical expense among medical specialties should be considered for early management of patients to reduce the disease burden in Korea. Sharing of knowledge about the diagnostic criteria of CRPS are also needed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>b0f9d0ed</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198147</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b784:3dd877af</id><author><name>Hyungtae Kim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyungtae Kim, Cheol-Hyeong Lee, Sung-Hun Kim, Yeon-Dong Kim&lt;/p&gt;

In this study on the epidemiology of CRPS in Korea, population-based medical data acquired from 51,448,491 subscribers to the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) from 2011 to 2015 were analyzed, including the incidence, distribution by the CRPS type, regional distribution, monthly distribution, medical costs, and healthcare resource-utilization. The findings indicated that the incidence of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years in 2015 and was correlated with patient age and sex. CRPS types included type I (63%) and type II (37%); moreover, the number of individuals with CRPS I have shown a growing trend since 2011. There was no monthly distribution, but there was regional variation according to the province. The medical departments managing CRPS I the most were orthopedics, internal medicine, anesthesiology and pain medicine, in order; however, patients with CRPS spent more money per visit in the departments of rehabilitation medicine, and anesthesiology and pain medicine. The incidence rate of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years with an increasing trend, which was correlated with patient age in the 70s and female sex. CRPS type I was more common than CRPS type II; in addition, constant increase in medical expenses, regional imbalance, and differences in medical expense among medical specialties should be considered for early management of patients to reduce the disease burden in Korea. Sharing of knowledge about the diagnostic criteria of CRPS are also needed.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05074-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>What to do to improve postgraduate mental health</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05074-4/d41586-018-05074-4_15744884.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05074-4</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to do to improve postgraduate mental health&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do to improve postgraduate mental health, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05074-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05074-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Greater awareness must be matched with steps such as better training for supervisors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>147</engagement><published>1525849200000</published><fingerprint>2054631</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05074-4</link><crawled>1525853617625</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16343f67dd9:94c87a:3dd877af</id><author><name>NA</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to do to improve postgraduate mental health&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do to improve postgraduate mental health, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05074-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05074-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Greater awareness must be matched with steps such as better training for supervisors.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011786?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Large deviation theory for the kinetics and energetics of turnover of enzyme catalysis in a chemiostatic flow</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>False</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011786?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/17&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525667423000</published><fingerprint>51990b74</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011786?af=R</link><crawled>1525793219829</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163405ce4f5:39c5c2:93d646dc</id><author><name>Biswajit Das</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/532/eaau2601?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science Signaling current issue</title></origin><title>Bacterial manipulation of host cell metabolism</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/532/eaau2601.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/532/eaau2601?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; exotoxin manipulates host cell metabolism by inducing amino acid starvation and inhibiting mTORC1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527616231000</published><fingerprint>d33a0c07</fingerprint><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/532/eaau2601?rss=1</link><crawled>1527617755574</crawled><id>RuJRIXzN26JgDGk9YhlIBfh4YrPi0r+1c4exm9G1IBw=_163ad1d19b6:211c225:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>VanHook, A.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Limited studies have investigated geographic accessibility to a nearby community pharmacy for elderly which is an essential determinant of the access to medications and pharmacy services. This research identified pharmacy deserts and investigated availability of different types of community pharmacies and their services for elderly enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The state of Pennsylvania in the US was used as a case to demonstrate the geographic accessibility to community pharmacy and services for elderly enrolled in SPAP. The locations of community pharmacies and households of elderly enrolled in SPAP were derived from Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly programs’ database. The street addresses were geocoded and the distance to a nearby community pharmacy was calculated for study sample using the haversine formula. The demographic and geographic data were aggregated to Census Tracts and pharmacy deserts were identified using the predefined criteria. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to determine whether there are statistical differences in the socio-demographic profiles and distribution of different types of community pharmacies and their services in pharmacy deserts and non-deserts. This research used hot spot analyses at county level to identify clusters of pharmacy deserts, areas with high concentration of different racial/ethnic groups and clusters of high densities of chain and independent pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The Spatial analysis revealed that 39% and 61% Census Tracts in Pennsylvania were pharmacy deserts and non-deserts respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Pharmacy deserts were found to have significantly more females, married and white elderly and fewer blacks and Hispanics compared to pharmacy non-deserts. Pharmacy deserts had significantly fewer chain and independent pharmacies and less delivery and 24-hour services in pharmacies than pharmacy non-deserts. Hot spot analyses showed that clusters of pharmacy deserts were more concentrated in southcentral, northwest and northeast regions of the state which represent rural areas and overlapped with clusters of high concentration of white individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that urban-rural inequality, racial/ethnic disparity and differences in availability of pharmacies and their services exist between pharmacy deserts and non-deserts.

S100A16 is a conserved member of the S100 protein family in mammals. Its upregulation was observed in many tumors and is related to malignant transformation. In this study, we explored the independent prognostic value of &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by performing a retrospective study, using data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Besides, by using deep sequencing data in TCGA-LUAD, we also explored the association between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation and copy number alterations (CNAs). Results showed that the primary LUAD tissues (N = 514) had significantly elevated &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression compared with the normal lung tissues (N = 59). Based on OS data of 502 primary LUAD cases, we found that high &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was correlated with inferior OS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.197, 95%CI: 1.050–1.364, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) and RFS (HR: 1.206, 95%CI: 1.045–1.393, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011). By examining the DNA methylation data in TCGA-LUAD, we found that some &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; DNA CpG sites were generally hypermethylated in normal tissues, but not in LUAD tissues. Regression analysis identified a moderately negative correlation between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation. In comparison, although DNA amplification (+1/+2) was frequent (378/511, 74%) in LUAD patients, it was not associated with increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression. Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>de986340</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197402</link><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ef:2835af05</id><author><name>De Chen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by De Chen, Linjie Luo, Chao Liang&lt;/p&gt;

Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/hYca6UsSD5E/acs.jpcb.8b02159</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Effects of Urea and TMAO on Lipid Self-Assembly under Osmotic Stress Conditions</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02159/20180510/images/medium/jp-2018-02159x_0006.gif</url><height>304</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02159</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02159</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02159/20180510/images/medium/jp-2018-02159x_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02159&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The interplay with bacteria is of crucial importance for the interaction of multicellular organisms with their environments. Studying the associations between the nematode model organisms &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus pacificus&lt;/i&gt; with bacteria constitutes a powerful system to investigate these interactions at a mechanistic level. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt; is found in association with scarab beetles in nature and recent studies revealed the succession and dynamics of this nematode and its microbiome during the decomposition of one particular host species, the rhinoceros beetle &lt;i&gt;Oryctes borbonicus&lt;/i&gt; on La Réunion Island. However, these studies were performed using culture-free methods, with no attempt made to establish bacterial cultures from the beetle-nematode ecosystem and to investigate the effects of these microbes on life history traits in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we establish and characterize a collection of 136 bacterial strains that have been isolated from scarab beetles and figs, another &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus&lt;/i&gt;-associated environment, as a resource for studying their effect on various nematode traits. Classification based on 16S sequencing identified members of four bacterial phyla with the class of Gammaproteobacteria representing the majority with 81 strains. Assessing the survival of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt; on individual bacteria allowed us to propose candidate groups of pathogens such as Bacillaceae, Actinobacteria, and &lt;i&gt;Serratia&lt;/i&gt;. In combination with chemoattraction data, it was revealed that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt; is able to recognize and avoid certain groups of pathogens, but not others. Our collection of bacterial strains forms a natural resource to study the effects of bacterial diet on development and other traits.

Using 3D anatomical landmarks from adult human head MRIs, we assessed the magnitude of inter-operator differences in Procrustes-based geometric morphometric analyses. An in depth analysis of both absolute and relative error was performed in a subsample of individuals with replicated digitization by three different operators. The effect of inter-operator differences was also explored in a large sample of more than 900 individuals. Although absolute error was not unusual for MRI measurements, including bone landmarks, shape was particularly affected by differences among operators, with up to more than 30% of sample variation accounted for by this type of error. The magnitude of the bias was such that it dominated the main pattern of bone and total (all landmarks included) shape variation, largely surpassing the effect of sex differences between hundreds of men and women. In contrast, however, we found higher reproducibility in soft-tissue nasal landmarks, despite relatively larger errors in estimates of nasal size. Our study exemplifies the assessment of measurement error using geometric morphometrics on landmarks from MRIs and stresses the importance of relating it to total sample variance within the specific methodological framework being used. In summary, precise landmarks may not necessarily imply negligible errors, especially in shape data; indeed, size and shape may be differentially impacted by measurement error and different types of landmarks may have relatively larger or smaller errors. Importantly, and consistently with other recent studies using geometric morphometrics on digital images (which, however, were not specific to MRI data), this study showed that inter-operator biases can be a major source of error in the analysis of large samples, as those that are becoming increasingly common in the &apos;era of big data&apos;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>7d3a5c55</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197675</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709405f:2835af05</id><author><name>Amro Daboul</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amro Daboul, Tatyana Ivanovska, Robin Bülow, Reiner Biffar, Andrea Cardini&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Individuals under community corrections supervision may be at increased risk for food insecurity because they face challenges similar to other marginalized populations, such as people experiencing housing instability or substance users. The prevalence of food insecurity and its correlates have not been studied in the community corrections population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2016, surveying 304 probationers in Rhode Island to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity, identify food acquisition methods, and determine characteristics of groups most at-risk for food insecurity. We used chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests to assess differences in sociodemographics and eating and food acquisition patterns, GIS to examine geospatial differences, and ordinal logistic regression to identify independent correlates across the four levels of food security.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Nearly three-quarters (70.4%) of the participants experienced food insecurity, with almost half (48.0%) having very low food security. This is substantially higher than the general population within the state of Rhode Island, which reported a prevalence of 12.8% food insecurity with 6.1% very low food security in 2016. Participants with very low food security most often acquired lunch foods from convenience stores (and less likely from grocery stores) compared to the other three levels of food security. Participants did not differ significantly with regards to places for food acquisition related to breakfast or dinner meals based upon food security status. In adjusted models, being homeless (AOR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.31, 4.18) and depressed (AOR 3.12, 95% CI: 1.98, 4.91) were independently associated with a greater odds of being in a food insecure group. Compared to having help with meals none of the time, participants who reported having meal help all of the time (AOR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.64), most of the time (AOR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.61), and some of the time (AOR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.98) had a lower odds of being in a food insecure group. Food insecure participants resided in different neighborhoods than food secure participants. The highest density of food insecure participants resided in census tracts with the lowest median incomes for the general population. The areas of highest density for each level of food security for our participants were in the census tracts with the lowest levels of full-time employment for the general population.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of food insecurity and very low food security were markedly higher in our probation population compared to the general RI population. These findings suggest that access to food on a regular basis is a challenge for adults on probation. Depression and being homeless were independently associated with a greater odds of being in a food insecure group. In addition to intervening directly on food insecurity, developing interventions and policies that address the contributing factors of food insecurity, such as safe housing and treatment for depression, are critical.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>7b552398</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198598</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0b6:2835af05</id><author><name>Kimberly R.

The organization of proteins into macromolecular complexes and their quantitative distribution across these complexes is, therefore, of great biological and clinical significance. In this paper we describe an integrated experimental and computational technique to quantify hundreds of protein complexes in a single operation. The method consists of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to fractionate native protein complexes, SWATH/DIA mass spectrometry to precisely quantify the proteins in each SEC fraction and the computational framework CCprofiler to detect and quantify protein complexes by error-controlled, complex-centric analysis using prior information from generic protein interaction maps. Our analysis of the HEK293 cell line proteome delineates 462 complexes composed of 2127 protein subunits. The technique identifies novel subcomplexes and assembly intermediates of central regulatory complexes while assessing the quantitative subunit distribution across them.

In this paper we describe an integrated experimental and computational technique to quantify hundreds of protein complexes in a single operation. The method consists of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to fractionate native protein complexes, SWATH/DIA mass spectrometry to precisely quantify the proteins in each SEC fraction and the computational framework CCprofiler to detect and quantify protein complexes by error-controlled, complex-centric analysis using prior information from generic protein interaction maps. Our analysis of the HEK293 cell line proteome delineates 462 complexes composed of 2127 protein subunits. The technique identifies novel subcomplexes and assembly intermediates of central regulatory complexes while assessing the quantitative subunit distribution across them. We make the toolset CCprofiler freely accessible, and provide a web platform, SECexplorer, for custom exploration of the HEK293 proteome modularity.</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><keywords><item>Sustainability Science</item></keywords><title>Near-term deployment of carbon capture and sequestration from biorefineries in the United States [Sustainability Science]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4875</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/19/4875/F2.medium.gif</url><height>326</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4875.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Capture and permanent geologic sequestration of biogenic CO2 emissions may provide critical flexibility in ambitious climate change mitigation.

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Dye-less chromoendoscopy is an emerging technology for colorectal polyp characterization. Herein, we investigated whether the newly introduced I-scan optical enhancement (OE) can accurately predict polyp histology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in real-time.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective three-phased study, 84 patients with 230 diminutive colorectal polyps were included. During the first two study phases, five endoscopists assessed whether analysis of polyp colour, surface and vascular pattern under i-scan OE can differentiate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; between adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. Finally, junior and experienced endoscopists (JE, EE, each n = 4) not involved in the prior study phases made a post hoc diagnosis of polyp histology using a static i-scan OE image database. Histopathology was used as a gold-standard in all study phases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The overall accuracy of i-scan OE for histology prediction was 90% with a sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative prediction value (NPV) of 91%, 90%, 86% and 94%, respectively. In high confidence predictions, the diagnostic accuracy increased to 93% with sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 94%, 91%, 89% and 96%. Colonoscopy surveillance intervals were predicted correctly in ≥ 90% of patients. In the post hoc analysis EE predicted polyp histology under i-scan OE with an overall accuracy of 91%. After a single training session, JE achieved a comparable diagnostic performance for predicting polyp histology with i-scan OE.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The histology of diminutive colorectal polyps can be accurately predicted with i-scan OE &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in real-time.

Mortality is higher for adults admitted to hospital and for babies born on weekends compared to weekdays. This study compares in-hospital mortality and in children admitted to hospital on weekends and weekdays. Details for all acute medical admissions to hospitals in Scotland for children aged ≤16 years between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; January 2000 and 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; December 2013 were obtained. Death was linked to day of admission. There were 570,403 acute medical admissions and 334 children died, including 83 who died after an admission on Saturday or Sunday and 251 who died following admission between Monday and Friday. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for a child dying after admission on a weekend compared to weekday was 1.03 [95% CI 0.80 to 1.32]. The OR for a child admitted over the weekend requiring intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) care was 1.24 [1.16 to 1.32], but the absolute number of admissions to HDU and ICU per day were similar on weekends and weekdays. We see no evidence of increased in-hospital paediatric mortality after admission on a weekend. The increased risk for admission to ITU or HDU with more serious illness over weekends is explained by fewer less serious admissions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>8a9917cd</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197494</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122a:93d646dc</id><author><name>Rebecca Barwise-Munro</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca Barwise-Munro, Maryam Al-Mahtot, Steve Turner&lt;/p&gt;

Genome-scale metabolic models have become the tool of choice for the global analysis of microorganism metabolism, and their reconstruction has attained high standards of quality and reliability. Improvements in this area have been accompanied by the development of some major platforms and databases, and an explosion of individual bioinformatics methods. Consequently, many recent models result from “à la carte” pipelines, combining the use of platforms, individual tools and biological expertise to enhance the quality of the reconstruction. Although very useful, introducing heterogeneous tools, that hardly interact with each other, causes loss of traceability and reproducibility in the reconstruction process. This represents a real obstacle, especially when considering less studied species whose metabolic reconstruction can greatly benefit from the comparison to good quality models of related organisms. This work proposes an adaptable workspace, AuReMe, for sustainable reconstructions or improvements of genome-scale metabolic models involving personalized pipelines. At each step, relevant information related to the modifications brought to the model by a method is stored. This ensures that the process is reproducible and documented regardless of the combination of tools used. Additionally, the workspace establishes a way to browse metabolic models and their metadata through the automatic generation of ad-hoc local wikis dedicated to monitoring and facilitating the process of reconstruction. AuReMe supports exploration and semantic query based on RDF databases. We illustrate how this workspace allowed handling, in an integrated way, the metabolic reconstructions of non-model organisms such as an extremophile bacterium or eukaryote algae. Among relevant applications, the latter reconstruction led to putative evolutionary insights of a metabolic pathway.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oV3GF0mvv-g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>5</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>c9c685d3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006146</link><crawled>1527098195054</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1638e253c6e:4bf8d:59412e84</id><author><name>Méziane Aite</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Méziane Aite, Marie Chevallier, Clémence Frioux, Camille Trottier, Jeanne Got, María Paz Cortés, Sebastián N.

Sequencing of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; genomes has revealed they harbor a high number of biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC), which uncovered their enormous potentiality to encode specialized metabolites. However, these metabolites are not usually produced under standard laboratory conditions. In this manuscript we report the activation of BGCs for antimycins, carotenoids, germicidins and desferrioxamine compounds in &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces argillaceus&lt;/i&gt;, and the identification of the encoded compounds. This was achieved by following different strategies, including changing the growth conditions, heterologous expression of the cluster and inactivating the &lt;i&gt;adpAa&lt;/i&gt; or overexpressing the &lt;i&gt;abrC3&lt;/i&gt; global regulatory genes.

The establishment of agricultural matrices generally involves deforestation, which leads to fragmentation of the remaining forest. This fragmentation can affect forest dynamics both positively and negatively. Since most animal species are affected, certain groups can be used to measure the impact of such fragmentation. This study aimed to measure the impacts of agricultural crops (matrices) on ant communities of adjacent lower montane Atlantic rainforest fragments. We sampled nine forest fragments at locations surrounded by different agricultural matrices, namely: coffee (3 replicates); sugarcane (3); and pasture (3). At each site we installed pitfall traps along a 500 m transect from the interior of the matrix to the interior of the fragment (20 pitfall traps ~25 m apart). Each transect was partitioned into four categories: interior of the matrix; edge of the matrix; edge of the fragment; and interior of the fragment. For each sample site, we measured ant species richness and ant community composition within each transect category. Ant richness and composition differed between fragments and matrices. Each sample location had a specific composition of ants, probably because of the influence of the nature and management of the agricultural matrices. Species composition in the coffee matrix had the highest similarity to its corresponding fragment. The variability in species composition within forest fragments surrounded by pasture was greatest when compared with forest fragments surrounded by sugarcane or, to a lesser extent, coffee. Functional guild composition differed between locations, but the most representative guild was ‘generalist’ both in the agricultural matrices and forest fragments. Our results are important for understanding how agricultural matrices act on ant communities, and also, how these isolated forest fragments could act as an island of biodiversity in an ‘ocean of crops’.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>718c265b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197697</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2333:2835af05</id><author><name>Diego Santana Assis</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Santana Assis, Iracenir Andrade Dos Santos, Flavio Nunes Ramos, Katty Elena Barrios-Rojas, Jonathan David Majer, Evaldo Ferreira Vilela&lt;/p&gt;

And that’s the currency of the realm: do you want to build up larger molecules from smaller precursors in a controlled fashion? You’re going to have to make bonds when and where you want them to form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those organometallic reagents are tricky beasts, whether catalytic or stoichiometric. Just understanding what the actual structures of some of them are has occupied people for years on end, because a given system can adopt a whole range of structures – and thus form completely different reagents – depending on solvent, temperature, counterions, concentration, added salts, stoichiometry, order of addition, and so on. To make matters more interesting, some of the actual reactive species are formed only in small, transient amounts, which makes proving their existence even more fraught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201802087&quot;&gt;a recent example&lt;/a&gt;. One of the many things you can do with Grignard reagents, a classic organometallic species if ever there was, is to couple them onto vinyl bromides and haloalkenes in general, with iron catalysis. It turns out, though, that the yields for this are far better when the reaction is run in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) than in any other solvent (an effect discovered in 1998, over twenty years since the reaction was first reported). That one’s not exactly the first choice for this sort of thing, so it’s interesting to know that it works so well. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-300x180.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-300x180.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-768x460.jpeg 768w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP.jpeg 996w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13567&quot; height=&quot;180&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had already been figured out that if you take methylmagnesium bromide and an iron(III) salt in THF, that a new species forms: magnesium(penta-THF) chloride cation and a penta-iron-octa-methyl cluster anion. That was thought to be the active methyl-coupling reagent, but the yields are never that great in THF (which is probably what led to the solvent screening work that uncovered the NMP effect). Now we finally know what that works. In that new solvent, a completely different complex salt forms: magnesium hexa-NMP cation (+2 charge), with two trimethyliron anions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those irons are exceptionally reactive; you really don’t see alkyliron species without other stabilizing ligands on them very often, but for some reason you get them here. NMP is a pretty highly coordinating solvent, so in the absence of experimental evidence you’d figure that the solvent is in there on both the iron and magnesium centers. But it turns out that it’s just the latter (as suggested by magnetic circular dichroism spectra in solution, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ssbauer_spectroscopy&quot;&gt;Mössbauer spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; along with X-ray diffraction on isolated crystals of the complex. Mössbauer is not the first technique you reach for (since you need an appropriate gamma-ray source) but it’s extremely sensitive to several different kinds of changes that affect the energy levels of sensitive nuclei, which are mostly metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know, and another piece of knowledge gets added to the organometallic pile, and another idea for future reagents and reactions gets queued up. Eventually we’ll understand this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>3</engagement><published>1527602714000</published><fingerprint>e25bf7f9</fingerprint><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13566</link><crawled>1527603225306</crawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_163ac3f62da:1fbbae9:2835af05</id><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>Synthetic organic chemists spend a lot of time using organometallic coupling reactions, because they can be such great ways to make carbon-carbon (and carbon-heteroatom) bonds.

Moreover, the phenotypic associations of these driver genes are poorly understood. This report aims to reveal the phenotypic impacts of a group of consensus driver genes in HCC. We used MutSigCV and OncodriveFM modules implemented in the IntOGen pipeline to identify consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts comprising 1,494 samples in total. To access their global impacts, we used TCGA mutations and copy number variations to predict the transcriptomics data, under generalized linear models. We further investigated the associations of the consensus driver genes to patient survival, age, gender, race and risk factors. We identify 10 consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts in total. Integrative analysis of driver mutations, copy number variations and transcriptomic data reveals that these consensus driver mutations and their copy number variations are associated with majority (62.5%) of the mRNA transcriptome, but only a small fraction (8.9%) of miRNAs. Genes associated with TP53, CTNNB1, and ARID1A mutations contribute to the tripod of most densely connected pathway clusters. These driver genes are significantly associated with patients&apos; overall survival.

Moreover, the phenotypic associations of these driver genes are poorly understood. This report aims to reveal the phenotypic impacts of a group of consensus driver genes in HCC. We used MutSigCV and OncodriveFM modules implemented in the IntOGen pipeline to identify consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts comprising 1,494 samples in total. To access their global impacts, we used TCGA mutations and copy number variations to predict the transcriptomics data, under generalized linear models. We further investigated the associations of the consensus driver genes to patient survival, age, gender, race and risk factors. We identify 10 consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts in total. Integrative analysis of driver mutations, copy number variations and transcriptomic data reveals that these consensus driver mutations and their copy number variations are associated with majority (62.5%) of the mRNA transcriptome, but only a small fraction (8.9%) of miRNAs. Genes associated with TP53, CTNNB1, and ARID1A mutations contribute to the tripod of most densely connected pathway clusters. These driver genes are significantly associated with patients&apos; overall survival. Some driver genes are significantly linked to HCC gender (CTNNB1, ALB, TP53 and AXIN1), race (TP53 and CDKN2A), and age (RB1) disparities. This study prioritizes a group of consensus drivers in HCC, which collectively show vast impacts on the phenotypes. These driver genes may warrant as valuable therapeutic targets of HCC.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/zLEm8ks7sjA/s41467-018-04473-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Absence of dynamic strain aging in an additively manufactured nickel-base superalloy</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04473-5/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4473_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>466</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04473-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04473-5</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Absence of dynamic strain aging in an additively manufactured nickel-base superalloy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absence of dynamic strain aging in an additively manufactured nickel-base superalloy, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04473-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04473-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Detrimental serrated plastic flow via dynamic strain aging (DSA) in conventionally processed nickel superalloys usually occurs during high temperature deformation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Use of the pediatric emergency department (PED) for low-acuity health issues is a growing problem, contributing to overcrowding, longer waits and higher health system costs. This study examines an educational initiative aimed at reducing low-acuity PED visits. The initiative, implemented at an academic pediatric hospital, saw PED physicians share a pamphlet with caregivers to educate them about appropriate PED use and alternatives. Despite early impacts, the initiative was not sustained. This study analyzes the barriers and enablers to physician participation in the initiative, and offers strategies to improve implementation and sustainability of similar future initiatives.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-two PED physicians were invited to participate in a semi-structured individual interview assessing their views about low-acuity visits, their pamphlet use, barriers and enablers to pamphlet use, and the initiative’s potential for reducing low-acuity visits. Suggestions were solicited for improving the initiative and reducing low-acuity visits. Constant comparative method was used during analysis. Codes were developed inductively and iteratively, then grouped according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Efforts to ensure study credibility included seeking participant feedback on the findings.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-three PED physicians were interviewed (55%). Barriers and enablers for pamphlet use were identified and grouped according to five of the 14 TDF domains: social/professional role and identity; beliefs about consequences; environmental context and resources; social influences; and emotions.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The TDF provided an effective approach to identify the key elements influencing physician participation in the educational initiative.

The genus &lt;i&gt;Anthroherpon&lt;/i&gt; Reitter, 1889 exhibits the most pronounced troglomorphic characters among Coleoptera, and represents one of the most spectacular radiations of subterranean beetles. However, radiation, diversification, and biogeography of this genus have never been studied in a phylogenetic context. This study provides a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the &lt;i&gt;Anthroherpon&lt;/i&gt; radiation, using a dated molecular phylogeny as a framework for understanding &lt;i&gt;Anthroherpon&lt;/i&gt; diversification, reconstructing the ancestral range, and exploring troglomorphic diversity. Based on 16 species and 22 subspecies, i.e. the majority of &lt;i&gt;Anthroherpon&lt;/i&gt; diversity, we reconstructed the phylogeny using Bayesian analysis of six loci, both mitochondrial and nuclear, comprising a total of 4143 nucleotides. In parallel, a morphometric analysis was carried out with 79 landmarks on the body that were subjected to geometric morphometrics. We optimized morphometric features to phylogeny, in order to recognize the way troglomorphy was expressed in different clades of the tree, and did character evolution analyses. Finally, we reconstructed the ancestral range of the genus using BioGeoBEARS. Besides further elucidating the suprageneric classification of the East-Mediterranean Leptodirini, our main findings also show that &lt;i&gt;Anthroherpon&lt;/i&gt; dates back to the Early Miocene (ca. 22 MYA) and that the genus diversified entirely underground. Biogeographic reconstruction of the ancestral range shows the origin of the genus in the area comprising three high mountains in western Montenegro, which is in the accordance with the available data on the paleogeography of the Balkan Peninsula.

Background &lt;p&gt;Child marriage harms girls’ health and hinders progress toward development goals.

In cancer research, for example, the open cancer resources such as TCGA and TARGET do not provide matched tissue samples for every cancer or cancer subtype. The recent GTEx project has profiled samples from healthy individuals, providing an excellent resource for this field, yet the feasibility of using GTEx samples as the reference remains unanswered. Methods: We analyze RNA-Seq data processed from the same computational pipeline and systematically evaluate GTEx as a potential reference resource. We use those cancers that have adjacent normal tissues in TCGA as a benchmark for the evaluation. To correlate tumor samples and normal samples, we explore top varying genes, reduced features from principal component analysis, and encoded features from an autoencoder neural network. We first evaluate whether these methods can identify the correct tissue of origin from GTEx for a given cancer and then seek to answer whether disease expression signatures are consistent between those derived from TCGA and from GTEx. Results: Among 32 TCGA cancers, 18 cancers have less than 10 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. Among three methods, autoencoder performed the best in predicting tissue of origin, with 12 of 14 cancers correctly predicted. The reason for misclassification of two cancers is that none of normal samples from GTEx correlate well with any tumor samples in these cancers. This suggests that GTEx has matched tissues for the majority cancers, but not all. While using autoencoder to select proper normal samples for disease signature creation, we found that disease signatures derived from normal samples selected via an autoencoder from GTEx are consistent with those derived from adjacent samples from TCGA in many cases. Interestingly, choosing top 50 mostly correlated samples regardless of tissue type performed reasonably well or even better in some cancers.

Background &lt;p&gt;Although epidemiological evidence for the beneficial effect of low alcohol consumption on myocardial infarction is strong, the impact of heavy drinking episodes is less clear.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between the risk for acute myocardial infarction occurrence and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Our hospital-based case-control study comprised 374 participants (187 newly diagnosed patients with myocardial infarction and 187 controls, individually matched by gender, age, and place of residence). This study was performed in Kragujevac (a city in Serbia) during 2010. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The history of alcohol consumption in patients with acute myocardial infarction and their controls did not differ significantly: the percentage of those that were consuming alcohol was slightly higher in cases (54.5%) than in controls (50.3%). The habit of binge drinking during the previous 12 months was significantly more common in cases (25.1%) than in controls (12.8%): adjusted OR = 2.2 (95%CI = 1.2–4.2, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for trend = 0.015. Analysis of binge drinking by age, gender and place of residence revealed that the increase in risk for acute myocardial infarction was associated with older age (adjusted OR = 5.1, 95%CI = 1.7–15.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for trend = 0.010), male gender (adjusted OR = 2.3, 95%CI = 1.1–5.2, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for trend = 0.028) and rural place of residence (adjusted OR = 4.8, 95%CI = 1.3–18.5, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for trend = 0.033).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that binge drinking is associated with twice the risk for myocardial infarction compared to not drinking.

To examine the 20-year trends in the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity among children aged 0–6 years between 1995 and 2015 in Harbin, China, we selected altogether 49,553 children aged 0–6 years old by using a multistage stratified cluster sampling methods in Harbin, one provincial capital city in northeast China in 1995, 2005 and 2015. Height and weight information of the children were collected. We used the child growth standards of World Health Organization to calculate the Z-scores for body mass index (BMI). Cut-offs recommended by World Health Organization and International Obesity Task Force were used to define overweight and obesity for each children. We found there is no difference between boys’ BMI and girls’ among newborns in each survey point (p&gt;0.05), but in older age groups, the BMI of boys was higher than that of girls (p&amp;lt;0.05). From 1995 to 2015, the average BMI was increasing continuously among boys older than 42 months and girls older than 48 months (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for linear trend across year) in Harbin. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 2.6% in 1995 to 7.6% in 2015. For every 10-year the risk of combined overweight and obesity in children aged 0–6 years increased by 167% (95%CI: 146%, 188%, p&amp;lt;0.01). The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in most age subgroups showed an increasing trend over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for trend test across survey year). The age when the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity dramatically increased was earlier in 2015 than that in 2005 and 1995. In conclusion, there was an increasing trend of the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity during the past 20 years in Harbin and the age when the prevalence dramatically increased became earlier. Comprehensive intervention should be undertaken among younger children to prevent and control children’s overweight and obesity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>1370fb6f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198032</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b77e:3dd877af</id><author><name>Wei Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Liu, Qin Li, Hui Li, Jia Li, Hai-Jun Wang, Bin Li&lt;/p&gt;

When incorporating experimentally-measured RNA structure compared to predicted one, the improvement on in vivo data increases. By visualizing the binding specificities, we can gain novel biological insights underlying the mechanism of protein RNA-binding.

Due to the importance of RNA-binding proteins in gene regulation, a great number of studies have been conducted, resulting in a large amount of RNA-Seq datasets. However, these datasets usually do not have structured organization of metadata, which limits their potentially wide use. To bridge this gap, the metadata of a comprehensive set of publicly available mouse RNA-Seq datasets with perturbed RNA-binding proteins were collected and integrated into a database called RBPMetaDB. This database contains 278 mouse RNA-Seq datasets for a comprehensive list of 163 RNA-binding proteins.

In addition, we found that DNA-binding activities are significantly enriched among RNA-binding proteins in RBPMetaDB, suggesting that prior studies of these DNA- and RNA-binding factors focus more on DNA-binding activities instead of RNA-binding activities. This result reveals the opportunity to efficiently reuse these data for investigation of the roles of their RNA-binding activities.

You may be wondering how that works, or how it can possibly work, especially when you hear that the nanoscale reactions are transition-metal catalyzed. After all, we usually spend a good deal of effort trying to make sure that our assay candidates are cleaned up and (most especially) free of metal contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is the type of protein assay. It’s not a functional readout, which is where the metals can give you all sorts of false positives, but rather just a binding assay, done by mass spec. That’s generally done in an is-anything-there binary mode, but in this paper, they’re actually titrating in the amount of protein to get a rough order of affinities. Still, one strike against that sort of detection has always been “But you’re only measuring binding, not real inhibition, etc.” That’s still true, but now you can always consider going the targeted protein degradation route, in which case all you need is some sort of binder. As mentioned here in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/26/dna-libraries-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;another recent post&lt;/a&gt;, the same consideration applies to DNA-encoded libraries, which also just give you a binding affinity readout – the Merck authors don’t mention this aspect, but it’s a real consideration these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, they did a test with 20 reactions each using amide formation, Suzuki couplings, and Buchwald-Hartwig C-N couplings (which certainly cover a lot of real-world medicinal chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/24/boring-or-the-medicinal-chemists-toolkit&quot;&gt;for better or worse&lt;/a&gt;).  They used the small-scale reaction setup to screen conditions for the latter two, in a smaller-scale version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. In each case, they also synthesized the products on a 20mg scale and purified them by traditional means, in order to compare them with the nanoscale assay results. (These all produced compounds in known kinase inhibitor space, which I’m afraid is also pretty realistic.) And the correlation was strong: the affinity-mass-spec assay could indeed pick out the potent compounds (as it should) without giving false positives along the way (since you’re looking for the particular mass signature of the product associated with the enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this confirmation in hand, the group then took one of the intermediates and coupled it in each individual well of a 384 plate after an automated reaction conditions screen. They got 345 products and rank-ordered them by titrating in CHK1 protein, with a mass spec readout each time, and identified three new potent binders. These reactions are done on about 0.05mg of material each, so you can plow through quite a few of them without plowing through a lot of starting material, and generate a lot of SAR data rather quickly. The reaction screening is a key part of the process – taking robust but generic coupling conditions across that same 384 set only gave 158 products (and thus missed several nanomolar inhibitors). Overall, to optimize the 384 set and assay them took 3114 reactions, consuming about 120mg of the starting material. You are not going to be able to do that by hand. I don’t care how much of a machine you are in the lab, you’re not more of a machine than a machine is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors note, machine-learning algorithms may eventually make it easier to navigate both reaction condition space and SAR space, but for now, we really have to attack these things empirically, and this (in general) seems like the way to do it. Small scale, highly automated, optimized, high-throughput: you’re not going to be able to sort things so thoroughly any other way. And since we often have to resort to brute force, we should be letting the machines take that on whenever possible, because brute force is exactly what they do the best. That was proven on the high-throughput screening end of the business many years ago, and it’s true on the compound synthesis end of things, too. Bring ’em on.&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common in adults. People with OSAS have a higher risk of experiencing traffic accidents and occupational injuries (OIs). We aimed to clarify the diagnostic performance of a three-channel screening device (ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) compared with the gold standard of full-night attended polysomnography (PSG) among hospital outpatients not referred for sleep-related symptoms. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether manual revision of the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore enhanced diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We investigated 68 patients with OI and 44 without OI recruited from the University Hospital Basel emergency room, using a cross-sectional study design. Participating patients spent one night at home with ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and within 2 weeks slept for one night at the sleep laboratory. We reanalyzed all ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; data after manual revision.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified significant correlations between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) autoscore and the AHI derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.525; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) autoscore and that derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.722; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore showed a sensitivity and specificity of 82% when comparing AHI ≥5 with the cutoff for AHI and/or ODI ≥15 from PSG. In Bland Altman plots the mean difference between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore and PSG was 2.75 with SD ± 8.80 (β = 0.034), and between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI revised score and PSG -1.50 with SD ± 9.28 (β = 0.060).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity compared with the gold standard (full-night attended PSG). However, Bland Altman plots revealed substantial fluctuations between PSG and ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore respectively manually revised score. This spread for the AHI from a clinical perspective is large, and therefore the results have to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, our findings suggest that there is no clinical benefit in manually revising the ApneaLinkTM autoscore.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>fabc39ca</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198315</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb929:3dd877af</id><author><name>Michel Hug</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michel Hug, Katrin Uehli, Stig Solbach, Stefanie Brighenti-Zogg, Selina Dürr, Sabrina Maier, Jörg Daniel Leuppi, David Miedinger&lt;/p&gt;

Measuring red blood cell (RBC) deformability has become important for clinical disease diagnostics. Various methods for measuring RBC deformability have been developed; however, they require costly and large instruments, long measuring time, and skilled personnel. In this study, we present a three-dimensional-printed mini-disk (3D-PMD) for measuring RBC deformability to overcome the previous limitations. For a miniaturized and low-cost setup, the 3D-PMD was fabricated by a 3D printing technique, which had not yet been used for fabricating a lab-on-a-compact disk (LOCD). Using a 3D printing technique, a multi-layered fluidic channel on the mini CD could be fabricated easily. During rotation by a spinning motor, the difference of the length of compressed RBCs in the fluidic channel was measured and analysed as compressibility indices (CIs) of normal and glutaraldehyde-treated hardened RBCs. The rotation speed and time were decided as 3000 rpm and 30 min, respectively, at which the difference of CI values between normal and hardened RBCs was largest (CI&lt;sub&gt;normal&lt;/sub&gt;-CI&lt;sub&gt;hardened&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.195).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>4f51c17a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197619</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709405d:2835af05</id><author><name>Hyunjung Lim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunjung Lim, Seung Min Back, Jeonghun Nam, Hyuk Choi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Chinese parents have access to domestic and foreign vaccines for their children. Their vaccine preferences are unclear, especially given recent pharmaceutical quality scandals and widely held beliefs deriving from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This study characterized parental beliefs about the safety and effectiveness of Chinese and foreign vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In May 2014, caregivers of young children at public immunization clinics in Shanghai, China, responded to a survey on vaccine perceptions. The two outcomes (differential belief in the effectiveness and safety of foreign vs domestic vaccines) were separately regressed onto demographic predictors in multinomial logistic regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 618 caregivers, 56% thought the effectiveness of domestic and foreign vaccines were comparable; 33% thought domestic were more effective and 11% foreign. Two-thirds thought foreign and domestic vaccines had similar safety; 11% thought domestic were safer and 21% thought foreign were safer. Compared to college graduates, those with a high school education or less had greater odds of believing domestic vaccines were more effective, and also had greater odds of believing imported vaccines were safer. Greater trust in TCM was not associated with differential beliefs in the effectiveness or safety of domestic vs foreign vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although there is no evidence that foreign and domestic vaccines differ in either effectiveness or safety, less educated caregivers in China (but not those with greater trust in TCM) appear to believe such differences exist. Further exploration of the causes of these beliefs may be necessary in order to optimize vaccine communications in China.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>e8f8e0c0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197437</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761227:93d646dc</id><author><name>Zhuoying Huang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhuoying Huang, Xiaodong Sun, Abram L.

Further exploration of the causes of these beliefs may be necessary in order to optimize vaccine communications in China.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197259</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Environmental concentrations of metformin exposure affect aggressive behavior in the Siamese fighting fish, &amp;lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197259</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197259</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ronald David MacLaren, Kathryn Wisniewski, Christina MacLaren&lt;/p&gt;
Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 μg/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male &lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&lt;/i&gt;. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 μg/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>2d653650</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197259</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b7a:93d646dc</id><author><name>Ronald David MacLaren</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ronald David MacLaren, Kathryn Wisniewski, Christina MacLaren&lt;/p&gt;

Plants are an important and inexhaustible source of bioactive molecules in food, medicine, agriculture, and industry. In this study, we performed systematic liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolic profiling coupled with antioxidant assays for indigenous plant family extracts. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis of LC-MS datasets for the extracts of 34 plant species belonging to the families Aceraceae, Asteraceae, and Rosaceae showed that these species were clustered according to their respective phylogenies. In particular, seven Aceraceae species were clearly demarcated with higher average antioxidant activities, rationalizing their application for bioconversion studies. On the basis of further evaluation of the interspecies variability of metabolic profiles and antioxidant activities among Aceraceae family plants, we found that &lt;i&gt;Acer tataricum&lt;/i&gt; (TA) extracts were clearly distinguished from those of other species, with a higher relative abundance of tannin derivatives. Further, we detected a strong positive correlation between most tannin derivatives and the observed higher antioxidant activities. Following &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus oryzae&lt;/i&gt;-mediated fermentative bioconversion of &lt;i&gt;Acer&lt;/i&gt; plant extracts, we observed a time-correlated (0–8 days) linear increase in antioxidant phenotypes for all species, with TA having the highest activity. Temporal analysis of the MS data revealed tannin bioconversion mechanisms with a relatively higher abundance of gallic acid (m/z 169) accumulated at the end of 8 days, particularly in TA. Similarly, quercetin precursor (glycoside) metabolites were also transformed to quercetin aglycones (m/z 301) in most &lt;i&gt;Acer&lt;/i&gt; plant extracts.

Initially designed to identify children’s movement impairments in clinical settings, the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2) is also widely used to evaluate children’s movement in research. Standardised scores on the test are calculated using parametric methods under the assumption of normally-distributed data. In a pilot study with thirty five 8–10 year old children (i.e., in Age Band 2 of the MABC-2), we found that maximal performance was often reached. These ‘ceiling effects’ created distributions of scores that may violate parametric assumptions. Tests of normality, skew, and goodness-of-fit revealed this violation, most clearly on three of the eight sub-tests. A strong deviation from normality was again observed in a sample of 161 children (8–10 years, Experiment 1), however ceiling effects were reduced by modifying the scoring methods, and administering items designed for older children when maximal performance was reached. Experiment 2 (n = 81, 7–10 years) further refined the administration and scoring methods, and again improved the distributions of scores. Despite reducing ceiling effects, scores remained non-parametrically distributed, justifying non-parametric analytic approaches. By randomly and repeatedly resampling from the raw data, we generated non-parametric reference distributions for assigning percentiles to each child’s performance, and compared the results with the standardised scores. Distributions of scores obtained with both parametric and non-parametric methods were skewed, and the methods resulted in different rankings of the same data. Overall, we demonstrate that some MABC-2 item scores are not normally-distributed, and violate parametric assumptions. Changes in administering and scoring may partially address these issues. We propose that resampling or other non-parametric methods are required to create new reference distributions to which an individual child’s performance can be referred. The modifications we propose are preliminary, but the implication is that a new standardisation is required to deal with the non-parametric data acquired with the MABC-2 performance test.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>e819a5fd</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198426</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84554:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Blandine French</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Blandine French, Nicole J.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Active recovery is often used by athletes after strenuous exercise or competition but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We observed a time × group interaction effect for VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; (p = 0.013). Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026). No significant effects were observed for all other variables.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Active recovery increased aspects of central, rather than muscle recovery.

The anti-inflammatory properties of sand fly saliva favor the establishment of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania infantum&lt;/i&gt; infection. In contrast, an antibody response against &lt;i&gt;Lutzomyia longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; saliva is often associated with a protective cell-mediated response against canine visceral leishmaniasis. Genetic studies may demonstrate to what extent the ability to secrete anti-saliva antibodies depends on genetic or environmental factors. However, the genetic basis of canine antibody response against sand fly saliva has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with the anti-&lt;i&gt;Lu&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; salivary IgG response in 189 dogs resident in endemic areas in order to provide information for prophylactic strategies. Dogs were classified into five groups based on serological and parasitological diagnosis and clinical evaluation. Anti-salivary gland homogenate (SGH) IgG levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and genotyped using a SNP chip with 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The following linear regression model was fitted: IgG level = mean + origin + sex + age + use of a repellent collar, and the residuals were assumed as pseudo-phenotypes for the association test between phenotypes and genotypes (GWA). A component of variance model that takes into account polygenic and sample structure effects (EMMAX) was employed for GWA. Phenotypic findings indicated that anti-SGH IgG levels remained higher in exposed and subclinically infected dogs than in severely diseased dogs even in regression model residuals. Five associated markers were identified on chromosomes 2, 20 and 31. The mapped genes included &lt;i&gt;CD180&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RP105&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MITF&lt;/i&gt; related to the rapid activation of B lymphocytes and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. The findings pointed to chromosomal segments useful for functional confirmation studies and a search for adjuvant molecules of the anti-saliva response.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>6ce598ac</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197215</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee9:2835af05</id><author><name>Luís F.

Finally, our results indicate a route for the experimental stabilization of the trimer, crucial for the understanding of the physiological role of such aggregates in vitamin E body trafficking.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05242-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Why North Korea&apos;s denuclearization plan doesn&apos;t convince this nuclear expert</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05242-6/d41586-018-05242-6_15781138.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05242-6</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why North Korea&apos;s denuclearization plan doesn&apos;t convince this nuclear expert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why North Korea&apos;s denuclearization plan doesn&apos;t convince this nuclear expert, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05242-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05242-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Suh Kune-yull says vast ﻿supplies of uranium and a huge nuclear workforce make rearmament a real possibility.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>44</engagement><published>1527058800000</published><fingerprint>1e2707b</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05242-6</link><crawled>1527081400914</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1638d24fa52:75cd382:93d646dc</id><author><name>Mark Zastrow</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why North Korea&apos;s denuclearization plan doesn&apos;t convince this nuclear expert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why North Korea&apos;s denuclearization plan doesn&apos;t convince this nuclear expert, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05242-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05242-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Suh Kune-yull says vast ﻿supplies of uranium and a huge nuclear workforce make rearmament a real possibility.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4670.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Structural homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity in mature and adult newborn rat hippocampal granule cells [Neuroscience]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4670</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/20.cover-source.jpg?itok=tq2Qj6AB</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4670.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Adult newborn hippocampal granule cells (abGCs) contribute to spatial learning and memory. abGCs are thought to play a specific role in pattern separation, distinct from developmentally born mature GCs (mGCs).

A collaboration between the University of Helsinki, LifeArc (which looks to be one of the small companies in the former Stevenage pharma campus) and Cyclofluidic reports development of inhibitors against hepsin, a serine protease enzyme that is a potential cancer target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so uncontroversial. The same group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/onc2015248&quot;&gt;had identified&lt;/a&gt; a micromolar hepsin inhibitor from some late-1990s urokinase inhibitor chemical matter, but this compound (naturally) still had activity against urokinase. The goal was to improve potency while working away from urokinase, which is just the sort of thing that med-chem teams everywhere spend their efforts on. The enzyme seems to need an amidine/guanadine functional group for potency, and a screen of commercially available derivatives gave another micromolar hit with less urokinase activity as a new starting point. 142 new compounds were prepared, optimizing along until a final compound was reached with 22 nM potency and 200x more selectivity in the counterscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is good: that’s what a team of medicinal chemists are there to do. What makes this paper interesting (and those who have heard of Cyclofluidic will have already caught on) is that the chemistry was automated in a flow reactor, and the enzyme assay results were fed back into the software which generated SAR predictions for the next round of synthesis. Importantly, the screening assay is part of the automated system as well, and the entire loop (synthesis/purification/assay) is claimed to take around 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this actually worked was that the automated system would run through a particular SAR space, generating a series of compounds, and at that point the humans involved would have a look at how things were going. Subsequent runs might include new SAR building blocks or changes to the algorithms that evaluated the results. So it’s not like they walked away for a weekend and came back 142 compounds later to a selective nanomolar inhibitor – but neither is it the case that people made all these compounds and selected the next ones to make, either. This was machine-assisted compound development, very much analogous to what Gary Kasparov has termed “centaur” chess, where humans evaluate their ideas with the aid of software to come up with even stronger moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needs to be noted that the chemistry involved was very straightforward (amide and sulfonamide formation, for the most part) and the assays were quite robust. This was close (as have been the other things reported in this vein) to a best-case example for such closed-loop automated SAR work, but then again these are early days. I also noticed that several of the co-authors on the paper now have different addresses, which makes one wonder how long ago this project was actually done. My point is that automated synthesis (thanks to human ingenuity) is getting better all the time, as are the methods for in-line assays and especially those for evaluation of chemical space and SAR. Thanks to human ingenuity, we are very likely going to be freeing up time to apply that ingenuity to other things than banging out obvious SAR compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, though, you are a human chemist (as so many of my readers are, to steal a joke from G. K. Chesterton), and you feel that you are watching your livelihood being stolen right in front of your eyes, consider what in this case the machines are taking from you. You are being deprived of the chance to do some of the most boring chemistry in the world in the most routine fashion imaginable. My own feelings are that any machine that takes away from me the necessity to crank out 142 amide reactions by hand is welcome to it. This is the med-chem equivalent of doing the laundry, and I have a machine for that, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>6</engagement><published>1527166700000</published><fingerprint>2459877a</fingerprint><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13562</link><crawled>1527167027695</crawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_163923f89ef:7e26a46:93d646dc</id><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>This is not a paper that’s going to make everyone who reads it happy, but it needs to be read anyway.

We have previously reported that astrocytic GABA,...</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/1038?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><title>Finding a community in the lab</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/1038.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/1038?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527788426000</published><fingerprint>25625b50</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/1038?rss=1</link><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d0990:2835af05</id><author><name>Bradshaw, N.</name></author></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197794</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Correction: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis express a complex pro-inflammatory, pro-repair, angiogenic activation pattern, likely associated with macrophage iron accumulation</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197794</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197794</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526590800000</published><updated>1526590800000</updated><fingerprint>5cfad6d7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197794</link><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85446:93d646dc</id><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198262</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Enterobacter cloacae&amp;lt;/i&gt; administration induces hepatic damage and subcutaneous fat accumulation in high-fat diet fed mice</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198262</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198262</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anniina Keskitalo, Eveliina Munukka, Raine Toivonen, Maija Hollmén, Heikki Kainulainen, Pentti Huovinen, Sirpa Jalkanen, Satu Pekkala&lt;/p&gt;
Accumulating evidence indicates that gut microbiota plays a significant role in obesity, insulin resistance and associated liver disorders. Family &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and especially &lt;i&gt;Enterobacter cloacae&lt;/i&gt; strain B29 have been previously linked to obesity and hepatic damage. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain unclear. Therefore, we comprehensively examined the effects of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC® 13047™) administration on host metabolism of mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). C57BL/6N mice were randomly divided into HFD control, chow control, and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; treatment groups. The &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; treatment group received live bacterial cells in PBS intragastrically twice a week, every other week for 13 weeks. Both control groups received PBS intragastrically. After the 13-week treatment period, the mice were sacrificed for gene and protein expression and functional analyses. Our results show that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; administration increased subcutaneous fat mass and the relative proportion of hypertrophic adipocytes. Both subcutaneous and visceral fat had signs of decreased insulin signaling and elevated lipolysis that was reflected in higher serum glycerol levels. In addition, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae -&lt;/i&gt;treated mice had significantly higher hepatic AST and AST/ALT ratio, and their liver histology indicated fibrosis, demonstrating that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; administration promotes hepatic damage in HFD fed mice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>eaddb019</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198262</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb927:3dd877af</id><author><name>Anniina Keskitalo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anniina Keskitalo, Eveliina Munukka, Raine Toivonen, Maija Hollmén, Heikki Kainulainen, Pentti Huovinen, Sirpa Jalkanen, Satu Pekkala&lt;/p&gt;

Accurate reporting and forecasting of &lt;i&gt;PM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration are important for improving public health. In this paper, we propose a partial differential equation (PDE) model, specially, a linear diffusive equation, to describe the spatial-temporal characteristics of &lt;i&gt;PM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; in order to make short-term prediction. We analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of a real dataset from China’s National Environmental Monitoring and validate the PDE-based model in terms of predicting the &lt;i&gt;PM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of the next day by the former days’ history data. Our experiment results show that the PDE model is able to characterize and predict the process of &lt;i&gt;PM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; transport. For example, for 300 continuous days of 2016, the average prediction accuracy of the PDE model over all city-regions is 93% or 83% based on different accuracy definitions. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use PDE-based model to study &lt;i&gt;PM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; prediction in both temporal and spatial dimensions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>77da760b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197666</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f43:2835af05</id><author><name>Yufang Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yufang Wang, Haiyan Wang, Shuhua Chang, Adrian Avram&lt;/p&gt;

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) transplant has been reported to be a potential treatment for burn wounds. However, the effects of autogenicity and allogenicity of ADSCs on burn wound healing have not been investigated and the method for using ADSCs still needs to be established. This study compared the healing effects of autologous and allogenic ADSCs and determined an optimal method of using ADSCs to treat acute burn wounds. Experiments were performed in 20 male Wistar rats (weight, 176–250 g; age, 6–7 weeks). Two identical full-thickness burn wounds (radius, 4 mm) were created in each rat. ADSCs harvested from inguinal area and characterized by their high multipotency were injected into burn wounds in the original donor rats (autologous ADSCs group) or in other rats (allogenic ADSCs group). The injection site was either the wound center or the four corners 0.5 cm from the wound edge. The reduction of burn surface areas in the two experimental groups and in control group were evaluated with Image J software for 15 days post-wounding to determine the wound healing rates. Wound healing was significantly faster in the autologous ADSCs group compared to both the allogenic ADSCs group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;) and control group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;). Wound healing in the allogenic ADSC group did not significantly differ from that in control group. Notably, ADSC injections 0.5cm from the wound edge showed significantly improved healing compared to ADSCs injections in the wound center (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;). This study demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of ADSCs in treating acute burn wounds in rats. However, only autologous ADSCs improved healing in acute burn wounds; allogenic ADSCs did not. This study further determined a superior location of using ADSCs injections to treat burn wounds including the injection site. Future studies will replicate the experiment in a larger and long-term scale burn wounds in higher mammalian models to facilitate ADSCs therapy in burn wound clinical practice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>6586f9a0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197744</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094066:2835af05</id><author><name>Yu-Wei Chang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu-Wei Chang, Yi-Chia Wu, Shu-Hung Huang, Hui-Min David Wang, Yur-Ren Kuo, Su-Shin Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Cells switch between quiescence and proliferation states for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regeneration. At the restriction point (R-point), cells become irreversibly committed to the completion of the cell cycle independent of mitogen. The mechanism involving hyper-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) and activation of transcription factor E2F is linked to the R-point passage. However, stress stimuli trigger exit from the cell cycle back to the mitogen-sensitive quiescent state after Rb hyper-phosphorylation but only until APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; inactivation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to investigate the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation in mammalian cells with respect to mitogen and stress signals. The model integrates the current mechanistic knowledge and accounts for the recent experimental observations with cells exiting quiescence and proliferating cells. We show that Cyclin E:Cdk2 couples Rb-E2F and APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; bistable switches and temporally segregates the R-point and the G1/S transition. A redox-dependent mutual antagonism between APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; and its inhibitor Emi1 makes the inactivation of APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; bistable. We show that the levels of Cdk inhibitor (CKI) and mitogen control the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation. Further, we propose that shifting of the mitogen-induced transcriptional program to G2-phase in proliferating cells might result in an intermediate Cdk2 activity at the mitotic exit and in the immediate inactivation of APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The Hedgehog family of morphogens has long been known to utilize, through the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), the heterotrimeric G protein G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in both canonical and noncanonical forms of signaling. Other G proteins, while not specifically utilized by Smo, may nonetheless provide access to some of the events controlled by it. We reported several years ago that the G protein G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; activates one or more forms of the Gli family of transcription factors. While the Gli transcription factors are well known targets for Smo, the uncertain mechanism of activation by G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and the identity of the targeted Gli(s) limited predictions as to the extent to which G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; might mimic Smo’s actions. We evaluate here the potential for overlap in G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and Smo signaling using C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 cells as models of osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively. We find in C3H10T1/2 cells that a constitutively active form of Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; (Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL) increases Gli1 mRNA, as does a constitutively active form of Smo (SmoA1). We find as well that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL induces alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteogenesis, albeit the induction is far less substantial than that achieved by SmoA1. In 3T3-L1 cells both Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 markedly suppress adipogenic differentiation as determined by triglyceride accumulation. RNA sequencing reveals that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 regulate many of the same genes but that quantitative and qualitative differences exist. Differences also exist, we find, between SmoA1 and purmorphamine, an agonist for Smo. Therefore, while comparisons of constitutively active proteins are informative, extrapolations to the setting of agonists require care.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>b82f7974</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197442</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8f:93d646dc</id><author><name>Xueshui Guo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xueshui Guo, Natalia A.

Therefore, while comparisons of constitutively active proteins are informative, extrapolations to the setting of agonists require care.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5798.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Estrogen receptor {beta} controls proliferation of enteric glia and differentiation of neurons in the myenteric plexus after damage [Neuroscience]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5798</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/22.cover-source.jpg?itok=b6MBtk2B</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5798.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Injury to the enteric nervous system (ENS) can cause several gastrointestinal (GI) disorders including achalasia, irritable bowel syndrome, and gastroparesis.

Channel catfish (&lt;i&gt;Ictalurus punctatus&lt;/i&gt;) is a highly adaptive species and has been used as a research model for comparative immunology, physiology, and toxicology among ectothermic vertebrates.

Genus &lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus&lt;/i&gt; has a wide distribution in North Africa and in the Middle East. In the present study, we modeled the habitat suitability of two Omani species of the genus (&lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt;) to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on their distribution.

The potential distribution for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt; in the current time covers the southern coastal regions of Oman, Yemen, the Horn of Africa, and Socotra Island, but the suitable regions were reduced in the future prediction and limited to Yemen, Socotra Island, and Oman. There have not been any records of the species outside of Oman. Analysis of habitat suitability for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt; indicated that the species is restricted to the Al Hajar Mountain of Oman and the southeast coastal region of Iran, but there are no records of the species from Iran. Because mean diurnal range will not be influenced by climate change in future, the potential distribution of the species is not expected to be changed in 2050. All predicted models were performed with the highest AUC (more than 0.97) using the Maxent method.

ZFP36 RBPs are prominent inflammatory regulators linked to autoimmunity and cancer, but functions in adaptive immunity are less clear. We used HITS-CLIP to define ZFP36 targets in mouse T cells, revealing unanticipated actions in regulating T cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions. Transcriptome and ribosome profiling showed that ZFP36 represses mRNA target abundance and translation, notably through novel AU-rich sites in coding sequence. Functional studies revealed that ZFP36 regulates early T cell activation kinetics cell autonomously, by attenuating activation marker expression, limiting T cell expansion, and promoting apoptosis. Strikingly, loss of ZFP36 in vivo accelerated T cell responses to acute viral infection and enhanced anti-viral immunity.

ZFP36 RBPs are prominent inflammatory regulators linked to autoimmunity and cancer, but functions in adaptive immunity are less clear. We used HITS-CLIP to define ZFP36 targets in mouse T cells, revealing unanticipated actions in regulating T cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions. Transcriptome and ribosome profiling showed that ZFP36 represses mRNA target abundance and translation, notably through novel AU-rich sites in coding sequence. Functional studies revealed that ZFP36 regulates early T cell activation kinetics cell autonomously, by attenuating activation marker expression, limiting T cell expansion, and promoting apoptosis. Strikingly, loss of ZFP36 in vivo accelerated T cell responses to acute viral infection and enhanced anti-viral immunity. These findings uncover a critical role for ZFP36 RBPs in restraining T cell expansion and effector functions, and suggest ZFP36 inhibition as a strategy to enhance immune-based therapies.</description><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33057</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197117</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Patients with stage 3 compared to stage 4 liver fibrosis have lower frequency of and longer time to liver disease complications</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197117</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197117</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Page Axley, Sandhya Mudumbi, Shabnam Sarker, Yong-Fang Kuo, Ashwani Singal&lt;/p&gt;
Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Advanced liver fibrosis is an important predictor of liver disease progression and mortality, and current guidelines recommend screening for complications of cirrhosis once patients develop F3 fibrosis. Our study compared liver disease progression and survival in patients with stage 3 (F3) and stage 4 (F4) fibrosis on liver biopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective study of patients with F3 or F4 on liver biopsy followed for development of liver disease complications (variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy); hepatocellular carcinoma, and survival (overall and transplant free survival).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2488 patients receiving liver biopsy between 01/02 and 12/12, a total of 294 (171 F3) were analyzed. Over a median follow up period of 3 years, patients with F4 (mean age 53 years, 63% male) compared to F3 (mean age 49 years, 43% male) had higher five year cumulative probability of any decompensation (38% vs. 14%, p&amp;lt;0.0001), including variceal bleed (10% vs. 4%, p = 0.014), ascites (21% vs. 9%, p = 0.0014), and hepatic encephalopathy (14% vs. 5%, p = 0.003). F4 patients also had lower overall 5-year survival (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.003) and transplant free survival (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.002). Probability of hepatocellular carcinoma in 5 years after biopsy was similar between F3 and F4 (1.2% vs. 2%, p = 0.54).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Compared to F4 stage, patients with F3 fibrosis have decreased risk for development of liver disease complications and better survival.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To compile a list of genes that have been reported to be affected by external ionizing radiation (IR) and to assess their performance as candidate biomarkers for individual human radiation dosimetry.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eligible studies were identified through extensive searches of the online databases from 1978 to 2017. Original English-language publications of microarray studies assessing radiation-induced changes in gene expression levels in human blood after external IR were included. Genes identified in at least half of the selected studies were retained for bio-statistical analysis in order to evaluate their diagnostic ability.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;24 studies met the criteria and were included in this study. Radiation-induced expression of 10,170 unique genes was identified and the 31 genes that have been identified in at least 50% of studies (12/24 studies) were selected for diagnostic power analysis. Twenty-seven genes showed a significant Spearman’s correlation with radiation dose. Individually, TNFSF4, FDXR, MYC, ZMAT3 and GADD45A provided the best discrimination of radiation dose &amp;lt; 2 Gy and dose ≥ 2 Gy according to according to their maximized Youden’s index (0.67, 0.55, 0.55, 0.55 and 0.53 respectively). Moreover, 12 combinations of three genes display an area under the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) curve (AUC) = 1 reinforcing the concept of biomarker combinations instead of looking for an ideal and unique biomarker.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Gene expression is a promising approach for radiation dosimetry assessment. A list of robust candidate biomarkers has been identified from analysis of the studies published to date, confirming for example the potential of well-known genes such as FDXR and TNFSF4 or highlighting other promising gene such as ZMAT3.

Infants from an early age have a bias to attend more to faces than non-faces and after 5 months are particularly attentive to fearful faces. We examined the specificity of this “fear bias” in 5-, 7-, and 12-month-old infants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 269) and 36-month-old children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 191) and whether its development is associated with features of the early rearing environment, specifically maternal anxiety and depression symptoms. Attention dwell times were assessed by measuring the latencies of gaze shifts from a stimulus at fixation to a new stimulus in the visual periphery. In infancy, dwell times were shorter for non-face control stimuli vs. happy faces at all ages, and happy vs. fearful, but not angry, faces at 7 and 12 months. At 36 months, dwell times were shorter for non-faces and happy faces compared to fearful and angry faces. Individual variations in attention dwell times were not associated with mothers’ self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms at either age. The results suggest that sensitivity to fearful faces precedes a more general bias for threat-alerting stimuli in early development. We did not find evidence that the initial manifestation of these biases is related to moderate variations in maternal depression or anxiety symptoms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>8e92d384</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197424</link><crawled>1526493611198</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a1c04be:41f7c57:3dd877af</id><author><name>Jukka M.

We did not find evidence that the initial manifestation of these biases is related to moderate variations in maternal depression or anxiety symptoms.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/HtYdIlRU2To/s41467-018-04277-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Silicon-oriented regio- and enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>584</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04277-7/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4277_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04277-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04277-7</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silicon-oriented regio- and enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silicon-oriented regio- and enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04277-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04277-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hydroformylation of 1,2-disubstituted alkenes usually occurs at the α position of the directing heteroatom.

Background &lt;p&gt;Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, second only to respiratory tract infections and particularly prevalent within primary care. Conventional detection of UTIs is culture, however, return of results can take between 24 and 72 hours. The introduction of a point of care (POC) test would allow for more timely identification of UTIs, facilitating improved, targeted treatment. This study aimed to obtain consensus on the criteria required for a POC UTI test, to meet patient need within primary care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Criteria for consideration were compiled by the research team. These criteria were validated through a two-round Delphi process, utilising an expert panel of healthcare professionals from across Europe and United States of America. Using web-based questionnaires, panellists recorded their level of agreement with each criterion based on a 5-point Likert Scale, with space for comments. Using median response, interquartile range and comments provided, criteria were accepted/rejected/revised depending on pre-agreed cut-off scores.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The first round questionnaire presented thirty-three criteria to the panel, of which 22 were accepted. Consensus was not achieved for the remaining 11 criteria. Following response review, one criterion was removed, while after revision, the remaining 10 criteria entered the second round. Of these, four were subsequently accepted, resulting in 26 criteria considered appropriate for a POC test to detect urinary infections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study generated an approved set of criteria for a POC test to detect urinary infections. Criteria acceptance and comments provided by the healthcare professionals also supports the development of a multiplex point of care UTI test.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>9da6da12</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198595</link><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:6683351:3dd877af</id><author><name>Nichola-Jane M.

Interpersonal needs are associated with suicide. However, no interpersonal needs questionnaire has been validated in Asia. The psychometric properties of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire were examined in a sample of 340 young male adults in Singapore. This questionnaire measures proximal causes of desire for suicide using the extent to which individuals believe that they are a burden to others (perceived burdensomeness) and the extent to which they believe their needs are not met (thwarted belongingness). Confirmatory factor analysis found that a two-factor model of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness provided an adequate fit for the data. Internal consistency was excellent. Concurrent, convergent, predictive, and discriminant validity was demonstrated. The findings showed that the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire provides a valid measure of interpersonal needs in young Asian males. Thus, the instrument can be utilized to test the interpersonal psychological theory of suicidal behavior.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>cfe6d42</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198839</link><crawled>1528394402297</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db67c9f9:679b31d:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Dorothy C.

There are no defined correlates of protection for any intracellular pathogen, including the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/i&gt;, which causes tularemia. Evaluating vaccine efficacy against sporadic diseases like tularemia using field trials is problematic, and therefore alternative strategies to test vaccine candidates like the &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; Live Vaccine Strain (LVS), such as testing in animals and applying correlate measurements, are needed. Recently, we described a promising correlate strategy that predicted the degree of vaccine-induced protection in mice given parenteral challenges, primarily when using an attenuated &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; strain. Here, we demonstrate that using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in this approach predicts LVS-mediated protection against respiratory challenge of Fischer 344 rats with fully virulent &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tularensis&lt;/i&gt;, with exceptional sensitivity and specificity. Rats were vaccinated with a panel of LVS-derived vaccines and subsequently given lethal respiratory challenges with Type A &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tularensis&lt;/i&gt;. In parallel, PBLs from vaccinated rats were evaluated for their functional ability to control intramacrophage &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; growth in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; co-culture assays. PBLs recovered from co-cultures were also evaluated for relative gene expression using a large panel of genes identified in murine studies. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; control of LVS intramacrophage replication reflected the hierarchy of protection. Further, despite variability between individuals, 22 genes were significantly more up-regulated in PBLs from rats vaccinated with LVS compared to those from rats vaccinated with the variant LVS-R or heat-killed LVS, which were poorly protective. These genes included IFN-γ, IL-21, NOS2, LTA, T-bet, IL-12rβ2, and CCL5. Most importantly, combining quantifications of intramacrophage growth control with 5–7 gene expression levels using multivariate analyses discriminated protected from non-protected individuals with greater than 95% sensitivity and specificity. The results therefore support translation of this approach to non-human primates and people to evaluate new vaccines against &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; and other intracellular pathogens.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>112a33f3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198140</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd86:3dd877af</id><author><name>Roberto De Pascalis</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roberto De Pascalis, Andrew Hahn, Helen M.

DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are important DNA lesions induced by endogenous crosslinking agents such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde, as well as ionizing radiation, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, and abortive action of some enzymes. Due to their very bulky nature, they are expected to interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis and DNA repair. DPCs are highly genotoxic and the ability of cells to deal with them is relevant for many chemotherapeutic interventions. However, interactions of DNA polymerases with DPCs have been poorly studied due to the lack of a convenient experimental model. We have used NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-induced trapping of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase with DNA to construct model DNA polymerase substrates containing a DPC in single-stranded template, or in the template strand of double-stranded DNA, or in the non-template (displaced) strand of double-stranded DNA. Nine DNA polymerases belonging to families A, B, X, and Y were studied with respect to their behavior upon encountering a DPC: Klenow fragment of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase I, &lt;i&gt;Thermus aquaticus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase I, &lt;i&gt;Pyrococcus furiosus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase, &lt;i&gt;Sulfolobus solfataricus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase IV, human DNA polymerases β, κ and λ, and DNA polymerases from bacteriophages T4 and RB69. Although none were able to fully bypass DPCs in any context, Family B DNA polymerases (T4, RB69) and Family Y DNA polymerase IV were able to elongate the primer up to the site of the cross-link if a DPC was located in single-stranded template or in the displaced strand. In other cases, DNA synthesis stopped 4–5 nucleotides before the site of the cross-link in single-stranded template or in double-stranded DNA if the polymerases could displace the downstream strand. We suggest that termination of DNA polymerases on a DPC is mostly due to the unrelieved conformational strain experienced by the enzyme when pressing against the cross-linked protein molecule.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>df3ece2d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198480</link><crawled>1527876013672</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf7:3dd877af</id><author><name>Anna V.

Microtubules are dynamic polymers required for a number of processes, including chromosome movement in mitosis. While regulators of microtubule dynamics have been well characterized, we lack a convenient way to predict how the measured dynamic parameters shape the entire microtubule system within a cell, or how the system responds when specific parameters change in response to internal or external signals. Here we describe a Monte Carlo model to simulate an array of dynamic microtubules from parameters including the cell radius, total tubulin concentration, microtubule nucleation rate from the centrosome, and plus end dynamic instability. The algorithm also allows dynamic instability or position of the cell edge to vary during the simulation. Outputs from simulations include free tubulin concentration, average microtubule lengths, length distributions, and individual length changes over time. Using this platform and reported parameters measured in interphase LLCPK1 epithelial cells, we predict that sequestering ~ 15–20% of total tubulin results in fewer microtubules, but promotes dynamic instability of those remaining. Simulations also predict that lowering nucleation rate will increase the stability and average length of the remaining microtubules. Allowing the position of the cell’s edge to vary over time changed the average length but not the number of microtubules and generated length distributions consistent with experimental measurements. Simulating the switch from interphase to prophase demonstrated that decreased rescue frequency at prophase is the critical factor needed to rapidly clear the cell of interphase microtubules prior to mitotic spindle assembly. Finally, consistent with several previous simulations, our results demonstrate that microtubule nucleation and dynamic instability in a confined space determines the partitioning of tubulin between monomer and polymer pools. The model and simulations will be useful for predicting changes to the entire microtubule array after modification to one or more parameters, including predicting the effects of tubulin-targeted chemotherapies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>f3a08dc7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197538</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122e:93d646dc</id><author><name>Lynne Cassimeris</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lynne Cassimeris, Jessica C.

While regulators of microtubule dynamics have been well characterized, we lack a convenient way to predict how the measured dynamic parameters shape the entire microtubule system within a cell, or how the system responds when specific parameters change in response to internal or external signals. Here we describe a Monte Carlo model to simulate an array of dynamic microtubules from parameters including the cell radius, total tubulin concentration, microtubule nucleation rate from the centrosome, and plus end dynamic instability. The algorithm also allows dynamic instability or position of the cell edge to vary during the simulation. Outputs from simulations include free tubulin concentration, average microtubule lengths, length distributions, and individual length changes over time. Using this platform and reported parameters measured in interphase LLCPK1 epithelial cells, we predict that sequestering ~ 15–20% of total tubulin results in fewer microtubules, but promotes dynamic instability of those remaining. Simulations also predict that lowering nucleation rate will increase the stability and average length of the remaining microtubules. Allowing the position of the cell’s edge to vary over time changed the average length but not the number of microtubules and generated length distributions consistent with experimental measurements. Simulating the switch from interphase to prophase demonstrated that decreased rescue frequency at prophase is the critical factor needed to rapidly clear the cell of interphase microtubules prior to mitotic spindle assembly. Finally, consistent with several previous simulations, our results demonstrate that microtubule nucleation and dynamic instability in a confined space determines the partitioning of tubulin between monomer and polymer pools. The model and simulations will be useful for predicting changes to the entire microtubule array after modification to one or more parameters, including predicting the effects of tubulin-targeted chemotherapies.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017935?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Interplay between translational diffusion and large-amplitude angular jumps of water molecules</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017935?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525932024000</published><fingerprint>ca7a8856</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017935?af=R</link><crawled>1526282826472</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1635d8bb2e8:2d2ccc3:3dd877af</id><author><name>Chao Liu</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05213-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Hong Kong builds a science-based future</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05213-x/d41586-018-05213-x_15773832.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05213-x</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hong Kong builds a science-based future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong builds a science-based future, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05213-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05213-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The city is using its proximity to research and development hubs in mainland China to encourage innovation, but barriers to collaboration remain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>78</engagement><published>1527058800000</published><fingerprint>2fd3ab51</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05213-x</link><crawled>1527088744633</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1638d9508b9:7448067:3dd877af</id><author><name>Jack Leeming</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hong Kong builds a science-based future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong builds a science-based future, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05213-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05213-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The city is using its proximity to research and development hubs in mainland China to encourage innovation, but barriers to collaboration remain.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/441/eaap8307?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin><title>[Research Articles] Metarrestin, a perinucleolar compartment inhibitor, effectively suppresses metastasis</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/441/eaap8307.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/441/eaap8307?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Metastasis remains a leading cause of cancer mortality due to the lack of specific inhibitors against this complex process.

Herbivores can modify the rate of shrub and treeline advance. Both direct and indirect effects of herbivory may simultaneously interact to affect the growth rates of plants at this ecotone. We investigated the effect of snowshoe hare herbivory on the height of white spruce at two treeline locations in Alaska, USA. White spruce is expanding its distribution both upwards in elevation and northward in latitude because of climate warming, and snowshoe hares are already present in areas likely to be colonized by spruce. We hypothesized that herbivory would result in browsed individuals having reduced height, suggesting herbivory is a direct, negative effect on spruce treeline advance. We found an interactive effect between browsing history and spruce age. When young (under 30 years old), individuals that were browsed tended to be taller than unbrowsed individuals. However, older seedlings (over 30 years old) that had been browsed were shorter than unbrowsed individuals of the same age. Hares suppress faster growing individuals that are initially taller by preferentially browsing them as they emerge above the winter snowpack. This reduced height, in combination with increased mortality associated with browsing, is predicted to slow the advance of both latitudinal and altitudinal treeline expansions and alter the structure of treeline forests.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>c09e8f8e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198453</link><crawled>1527876013672</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf6:3dd877af</id><author><name>Justin Olnes</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Justin Olnes, Knut Kielland, Hélène Genet, Glenn P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a high throughput technique that measures absorbance of specific wavelengths of light by biological samples and uses this information to classify the age of lab-reared mosquitoes as younger or older than seven days with an average accuracy greater than 80%. For NIRS to estimate ages of wild mosquitoes, a sample of wild mosquitoes with known age in days would be required to train and test the model. Mark-release-recapture is the most reliable method to produce wild-caught mosquitoes of known age in days. However, it is logistically demanding, time inefficient, subject to low recapture rates, and raises ethical issues due to the release of mosquitoes. Using labels from Detinova dissection results in a mathematical model with poor accuracy. Alternatively, a model trained on spectra from laboratory-reared mosquitoes where age in days is known can be applied to estimate the age of wild mosquitoes, but this would be appropriate only if spectra collected from laboratory-reared and wild mosquitoes are similar.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We performed &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-means (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 2) cluster analysis on a mixture of spectra collected from lab-reared and wild &lt;i&gt;Anopheles arabiensis&lt;/i&gt; to determine if there is any significant difference between these two groups.

Treatment of prosthetic joint infections often involves multiple surgeries and prolonged antibiotic administration, resulting in a significant burden to patients and the healthcare system. We are exploring a non-invasive method to eradicate biofilm on metal implants utilizing high-frequency alternating magnetic fields (AMF) which can achieve surface induction heating. Although proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the ability of AMF to eradicate biofilm in vitro, there is a legitimate safety concern related to the potential for thermal damage to surrounding tissues when considering heating implanted metal objects. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting acoustic emissions associated with boiling at the interface between a metal implant and surrounding soft tissue as a wireless safety sensing mechanism. Acoustic emissions generated during in vitro and in vivo AMF exposures were captured with a hydrophone, and the relationship with surface temperature analyzed.

Treatment of prosthetic joint infections often involves multiple surgeries and prolonged antibiotic administration, resulting in a significant burden to patients and the healthcare system. We are exploring a non-invasive method to eradicate biofilm on metal implants utilizing high-frequency alternating magnetic fields (AMF) which can achieve surface induction heating. Although proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the ability of AMF to eradicate biofilm in vitro, there is a legitimate safety concern related to the potential for thermal damage to surrounding tissues when considering heating implanted metal objects. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting acoustic emissions associated with boiling at the interface between a metal implant and surrounding soft tissue as a wireless safety sensing mechanism. Acoustic emissions generated during in vitro and in vivo AMF exposures were captured with a hydrophone, and the relationship with surface temperature analyzed. The effect of AMF exposure power, surrounding media composition, implant location within the AMF transmitter, and implant geometry on acoustic detection during AMF therapy was also evaluated. Acoustic emissions were reliably identified in both tissue-mimicking phantom and mouse studies, and their onset coincided with the implant temperature reaching the boiling threshold. The viscosity of the surrounding medium did not impact the production of acoustic emissions; however, emissions were not present when the medium was oil due to the higher boiling point. Results of simulations and in vivo studies suggest that short-duration, high-power AMF exposures combined with acoustic sensing can be used to minimize the amount of thermal damage in surrounding tissues. These studies support the hypothesis that detection of boiling associated acoustic emissions at a metal/tissue interface could serve as a real-time, wireless safety indicator during AMF treatment of biofilm on metallic implants.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/Cb4Ha3EAn38/acs.jpcb.8b01465</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Effects of Dielectric Inhomogeneity and Electrostatic Correlation on the Solvation Energy of Ions in Liquids</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01465/20180515/images/medium/jp-2018-01465v_0004.gif</url><height>247</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01465</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01465</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01465/20180515/images/medium/jp-2018-01465v_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01465&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, endogenous RNAs that post-transcriptionally repress mRNAs. Over the course of evolution, many new miRNAs are known to have emerged and added to the existing miRNA repertoires of drosophilids and vertebrates. Despite the large number of miRNAs in existence, the complementary pairing of only ~7 bases between miRNAs and mRNAs is sufficient to induce repression. Thus, miRNA targeting is so widespread that genes coexpressed with a miRNA have evolved to avoid sites that are targeted by the miRNA. Besides this avoidance, little is known about the preferential modes of miRNA targeting. Therefore, to elucidate miRNA targeting preference and avoidance, we evaluated the bias of the number of miRNA targeting occurrences in relation to expression intensities of miRNAs and their coexpressed target mRNAs by surveying transcriptome data from human organs. We found that miRNAs preferentially target genes with intermediate levels of expression, while avoiding highly expressed ones, and that older miRNAs have greater targeting specificity, suggesting that specificity increases during the course of evolution.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>d1f8c1dd</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198142</link><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4ec:3dd877af</id><author><name>Hisakazu Iwama</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hisakazu Iwama, Kiyohito Kato, Hitomi Imachi, Koji Murao, Tsutomu Masaki&lt;/p&gt;

Gastric cancer is a malignancy that has a high mortality rate. Although progress has been made in the treatment of gastric cancer, many patients experience cancer recurrence and metastasis. Folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) is overexpressed on the cell surface in over one-third of gastric cancer patients, but rarely is expressed in normal tissue. This makes FOLR1 a potential target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy, although the function of FOLR1 has not been elucidated. CAR are engineered fusion receptor composed of an antigen recognition region and signaling domains. T cells expressing CAR have specific activation and cytotoxic effects against cancer cells containing the target antigen. In this study, we generated a CAR that targets FOLR1 composed of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of FOLR1 antibody and signaling domains consisting of CD28 and CD3ζ. Both FOLR1-CAR KHYG-1, a natural killer cell line, and FOLR1-CAR T cells recognized FOLR1-positive gastric cancer cells in a MHC-independent manner and induced secretion of various cytokines and caused cell death. Conclusively, this is the first study to demonstrate that CAR KHYG-1/T cells targeting FOLR1 are effective against FOLR1-positive gastric cancer cells.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>1b8a2327</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198347</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f50:2835af05</id><author><name>Minsung Kim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Minsung Kim, Suhkneung Pyo, Chung Hyo Kang, Chong Ock Lee, Heung Kyoung Lee, Sang Un Choi, Chi Hoon Park&lt;/p&gt;

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that quantifies the magnetic susceptibility distribution within biological tissues. QSM calculates the underlying magnetic susceptibility by deconvolving the tissue magnetic field map with a unit dipole kernel. However, this deconvolution problem is ill-posed. The morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI) introduces total variation (TV) to regularize the susceptibility reconstruction. However, MEDI results still contain artifacts near tissue boundaries because MEDI only imposes TV constraint on voxels inside smooth regions. We introduce a Morphology-Adaptive TV (MATV) for improving TV-regularized QSM. The MATV method first classifies imaging target into smooth and nonsmooth regions by thresholding magnitude gradients. In the dipole inversion for QSM, the TV regularization weights are a monotonically decreasing function of magnitude gradients. Thus, voxels inside smooth regions are assigned with larger weights than those in nonsmooth regions. Using phantom and in vivo datasets, we compared the performance of MATV with that of MEDI. MATV results had better visual quality than MEDI results, especially near tissue boundaries. Preliminary brain imaging results illustrated that MATV has potential to improve the reconstruction of regions near tissue boundaries.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>ffa7f093</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196922</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475055:2835af05</id><author><name>Li Guo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Li Guo, Yingjie Mei, Jijing Guan, Xiangliang Tan, Yikai Xu, Wufan Chen, Qianjin Feng, Yanqiu Feng&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Globally the number of people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has risen significantly over the last few decades. Aligned to this is a growing use of community health workers (CHWs) to deliver T2DM self-management support with good clinical outcomes especially in High Income Countries (HIC). Evidence and lessons from these interventions can be useful for Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) such as South Africa that are experiencing a marked increase in T2DM prevalence.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to examine how CHW have been utilized to support T2DM self-management globally, their preparation for and supervision to perform their functions.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;The review was guided by a stepwise approach outlined in the framework for scoping reviews developed by Arksey and O’Malley. Peer reviewed scientific and grey literature was searched using a string of keywords, selecting English full-text articles published between 2000 and 2015. Articles were selected using inclusion criteria, charted and content analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1008 studies were identified of which 54 full text articles were selected. Most (53) of the selected studies were in HIC and targeted mostly minority populations in low resource settings. CHWs were mostly deployed to provide education, support, and advocacy. Structured curriculum based education was the most frequently reported service provided by CHWs to support T2DM self-management. Support services included informational, emotional, appraisal and instrumental support. Models of CHW care included facility linked nurse-led CHW coordination, facility-linked CHW led coordination and standalone CHW interventions without facility interaction.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;CHWs play several roles in T2DM self-management, including structured education, ongoing support and health system advocacy.

Preparing and coordinating CHWs for these roles is crucial and needs further research and strengthening.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4161</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId><title>Nature Biotechnology</title></origin><title>Profiling DNA–transcription factor interactions</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>616</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nbt.4161-F1.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4161</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Profiling DNA–transcription factor interactions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiling DNA–transcription factor interactions, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4161&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4161&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Global transcription factor activity is measured by screening cell extracts with an oligonucleotide library.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528268400000</published><fingerprint>5ece6755</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4161</link><crawled>1528302258087</crawled><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_163d5e9c7a7:5e9203d:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Cheen Euong Ang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Profiling DNA–transcription factor interactions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiling DNA–transcription factor interactions, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4161&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4161&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Global transcription factor activity is measured by screening cell extracts with an oligonucleotide library.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/443/eaan4116?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin><title>[Research Articles] A common antimicrobial additive increases colonic inflammation and colitis-associated colon tumorigenesis in mice</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/443/eaan4116.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/443/eaan4116?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Triclosan (TCS) is a high-volume chemical used as an antimicrobial ingredient in more than 2000 consumer products, such as toothpaste, cosmetics, kitchenware, and toys.
