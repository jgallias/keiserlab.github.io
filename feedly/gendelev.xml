Bacterial spot caused by &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas arboricola&lt;/i&gt; pv. &lt;i&gt;pruni&lt;/i&gt; (Xap) is a major threat to &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species worldwide. The molecular mechanisms of peach resistance to Xap during early leaf infection were investigated by RNA-Seq analysis of two &lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt; cultivars, ‘Redkist’ (resistant), and ‘JH Hale’ (susceptible) at 30 minutes, 1 and 3 hours-post-infection (hpi). Both cultivars exhibited extensive modulation of gene expression at 30 mpi, which reduced significantly at 1 hpi, increasing again at 3 hpi. Overall, 714 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in ‘Redkist’ (12% at 30 mpi and 1 hpi and 88% at 3 hpi). In ‘JH Hale’, 821 DEGs were identified (47% at 30 mpi and 1 hpi and 53% at 3 hpi). Highly up-regulated genes (fold change &gt; 100) at 3 hpi exhibited higher fold change values in ‘Redkist’ than in ‘JH Hale’. RNA-Seq bioinformatics analyses were validated by RT-qPCR. In both cultivars, DEGs included genes with putative roles in perception, signal transduction, secondary metabolism, and transcription regulation, and there were defense responses in both cultivars, with enrichment for the gene ontology terms, ‘immune system process’, ‘defense response’, and ‘cell death’. There were particular differences between the cultivars in the intensity and kinetics of modulation of expression of genes with putative roles in transcriptional activity, secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, and receptor and signaling processes. Analysis of differential exon usage (DEU) revealed that both cultivars initiated remodeling their transcriptomes at 30 mpi; however, ‘Redkist’ exhibited alternative exon usage for a greater number of genes at every time point compared with ‘JH Hale’. Candidate resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;WRKY&lt;/i&gt;-like, &lt;i&gt;CRK&lt;/i&gt;-like, &lt;i&gt;Copper amine oxidase&lt;/i&gt;-like, and &lt;i&gt;TIR-NBS-LRR&lt;/i&gt;-like) are of interest for further functional characterization with the aim of elucidating their role in &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; spp. resistance to Xap.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524776400000</updated><fingerprint>d96f538c</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196590</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196590</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196590</originId><author><name>Fabio Gervasi</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524776400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Gervasi, Patrizia Ferrante, Maria Teresa Dettori, Marco Scortichini, Ignazio Verde&lt;/p&gt;

The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen. Importantly, the training-induced change in rs-FC was observed only with the MT+, but not with the dACC or insula. Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>72055f13</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196866</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196866</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196866</originId><author><name>Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi, Ryuta Aoki, Kaho Tsumura, Ruedeerat Keerativittayayut, Koji Jimura, Kiyoshi Nakahara&lt;/p&gt;

A suitable irrigation method adopted to arid desert conditions, including a special soil structure and specialized plants, has been continuously studied and improved. A field study was conducted in the Awei irrigation area of Aletai in Xinjiang in 2015 and 2016 to investigate the applicability of shallow subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI) in an arid desert area. A completely randomized block design with three replications and three treatments for drip tape subsurface depths at 5, 10, 20 cm was established. The results indicated that the vertical distribution of the soil moisture of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI, buried depth at 20 cm) was mainly concentrated at 0–60 cm, while SSDI (buried depth at 5 and 10 cm) was concentrated at 0–30 cm. However, the roots distributions were concentrated at 0–30 cm for SDI and SSDI. The chlorophyll content and water consumption intensity for alfalfa first increased and then decreased in arid desert conditions. The dry yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of SSDI (buried depth at 10 cm) were higher than those of SDI. The SSDI was practical in arid desert conditions and the recommended buried depth was 10 cm.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523653200000</updated><fingerprint>2af7be7</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195965</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195965</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195965</originId><author><name>Shufang Wang</name></author><published>1523653200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shufang Wang, Xiyun Jiao, Weihua Guo, Jian Lu, Yungang Bai, Liping Wang&lt;/p&gt;

This new predictor constitutes an efficient trade-off between accuracy and absence of biases. Some final considerations and suggestions for further improvement of the predictors are discussed.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308239v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Higher expression of miR-133b is associated with better efficacy of erlotinib as the second or third line in non-small cell lung cancer patients</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb0:34f43e70</id><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alessandra Bisagni, Maria Pagano, Sally Maramotti, Francesca Zanelli, Martina Bonacini, Elena Tagliavini, Luca Braglia, Massimiliano Paci, Andrea Mozzarelli, Stefania Croci&lt;/p&gt;
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib) are indicated as first-line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Erlotinib is also used in second and third-line therapy for patients whose tumors have wild type EGFR but to date there are no validated biomarkers useful to identify which patients may benefit from this treatment. The expression level of four miRNAs: miR-133b, -146a, -7 and -21 which target EGFR was investigated by real-time PCR in tumor specimens from NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib administered as the second or third line. We found that miR-133b expression level better discriminated responder from non-responder patients to erlotinib. Higher levels of miR-133b in NSCLCs were associated with longer progression-free survival time of patients. Functional analyses on miR-133b through transfection of a miR-133b mimic in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines indicated that increasing miR-133b expression level led to a decreased cell growth and altered morphology but did not affect sensitivity to erlotinib. The detection of miR-133b expression levels in tumors help in the identification of NSCLC patients with a better prognosis and who are likely to benefit from second and third-line therapy with erlotinib.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524603600000</updated><fingerprint>e142d5ce</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196350</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196350</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196350</originId><author><name>Alessandra Bisagni</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524603600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alessandra Bisagni, Maria Pagano, Sally Maramotti, Francesca Zanelli, Martina Bonacini, Elena Tagliavini, Luca Braglia, Massimiliano Paci, Andrea Mozzarelli, Stefania Croci&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to obtain population norms and to assess test-retest reliability of EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF for the Indonesian population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A representative sample of 1056 people aged 17–75 years was recruited from the Indonesian general population. We used a multistage stratified quota sampling method with respect to residence, gender, age, education level, religion and ethnicity. Respondents completed EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF with help from an interviewer. Norms data for both instruments were reported. For the test-retest evaluations, a sub-sample of 206 respondents completed both instruments twice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The total sample and test-retest sub-sample were representative of the Indonesian general population. The EQ-5D-5L shows almost perfect agreement between the two tests (Gwet’s AC: 0.85–0.99 and percentage agreement: 90–99%) regarding the five dimensions. However, the agreement of EQ-VAS and index scores can be considered as poor (ICC: 0.45 and 0.37 respectively). For the WHOQOL-BREF, ICCs of the four domains were between 0.70 and 0.79, which indicates moderate to good agreement. For EQ-5D-5L, it was shown that female and older respondents had lower EQ-index scores, whilst rural, younger and higher-educated respondents had higher EQ-VAS scores. For WHOQOL-BREF: male, younger, higher-educated, high-income respondents had the highest scores in most of the domains, overall quality of life, and health satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study provides representative estimates of self-reported health status and quality of life for the general Indonesian population as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF instruments. The descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L and the WHOQOL-BREF have high test-retest reliability while the EQ-VAS and the index score of EQ-5D-5L show poor agreement between the two tests.

&lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; is a waterborne parasite that causes diarrheal disease in humans and in cattle. Risk factors for human illness include contact with surface water such as lakes and rivers, exposure to contaminated municipal drinking water, as well as zoonotic transmission from livestock and agriculture. The objectives of this study are twofold: 1) to describe the temporal distribution of cryptosporidiosis in Southwestern Ontario; and 2) to determine the distribution of human cryptosporidiosis, in relation to exposures such as cryptosporidium positive cattle farms, weather events, and hydrological factors. Seasonal trends in 214 bovine and 87 human cases were assessed using regression models that predicted monthly case counts in relation to observed monthly case counts. A case-crossover approach was used to evaluate acute associations between daily environmental exposures, such as weather, hydrology, the presence of &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; positive cattle farms within the region, and the risk of human &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; infection. Annual seasonality was found for both human cases and bovine cases with human cases peaking in mid-summer and bovine cases peaking in late winter to early spring.

&lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; is a waterborne parasite that causes diarrheal disease in humans and in cattle. Risk factors for human illness include contact with surface water such as lakes and rivers, exposure to contaminated municipal drinking water, as well as zoonotic transmission from livestock and agriculture. The objectives of this study are twofold: 1) to describe the temporal distribution of cryptosporidiosis in Southwestern Ontario; and 2) to determine the distribution of human cryptosporidiosis, in relation to exposures such as cryptosporidium positive cattle farms, weather events, and hydrological factors. Seasonal trends in 214 bovine and 87 human cases were assessed using regression models that predicted monthly case counts in relation to observed monthly case counts. A case-crossover approach was used to evaluate acute associations between daily environmental exposures, such as weather, hydrology, the presence of &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; positive cattle farms within the region, and the risk of human &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; infection. Annual seasonality was found for both human cases and bovine cases with human cases peaking in mid-summer and bovine cases peaking in late winter to early spring. Bovine cases that occurred 21 days prior to human cases were associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of human case occurrence. At both 9 and 14 days prior to human case onset, the odds of a human case increased twofold per 10-degree Celsius increase in air temperature. These results provide a preliminary hypothesis for the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis from cattle to humans via the environment and suggest that the timing of environmental conditions in relation to case occurrence is biologically plausible.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196573</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Widespread plant specialization in the polyphagous planthopper &amp;lt;i&gt;Hyalesthes obsoletus&amp;lt;/i&gt; (Cixiidae), a major vector of stolbur phytoplasma: Evidence of cryptic speciation</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47505d:2835af05</id><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Kosovac, Jes Johannesen, Oliver Krstić, Milana Mitrović, Tatjana Cvrković, Ivo Toševski, Jelena Jović&lt;/p&gt;
The stolbur phytoplasma vector &lt;i&gt;Hyalesthes obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; is generally considered as a polyphagous species associated with numerous wild and cultivated plants. However, recent research in southeastern Europe, the distribution centre of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; and the area of most stolbur-inflicted crop diseases, points toward specific host-plant associations of the vector, indicating specific vector-based transmission routes. Here, we study the specificity of populations associated with four host-plants using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers, and we evaluate the evolution of host-shifts in &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt;.

It is expected that cell replacement therapies using autologous cells would forego the need for immunosuppression, otherwise required in allogeneic transplantations. However, recent studies have shown the unexpected immune rejection of undifferentiated autologous mouse iPSCs after transplantation. Whether similar immunogenic properties are maintained in iPSC-derived lineage-committed cells (such as neural precursors) is relatively unknown. We demonstrate that syngeneic porcine iPSC-derived neural precursor cell (NPC) transplantation to the spinal cord in the absence of immunosuppression is associated with long-term survival and neuronal and glial differentiation.

It is expected that cell replacement therapies using autologous cells would forego the need for immunosuppression, otherwise required in allogeneic transplantations. However, recent studies have shown the unexpected immune rejection of undifferentiated autologous mouse iPSCs after transplantation. Whether similar immunogenic properties are maintained in iPSC-derived lineage-committed cells (such as neural precursors) is relatively unknown. We demonstrate that syngeneic porcine iPSC-derived neural precursor cell (NPC) transplantation to the spinal cord in the absence of immunosuppression is associated with long-term survival and neuronal and glial differentiation. No tumor formation was noted. Similar cell engraftment and differentiation were shown in spinally injured transiently immunosuppressed swine leukocyte antigen (SLA)–mismatched allogeneic pigs. These data demonstrate that iPSC-NPCs can be grafted into syngeneic recipients in the absence of immunosuppression and that temporary immunosuppression is sufficient to induce long-term immune tolerance after NPC engraftment into spinally injured allogeneic recipients.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several patients with Parkinson´s disease (PD) can walk normally along straight trajectories, and impairment in their stride length and cadence may not be easily discernible. Do obvious abnormalities occur in these high-functioning patients when more challenging trajectories are travelled, such as circular paths, which normally implicate a graded modulation in the duration of the interlimb gait cycle phases?&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We compared a cohort of well-treated mildly to moderately affected PD patients to a group of age-matched healthy subjects (HS), by deliberately including HS spontaneously walking at the same speed of the patients with PD. All participants performed, in random order: linear and circular walking (clockwise and counter-clockwise) at self-selected speed. By means of pressure-sensitive insoles, we recorded walking speed, cadence, duration of single support, double support, swing phase, and stride time. Stride length-cadence relationships were built for linear and curved walking. Stride-to-stride variability of temporal gait parameters was also estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Walking speed, cadence or stride length were not different between PD and HS during linear walking. Speed, cadence and stride length diminished during curved walking in both groups, stride length more in PD than HS. In PD compared to HS, the stride length-cadence relationship was altered during curved walking. Duration of the double-support phase was also increased during curved walking, as was variability of the single support, swing phase and double support phase.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The spatio-temporal gait pattern and variability are significantly modified in well-treated, high-functioning patients with PD walking along circular trajectories, even when they exhibit no changes in speed in straight-line walking. The increased variability of the gait phases during curved walking is an identifying characteristic of PD.

In human sleep studies, the probability of discomfort from the electrodes and the change in environment usually results in first-night recordings being discarded. Sleep recordings from the first night in human subjects often differ in amount of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and the overall sleep architecture. This study investigated whether recordings of sleep states in dairy cows also show a first-night effect. Non-invasive electrophysiological recordings were carried out on nine cows of the Swedish Red breed during three consecutive 24-hour periods (recording days 1–3). Overall, cows spent 12.9 ± 1.4 hours awake, 8.2 ± 1 hours ruminating, 57.2 ± 20.3 min drowsing, 44.1 ± 20.2 min in REM sleep and 64.3 ± 38.1 min in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (mean ± SD) and there were no significant differences between recording days in total duration for any of the sleep and awake states. However, the bouts of REM sleep and rumination were longer, and the awake bouts were shorter, at night time compared to daytime, regardless of recording day. The awake bouts also showed an interaction effect with longer bouts at daytime during day 1 compared to daytime on day 3. Data on sleep and awake states recorded in adult dairy cows during three consecutive 24-h periods showed great variation in sleep time between cows, but total time for each state was not significantly affected by recording day.

Cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reflects cerebral perfusion and tissue oxygen consumption, which decline in some patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or stroke, especially during exercise. Its physiologic basis and clinical significance remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the association of SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with oxygen transport physiology and known prognostic factors during both rest and exercise in patients with HFrEF or stroke. Thirty-four HFrEF patients, 26 stroke patients, and 17 healthy controls performed an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test using a bicycle ergometer. Integrated near-infrared spectroscopy and automatic gas analysis were used to measure cerebral tissue oxygenation and cardiac and ventilatory parameters. We found that SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (rest; peak) were significantly lower in the HFrEF (66.3±13.3%; 63.4±13.8%,) than in the stroke (72.1±4.2%; 72.7±4.5%) and control (73.1±2.8%; 72±3.2%) groups. In the HFrEF group, SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at rest (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt;) and peak SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;) were linearly correlated with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), peak oxygen consumption (V˙O2peak), and oxygen uptake efficiency slope (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; between -0.561 and 0.677, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Stepwise linear regression showed that SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt; was determined by partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide at rest (P&lt;sub&gt;ET&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt;), hemoglobin, and mean arterial pressure at rest (MAP&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;) (adjusted R = 0.681, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; was mainly affected by peak carbon dioxide production (V˙CO2peak) (adjusted R = 0.653, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) in patients with HFrEF. In conclusion, the study delineates the relationship of cerebral saturation and parameters associated with oxygen delivery.

The necrophilous insect fauna on carcasses varies seasonally and geographically. The ecological succession of insects arriving to decaying neonate pig carcasses in central North Carolina during late summer was sampled using a novel vented-chamber collection method. We collected six blow fly species, flesh flies, house flies and 10 beetle taxa, including four species of scarab beetles. Necrophilous fly activity dominated the early decomposition stages, whereas beetle numbers remained low until day 4. By day 7, more than 50% of the pig carcasses were skeletonized and they attracted few insects. Differences in the taxa and successional patterns documented in this experiment and a previous study in the same location highlight the ecological variation in such investigations, and underscore the need for standardization, as well as for ecological succession studies on finer geographic scales.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><fingerprint>a27e7783</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195785</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195785</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195785</originId><author><name>Angela Cruise</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1523566800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Angela Cruise, David W.

Dimensionality reduction of microarray data is a very challenging task due to high computational time and the large amount of memory required to train and test a model. Genetic programming (GP) is a stochastic approach to solving a problem. For high dimensional datasets, GP does not perform as well as other machine learning algorithms. To explore the inherent property of GP to generalize models from low dimensional data, we need to consider dimensionality reduction approaches. Random projections (RPs) have gained attention for reducing the dimensionality of data with reduced computational cost, compared to other dimensionality reduction approaches. We report that the features constructed from RPs perform extremely well when combined with a GP approach. We used eight datasets out of which seven have not been reported as being used in any machine learning research before. We have also compared our results by using the same full and constructed features for decision trees, random forest, naive Bayes, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbor methods.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524862800000</updated><fingerprint>e50de4c0</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196385</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196385</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196385</originId><author><name>Hassan Tariq</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524862800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hassan Tariq, Elf Eldridge, Ian Welch&lt;/p&gt;

Intralesional (IL) injection of Rose Bengal (PV-10) induces regression of injected and uninjected lesions in several murine tumor models. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor response of combining IL PV-10 with blockade of the PD-1 / PD-L1 pathway and the role of immune cell populations in eliciting this response. To investigate the role of T cell subsets in mediating an immune response, B16 or M05 melanoma-bearing mice received combination therapy as well as CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; depleting antibodies. Tumor growth was measured. T cells were collected from spleens or tumors, and phenotype, activation markers, and reactivity were measured. Splenocytes from mice treated with combination therapy had increased OVA antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in M05-tumor-bearing mice. Depletion of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells or regulatory T cells (Tregs) in combination with IL PV-10 and anti-PD-1 antibody treatment resulted in an enhanced anti-tumor effect. Treatment with CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; depleting antibody abrogated anti-tumor immunity.

Background &lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorders (AUD) in older people have been the subject of increasing interest in Europe and worldwide. However, thus far, no reliable data exist regarding the prevalence of AUD in people over the age of 65 years in Europe.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the current (past month), 12-month and lifetime prevalence of alcohol use, abuse and dependence in people aged 65–84 years.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;The MentDis_ICF65+ study was a representative stepwise cross-sectional survey that was conducted in six European and associated cities (Hamburg, Germany; Ferrara, Italy; London/Canterbury, England; Madrid, Spain; Geneva, Switzerland and Jerusalem, Israel).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;In total, 3,142 community-dwelling people aged between 65 and 84 years who lived in participating cities were assessed with an age-sensitive diagnostic interview (CIDI65+).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of lifetime alcohol use was 81% for the overall sample. The observed AUD (DSM-IV-TR) prevalence was as follows: current, 1.1%; 12-month, 5.3% and lifetime, 8.8%. Alcohol consumption and AUD were more prevalent in males, and a significant interaction between gender and city was observed; greater gender differences in the prevalence of these disorders were observed in Hamburg, London/Canterbury and Geneva in comparison to the other cities. The prevalence of lifetime alcohol consumption and 12-month AUD tended to be lower in older persons.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results highlight the appropriateness of using age-adjusted diagnostic tools (CIDI65+) to identify alcohol use and AUD in older people.

Background &lt;p&gt;Radiotherapy is increasingly used to treat oligometastatic patients. We sought to identify prognostic criteria in oligometastatic patients undergoing definitive hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exclusively extracranial&lt;/i&gt; oligometastatic patients treated with HIGRT were pooled. Characteristics including age, sex, primary tumor type, interval to metastatic diagnosis, number of treated metastases and organs, metastatic site, prior systemic therapy for primary tumor treatment, prior definitive metastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy for metastasis associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treated metastasis control (TMC) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards method. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) identified prognostic risk strata for OS and PFS based on pretreatment factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;361 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung (17%), colorectal (19%), and breast cancer (16%). Three-year OS was 56%, PFS was 24%, and TMC was 72%. On multivariate analysis, primary tumor, interval to metastases, treated metastases number, and mediastinal/hilar lymph node, liver, or adrenal metastases were associated with OS. Primary tumor site, involved organ number, liver metastasis, and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with PFS.OS RPA identified five classes: class 1: all breast, kidney, or prostate cancer patients (BKP) (3-year OS 75%, 95% CI 66–85%); class 2: patients without BKP with disease-free interval of 75+ months (3-year OS 85%, 95% CI 67–100%); class 3: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≤ two metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 55%, 95% CI 48–64%); class 4: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≥ three metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 38%, 95% CI 24–60%); class 5: all others (3-year OS 13%, 95% CI 5–35%).

Dairy farming is one the most important sectors of United Kingdom (UK) agriculture. It faces major challenges due to climate change, which will have direct impacts on dairy cows as a result of heat stress. In the absence of adaptations, this could potentially lead to considerable milk loss. Using an 11-member climate projection ensemble, as well as an ensemble of 18 milk loss estimation methods, temporal changes in milk production of UK dairy cows were estimated for the 21st century at a 25 km resolution in a spatially-explicit way. While increases in UK temperatures are projected to lead to relatively low average annual milk losses, even for southern UK regions (&amp;lt;180 kg/cow), the ‘hottest’ 25×25 km grid cell in the hottest year in the 2090s, showed an annual milk loss exceeding 1300 kg/cow. This figure represents approximately 17% of the potential milk production of today’s average cow. Despite the potential considerable inter-annual variability of annual milk loss, as well as the large differences between the climate projections, the variety of calculation methods is likely to introduce even greater uncertainty into milk loss estimations. To address this issue, a novel, more biologically-appropriate mechanism of estimating milk loss is proposed that provides more realistic future projections. We conclude that South West England is the region most vulnerable to climate change economically, because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore potentially high heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach £13.4M in average years and £33.8M in extreme years.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>9c3875be</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197076</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197076</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197076</originId><author><name>Nándor Fodor</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nándor Fodor, Andreas Foskolos, Cairistiona F.

Although studies from pediatric cancers (largely acute lymphoblastic leukemia) have shown that patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy may experience decreased growth velocity during the treatment phase, no such data exist for retinoblastoma patients treated with systemic chemotherapy or ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC). The purpose of this study is to report growth patterns of our retinoblastoma (Rb) population who were treated with OAC in a retrospective, single center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) review of 341 patients treated between 2006 and 2016. Children who only received OAC were classified as naive; those who were treated initially with systemic chemotherapy and subsequently presented to our center for OAC were termed secondary; and a small group of patients who received single-agent systemic chemotherapy prior to OAC were labeled bridge. For all patients, height and weight were recorded at monthly intervals during OAC (short-term) and then annually during a follow-up period (long-term) up to 3 years after treatment. Excluded from this study were children who received external radiation therapy and those with genetic syndromes, which are independently associated with growth derangements. During OAC, there was no significant difference in growth velocity between the naïve and secondary groups. In either group, number of treatments also did not affect growth rate. Three years after the end of OAC, naïve patients were in the 68&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile by height (95% CI 61.30, 74.63) compared to secondary patients in the 61&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 51.1, 71.47). Both groups were in the same weight percentiles during the first two years of follow-up but at the three-year follow-up period, naïve patients were in the 63&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 57.4, 69.4) and secondary patients were in the 60&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 50.4, 69.7). OAC for retinoblastoma does not appear to impact short-term growth velocity, weight gain during the treatment period or after three years.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><fingerprint>ebe29cd1</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197052</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197052</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197052</originId><author><name>Sruti S.

Like other tissues, skin is subject to temporal fluctuations in physiological responses under both homeostatic and stressed states. To gain insight into these fluctuations, we investigated the role of the circadian clock in the transcriptional regulation of epidermis using a hybrid experimental design, where a limited set of human subjects (n=20) were sampled throughout the 24 h cycle and a larger population (n=219) were sampled once. By looking at pairwise correlations of core clock genes in 298 skin samples, we found a robust circadian oscillator in skin at the population level. Encouraged by this, we used CYCLOPS to reconstruct the temporal order of all samples and identified hundreds of rhythmically-expressed genes at the population level in human skin. We compared these results with published time-series skin data from mouse and show strong concordance in circadian phase across species for both transcripts and pathways. Further, like blood, skin is readily accessible and a potential source of biomarkers. Using ZeitZeiger, we identified a biomarker set for human skin that is capable of reporting circadian phase to within 3 h from a single sample.

To gain insight into these fluctuations, we investigated the role of the circadian clock in the transcriptional regulation of epidermis using a hybrid experimental design, where a limited set of human subjects (n=20) were sampled throughout the 24 h cycle and a larger population (n=219) were sampled once. By looking at pairwise correlations of core clock genes in 298 skin samples, we found a robust circadian oscillator in skin at the population level. Encouraged by this, we used CYCLOPS to reconstruct the temporal order of all samples and identified hundreds of rhythmically-expressed genes at the population level in human skin. We compared these results with published time-series skin data from mouse and show strong concordance in circadian phase across species for both transcripts and pathways. Further, like blood, skin is readily accessible and a potential source of biomarkers. Using ZeitZeiger, we identified a biomarker set for human skin that is capable of reporting circadian phase to within 3 h from a single sample. In summary, we show rhythms in human skin that persist at the population scale and a path to develop robust single-sample circadian biomarkers.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301820v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/19.cover-source.jpg?itok=gY78Iz1p</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>359</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>480</height></visual><title>The Matthew effect in science funding [Social Sciences]</title><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16341385bca:5412e7:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525807602634</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>A classic thesis is that scientific achievement exhibits a “Matthew effect”: Scientists who have previously been successful are more likely to succeed again, producing increasing distinction.

Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-protein complexes in a number of bacterial pathogens that can translocate proteins and DNA to the host. Most T4SSs function in conjugation and translocate DNA; however, approximately 13% function to secrete proteins, delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. Upon entry, these effectors manipulate the host cell’s machinery for their own benefit, which can result in serious illness or death of the host. For this reason recognition of T4SS effectors has become an important subject. Much previous work has focused on verifying effectors experimentally, a costly endeavor in terms of money, time, and effort. Having good predictions for effectors will help to focus experimental validations and decrease testing costs. In recent years, several scoring and machine learning-based methods have been suggested for the purpose of predicting T4SS effector proteins. These methods have used different sets of features for prediction, and their predictions have been inconsistent. In this paper, an optimal set of features is presented for predicting T4SS effector proteins using a statistical approach. A thorough literature search was performed to find features that have been proposed. Feature values were calculated for datasets of known effectors and non-effectors for T4SS-containing pathogens for four genera with a sufficient number of known effectors, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp, and &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. The features were ranked, and less important features were filtered out. Correlations between remaining features were removed, and dimensional reduction was accomplished using principal component analysis and factor analysis. Finally, the optimal features for each pathogen were chosen by building logistic regression models and evaluating each model. The results based on evaluation of our logistic regression models confirm the effectiveness of our four optimal sets of features, and based on these an optimal set of features is proposed for all T4SS effector proteins.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>f6131981</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</originId><author><name>Zhila Esna Ashari</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhila Esna Ashari, Nairanjana Dasgupta, Kelly A.

Adult male C57BL/6J mice have previously been reported to have motor and memory deficits after experimental closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI), without associated gross pathologic damage or neuroimaging changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging protocols. The presence of neurologic deficits, however, suggests neural damage or dysfunction in these animals. Accordingly, we undertook a histologic analysis of mice after TBI. Gross pathology and histologic analysis using Nissl stain and NeuN immunohistochemistry demonstrated no obvious tissue damage or neuron loss. However, Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed myelin injury in the optic tract, while Fluoro Jade B and silver degeneration staining revealed evidence of axonal neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and superior colliculus (detectable at 7 days, but not 24 hours, after injury). Fluoro Jade B staining was not detectable in other white matter tracts, brain regions or in cell somata. In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>27565fc4</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197346</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197346</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197346</originId><author><name>Nathan K.

Many important applications continuously generate data, such as financial transaction administration, satellite monitoring, network flow monitoring, and web information processing. The data mining results are always evolving with the newly generated data. Obviously, for the clustering task, it is better to incrementally update the new clustering results based on the old data rather than to recluster all of the data from scratch. The incremental clustering approach is an essential way to solve the problem of clustering with growing Big Data. This paper proposes a boundary-profile-based incremental clustering (BPIC) method to find arbitrarily shaped clusters with dynamically growing datasets. This method represents the existing clustering results with a collection of boundary profiles and discards the inner points of clusters rather than keep all data. It greatly saves both time and space storage costs. To identify the boundary profile, this paper presents a boundary-vector-based boundary point detection (BV-BPD) algorithm that summarizes the structure of the existing clusters. The BPIC method processes each new point in an online fashion and updates the clustering results in a batch mode. When a new point arrives, the BPIC method either immediately labels it or temporarily puts it into a bucket according to the relationship between the new data and the boundary profiles. A bucket is employed to distinguish the noise from the potential seeds of new clusters and alleviate the effects of data order. When the bucket is full, the BPIC method will cluster the data within it and update the clustering results. Thus, the BPIC method is insensitive to noise and the order of new data, which is critical for the robustness of the incremental clustering process.

Many important applications continuously generate data, such as financial transaction administration, satellite monitoring, network flow monitoring, and web information processing. The data mining results are always evolving with the newly generated data. Obviously, for the clustering task, it is better to incrementally update the new clustering results based on the old data rather than to recluster all of the data from scratch. The incremental clustering approach is an essential way to solve the problem of clustering with growing Big Data. This paper proposes a boundary-profile-based incremental clustering (BPIC) method to find arbitrarily shaped clusters with dynamically growing datasets. This method represents the existing clustering results with a collection of boundary profiles and discards the inner points of clusters rather than keep all data. It greatly saves both time and space storage costs. To identify the boundary profile, this paper presents a boundary-vector-based boundary point detection (BV-BPD) algorithm that summarizes the structure of the existing clusters. The BPIC method processes each new point in an online fashion and updates the clustering results in a batch mode. When a new point arrives, the BPIC method either immediately labels it or temporarily puts it into a bucket according to the relationship between the new data and the boundary profiles. A bucket is employed to distinguish the noise from the potential seeds of new clusters and alleviate the effects of data order. When the bucket is full, the BPIC method will cluster the data within it and update the clustering results. Thus, the BPIC method is insensitive to noise and the order of new data, which is critical for the robustness of the incremental clustering process. In the experiments, the performance of the boundary point detection algorithm BV-BPD is compared with the state-of-the-art method. The results show that the BV-BPD is better than the state-of-the-art method. Additionally, the performance of BPIC and other two incremental clustering methods are investigated in terms of clustering quality, time and space efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the BPIC method is able to get a qualified clustering result on a large dataset with higher time and space efficiency.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196108</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Resolving the neutron lifetime puzzle</title><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7e9:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>cbed5aee</fingerprint><keywords><item>Physics</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/605.full</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/605?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/605?rss=1</originId><author><name>Mumm, P.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525974002000</published><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/605?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/444?rss=1</originId><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1630325226e:3dd916:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1524766155374</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Mitigating global infectious disease requires diagnostic tools that are sensitive, specific, and rapidly field deployable.

Tobacco (&lt;i&gt;Nicotiana tabacum&lt;/i&gt;) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent protein kinase 1 (NtCDPK1) is involved in feedback regulation of the plant hormone gibberellin through the phosphorylation of the transcription factor, REPRESSION OF SHOOT GROWTH (RSG). Previously, Ser-6 and Thr-21 were identified as autophosphorylation sites in NtCDPK1. Autophosphorylation of Ser-6 and Thr-21 not only decreases the binding affinity of NtCDPK1 for RSG, but also inhibits the homodimerization of NtCDPK1. Furthermore, autophosphorylation decreases the phosphorylation efficiency of RSG. We demonstrated that Ser-6 and Thr-21 of NtCDPK1 are phosphorylated in response to GAs in plants. The substitution of these autophosphorylation sites with Ala enhances the NtCDPK1 overexpression-induced sensitization of seeds to a GA biosynthetic inhibitor during germination. These findings suggested that autophosphorylation of Ser-6 and Thr-21 prevents excessive phosphorylation of RSG. In this study, we attempted to determine which autophosphorylation site is responsible for the functional regulation of NtCDPK1. Ser-6 was autophosphorylated within 1 min, whereas Thr-21 required over 5 min to be completely autophosphorylated. Furthermore, we found that Ser-6 and Thr-21 were autophosphorylated by inter- and intramolecular mechanisms, respectively, which may be reflected in the faster autophosphorylation of Ser-6. Although both autophosphorylation sites were involved in the reduction of the binding affinity of NtCDPK1 for RSG and the inhibition of NtCDPK1 homodimerization, autophosphorylation of Ser-6 alone was sufficient to decrease the kinase activity of NtCDPK1 for RSG. These results suggest that autophosphorylation of Ser-6 is important for the rapid reduction of NtCDPK1 kinase activity for RSG, whereas that of Thr-21 may play an auxiliary role.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><fingerprint>55182d9d</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196357</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196357</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196357</originId><author><name>Takeshi Ito</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524517200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takeshi Ito, Sarahmi Ishida, Yohsuke Takahashi&lt;/p&gt;

Natural forests in inland China are generally distributed in montane area and secondary due to a semi-arid climate and past anthropogenic disturbances. However, quantification of carbon (C) stock in these forests and the role of altitude in determining C storage and its partition among ecosystem components are unclear. We sampled 54 stands of three secondary coniferous forests (&lt;i&gt;Larix principis-rupprechtii&lt;/i&gt; (LP) forest, &lt;i&gt;Picea meyerii&lt;/i&gt; (PM) forest and &lt;i&gt;Pinus tabulaeformis&lt;/i&gt; (PT) forest) on Loess Plateau in an altitudinal range of 1200-2700m a.s.l. C stocks of tree layer, shrub layer, herb layer, coarse wood debris, forest floor and soil were estimated. We found these forests had relatively high total C stocks. Driven by both higher vegetation and soil C stocks, total C stocks of LP and PM forests in the high altitudinal range were 375.0 and 368.4 t C ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, significantly higher than that of PT forest in the low altitudinal range (230.2 t C ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, understory shrubs accounted for about 20% of total biomass in PT forest. The proportions of vegetation to total C stock were similar among in the three forests (below 45%), so were the proportions of soil C stock (over 54%). Necromass C stocks were also similar among these forests, but their proportions to total C stock were significantly lower in LP and PM forests (1.4% and 1.6%) than in PT forest (3.0%). Across forest types, vegetation biomass and soil C stock simultaneously increased with increasing altitude, causing fairly unchanged C partitioning among ecosystem components along the altitudinal gradient. Soil C stock also increased with altitude in LP and PT forests. Forest floor necromass decreased with increasing altitude across the three forests. Our results suggest the important role of the altitudinal gradient in C sequestration and floor necromass of these three forests in terms of alleviated water conditions and in soil C storage of LP and PM forests in terms of temperature change.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><fingerprint>8e5750fa</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196927</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196927</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196927</originId><author><name>Ning Liu</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525381200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ning Liu, Hongwei Nan&lt;/p&gt;

Biofilms are microbial collectives that occupy a diverse array of surfaces. It is well known that the function and evolution of biofilms are strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of different strains and species within them, but how spatiotemporal distributions of different genotypes in biofilm populations originate is still underexplored. Here, we study the origins of biofilm genetic structure by combining model development, numerical simulations, and microfluidic experiments using the human pathogen &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt;. Using spatial correlation functions to quantify the differences between emergent cell lineage segregation patterns, we find that strong adhesion often, but not always, maximizes the size of clonal cell clusters on flat surfaces. Counterintuitively, our model predicts that, under some conditions, investing in adhesion can reduce rather than increase clonal group size. Our results emphasize that a complex interaction between fluid flow and cell adhesiveness can underlie emergent patterns of biofilm genetic structure. This structure, in turn, has an outsize influence on how biofilm-dwelling populations function and evolve.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-LcIezdmCHM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><fingerprint>a2273f75</fingerprint><engagement>1</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006094</link><title>Cell adhesion and fluid flow jointly initiate genotype spatial distribution in biofilms</title><author><name>Ricardo Martínez-García</name></author><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006094</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1523912400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ricardo Martínez-García, Carey D.

Mercury (Hg) is deposited from the atmosphere to remote areas such as forests, but the amount of Hg in trees is not well known. To determine the importance of Hg in trees, we analyzed foliage, bark and bole wood of eight tree species at four sites in the northeastern USA (Huntington Forest, NY; Sleepers River, VT; Hubbard Brook, NH; Bear Brook, ME). Foliar concentrations of Hg averaged 16.3 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; among the hardwood species, which was significantly lower than values in conifers, which averaged 28.6 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Similarly, bark concentrations of Hg were lower (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) in hardwoods (7.7 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) than conifers (22.5 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). For wood, concentrations of Hg were higher in yellow birch (2.1–2.8 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and white pine (2.3 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) than in the other species, which averaged 1.4 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Sites differed significantly in Hg concentrations of foliage and bark (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), which are directly exposed to the atmosphere, but the concentration of Hg in wood depended more on species (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) than site (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.60). The Hg contents of tree tissues in hardwood stands, estimated from modeled biomass and measured concentrations at each site, were higher in bark (mean of 0.10 g ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and wood (0.16 g ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) than in foliage (0.06 g ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). In conifer stands, because foliar concentrations were higher, the foliar pool tended to be more important.

Quantifying Hg in tree tissues is essential to understanding the pools and fluxes of Hg in forest ecosystems.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196293</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04874-y/d41586-018-04874-y_15713350.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height></visual><title>US government considers charging for popular Earth-observing data</title><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162f807aeb7:692544e:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1524579675831</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;US government considers charging for popular Earth-observing data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US government considers charging for popular Earth-observing data, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04874-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04874-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;I﻿mages from Landsat satellites and agricultural-survey programme are freely available to scientists — but for how long?</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>298d8599</fingerprint><engagement>1209</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04874-y</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04874-y</originId><author><name>Gabriel Popkin</name></author><published>1524553200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;US government considers charging for popular Earth-observing data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US government considers charging for popular Earth-observing data, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04874-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04874-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;I﻿mages from Landsat satellites and agricultural-survey programme are freely available to scientists — but for how long?</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04874-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00291/20180509/images/medium/cb-2018-00291a_0007.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>127</height></visual><title>[ASAP] Calcium-Mediated Allostery of the EGF Fold</title><id>ofNPcmQ46PpGzt1nO49W9STAvkUsM7jssLxNXMp09ME=_16345c2dc84:1b2860a:abeb7260</id><crawled>1525883788420</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>a7de584e</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00291/20180509/images/medium/cb-2018-00291a_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00291&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) induces a systemic inflammatory state affecting iron homeostasis. Patients with TB often have additional comorbidities such as anemia which can result in poorer treat outcomes. We studied the contribution of anemia and the role of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin among TB patients and household contacts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed serum samples from 102 TB cases and 98 controls without TB, matched by age/sex, for hepcidin, iron, and inflammation parameters. Five controls developed TB within 12 months. We used linear regression to assess associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) was more frequent among cases than controls (59.8% vs. 26.1%), but iron-deficiency anemia more frequent in controls (10% vs. 1%). The median hepcidin level was higher in cases than controls (63.7 vs. 14.2 ng/mL), but coinfections with HIV, helminths, and respiratory pathogens did not show cumulative effects. Hepcidin was associated with more severe TB symptom scoring (coefficient 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5–1.2) and higher mycobacterial load (0.7, 95% CI 0.4–1.0).

Background &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) induces a systemic inflammatory state affecting iron homeostasis. Patients with TB often have additional comorbidities such as anemia which can result in poorer treat outcomes. We studied the contribution of anemia and the role of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin among TB patients and household contacts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed serum samples from 102 TB cases and 98 controls without TB, matched by age/sex, for hepcidin, iron, and inflammation parameters. Five controls developed TB within 12 months. We used linear regression to assess associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) was more frequent among cases than controls (59.8% vs. 26.1%), but iron-deficiency anemia more frequent in controls (10% vs. 1%). The median hepcidin level was higher in cases than controls (63.7 vs. 14.2 ng/mL), but coinfections with HIV, helminths, and respiratory pathogens did not show cumulative effects. Hepcidin was associated with more severe TB symptom scoring (coefficient 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5–1.2) and higher mycobacterial load (0.7, 95% CI 0.4–1.0). Hepcidin was higher in TB cases and controls who developed TB compared to controls without TB (p&amp;lt;0.001), even when restricting to HIV-negative study participants.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;ACD was the predominate etiology in TB patients suggesting limited benefit from iron supplementation. Increased hepcidin levels long before active disease, indicating altered iron metabolism, may be a marker for developing disease among TB-exposed individuals. Clinical management of anemia and nutrition interventions in TB patients need to be considered to improve the clinical course and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195985</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Reproducible genomics analysis pipelines with GNU Guix [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162b426e2a6:48cd54:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523440870054</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>In bioinformatics as well as other compute heavy research fields, there is a need for workflows that can be relied upon to produce consistent output, independent of the software environment or configuration settings of the machine on which they are executed.

Monoamines and neuropeptides often modulate the same behavior, but monoaminergic-peptidergic crosstalk remains poorly understood. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, the adrenergic-like ligands, tyramine (TA) and octopamine (OA) require distinct subsets of neuropeptides in the two ASI sensory neurons to inhibit nociception. TA selectively increases the release of ASI neuropeptides encoded by &lt;i&gt;nlp-14&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;nlp-18&lt;/i&gt; from either synaptic/perisynaptic regions of ASI axons or the ASI soma, respectively, and OA selectively increases the release of ASI neuropeptides encoded by &lt;i&gt;nlp-9&lt;/i&gt; asymmetrically, from only the synaptic/perisynaptic region of the right ASI axon. The predicted amino acid preprosequences of genes encoding either TA- or OA-dependent neuropeptides differed markedly. However, these distinct preprosequences were not sufficient to confer monoamine-specificity and additional N-terminal peptide-encoding sequence was required. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TA and OA specifically and differentially modulate the release of distinct subsets of neuropeptides from different subcellular sites within the ASIs, highlighting the complexity of monoaminergic/peptidergic modulation, even in animals with a relatively simple nervous system.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><fingerprint>6e03ce43</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196954</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196954</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196954</originId><author><name>Tobias Clark</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525381200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias Clark, Vera Hapiak, Mitchell Oakes, Holly Mills, Richard Komuniecki&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, effective treatment of infections caused by &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; has become challenging due to the ability of the bacterium to acquire or up-regulate antimicrobial resistance determinants. Two component signal transduction systems are known to regulate expression of virulence factors including multidrug efflux pumps. Here, we investigated the role of the AdeRS two component signal transduction system in regulating the AdeAB efflux system, determined whether AdeA and/or AdeB can individually confer antimicrobial resistance, and explored the interplay between pentamidine resistance and growth conditions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 17978. Results identified that deletion of &lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; affected resistance towards chlorhexidine and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, two previously defined AdeABC substrates, and also identified an 8-fold decrease in resistance to pentamidine. Examination of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt;, Δ&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and Δ&lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; cells augmented results seen for Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; and identified a set of dicationic AdeAB substrates. RNA-sequencing of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; revealed transcription of 290 genes were ≥2-fold altered compared to the wildtype. Pentamidine shock significantly increased &lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt; expression in the wildtype, but decreased it in Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt;, implying that AdeRS activates &lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; transcription in ATCC 17978. Investigation under multiple growth conditions, including the use of Biolog phenotypic microarrays, revealed resistance to pentamidine in ATCC 17978 and mutants could be altered by bioavailability of iron or utilization of different carbon sources. In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that AdeAB in ATCC 17978 can confer intrinsic resistance to a subset of dicationic compounds and in particular, resistance to pentamidine can be significantly altered depending on the growth conditions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>3be07326</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197412</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197412</originId><author><name>Felise G.

This research identifies which shots types in goalball are most likely to lead to a goal and herby provides background information for improving training and competition. Therefore, we observed 117 elite level matches including 20,541 shots played in the regular situation (3 vs. 3) using notational analysis. We characterized the shots by using their target sector (A-E), technique (traditional, rotation), trajectory (flat, bounce), angle (straight, diagonal and outcome (goal, violation, out, blocked). In our data, a χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-test showed a significantly higher goal rate for men (3.9%) compared to women (3.0%). For men, we found a significantly higher goal rate in the intersection sectors between players C (5.6%), D (4.9%), and in the outer sector A. In sector A, goal rate was higher only for straight shots (6.6%). Technique and trajectory did not affect goal rate for men, but flat shots showed a higher violation rate (3.2%) compared to bounce shouts (2.0%). In women&apos;s goalball, goal rate was higher only on sector D (4.4%). Bounce-rotation shots were the most successful (5.5%). We conclude that men should focus on shots to sectors C and D (called pocket) and straight shots to sector A, as long as there are no other tactical considerations. Women should shoot primarily towards the pocket. It might also be worth playing more bounce-rotation shots and practicing them in training.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524776400000</updated><fingerprint>aefefdd4</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196679</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196679</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196679</originId><author><name>Daniel Link</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524776400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Link, Christoph Weber&lt;/p&gt;

Hence, our model connects these phenomenological data with the molecular details of the cell cycle, providing a systems-level perspective of budding yeast size control.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300160v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-03863-z/MediaObjects/41467_2018_3863_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>576</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height></visual><title>Improving wood properties for wood utilization through multi-omics integration in lignin biosynthesis</title><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162e25dc445:498d910:34f43e70</id><crawled>1524216218693</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improving wood properties for wood utilization through multi-omics integration in lignin biosynthesis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving wood properties for wood utilization through multi-omics integration in lignin biosynthesis, Published online: 20 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03863-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03863-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A systematic analysis of lignin biosynthetic genes to quantitatively understand their effect on wood properties is still lacking.

The neurons that form the mammalian neocortex originate from progenitor cells in the ventricular (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ). Newborn neurons are multipolar but become bipolar during their migration from the germinal layers to the cortical plate (CP) by forming a leading process and an axon that extends in the intermediate zone (IZ). Once they settle in the CP, neurons assume a highly polarized morphology with a single axon and multiple dendrites. The AMPK-related kinases SadA and SadB are intrinsic factors that are essential for axon formation during neuronal development downstream of Lkb1. The knockout of both genes encoding Sad kinases (&lt;i&gt;Sada&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sadb&lt;/i&gt;) results not only in a loss of axons but also a decrease in the size of the cortical plate. The defect in axon formation has been linked to a function of Sad kinases in the regulation of microtubule binding proteins. However, the causes for the reduced size of the cortical plate in the &lt;i&gt;Sada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;Sadb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; knockout remain to be analyzed in detail. Here we show that neuronal cell death is increased and the number of neural progenitors is decreased in the &lt;i&gt;Sada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;Sadb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; CP. The reduced number of progenitors is a non-cell autonomous defect since they do not express Sad kinases. These defects are restricted to the neocortex while the hippocampus remains unaffected.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524776400000</updated><fingerprint>e66fa717</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196698</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196698</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196698</originId><author><name>Pratibha Dhumale</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524776400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pratibha Dhumale, Sindhu Menon, Joanna Chiang, Andreas W.

Surveys of restored oyster reefs need to produce accurate population estimates to assess the efficacy of restoration. Due to the complex structure of subtidal oyster reefs, one effective and efficient means to sample is by patent tongs, rather than SCUBA, dredges, or bottom cores. Restored reefs vary in relief and oyster density, either of which could affect survey efficiency. This study is the first to evaluate gear (the first full grab) and survey (which includes selecting a specific half portion of the first grab for further processing) efficiencies of hand-operated patent tongs as a function of reef height and oyster density on subtidal restoration reefs. In the Great Wicomico River, a tributary of lower Chesapeake Bay, restored reefs of high- and low-relief (25–45 cm, and 8–12 cm, respectively) were constructed throughout the river as the first large-scale oyster sanctuary reef restoration effort (sanctuary acreage &gt; 20 ha at one site) in Chesapeake Bay. We designed a metal frame to guide a non-hydraulic mechanical patent tong repeatedly into the same plot on a restored reef until all oysters within the grab area were captured. Full capture was verified by an underwater remotely-operated vehicle. Samples (n = 19) were taken on nine different reefs, including five low- (n = 8) and four high-relief reefs (n = 11), over a two-year period. The gear efficiency of the patent tong was estimated to be 76% (± 5% standard error), whereas survey efficiency increased to 81% (± 10%) due to processing.

Surveys of restored oyster reefs need to produce accurate population estimates to assess the efficacy of restoration. Due to the complex structure of subtidal oyster reefs, one effective and efficient means to sample is by patent tongs, rather than SCUBA, dredges, or bottom cores. Restored reefs vary in relief and oyster density, either of which could affect survey efficiency. This study is the first to evaluate gear (the first full grab) and survey (which includes selecting a specific half portion of the first grab for further processing) efficiencies of hand-operated patent tongs as a function of reef height and oyster density on subtidal restoration reefs. In the Great Wicomico River, a tributary of lower Chesapeake Bay, restored reefs of high- and low-relief (25–45 cm, and 8–12 cm, respectively) were constructed throughout the river as the first large-scale oyster sanctuary reef restoration effort (sanctuary acreage &gt; 20 ha at one site) in Chesapeake Bay. We designed a metal frame to guide a non-hydraulic mechanical patent tong repeatedly into the same plot on a restored reef until all oysters within the grab area were captured. Full capture was verified by an underwater remotely-operated vehicle. Samples (n = 19) were taken on nine different reefs, including five low- (n = 8) and four high-relief reefs (n = 11), over a two-year period. The gear efficiency of the patent tong was estimated to be 76% (± 5% standard error), whereas survey efficiency increased to 81% (± 10%) due to processing. Neither efficiency differed significantly between young-of-the-year oysters (spat) and adults, high- and low-relief reefs, or years. As this type of patent tong is a common and cost-effective tool to evaluate oyster restoration projects as well as population density on fished habitat, knowing the gear and survey efficiencies allows for accurate and precise population estimates.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196725</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/19/E4463/F3.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>298</height></visual><title>Fully reduced HMGB1 accelerates the regeneration of multiple tissues by transitioning stem cells to GAlert [Medical Sciences]</title><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16341385bca:541311:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525807602634</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>A major discovery of recent decades has been the existence of stem cells and their potential to repair many, if not most, tissues.

Compared with the total population, patients with BMI &amp;lt;18.5 were older (68 years median); more were female (73%); more had comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index score &gt;0 in 42% vs. 33% overall), more were current smokers (45% vs. 27% overall), and acute admissions due to respiratory diseases or femoral fractures were frequent.

Coupled binuclear copper (CBC) enzymes have a conserved type 3 copper site that binds molecular oxygen to oxidize various mono- and diphenolic compounds. In this study, we found a new crystal form of catechol oxidase from &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus oryzae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ao&lt;/i&gt;CO4) and solved two new structures from two different crystals at 1.8-Å and at 2.5-Å resolutions.

Anonymized electronic medical records are an increasingly popular source of research data. However, these datasets often lack race and ethnicity information. This creates problems for researchers modeling human disease, as race and ethnicity are powerful confounders for many health exposures and treatment outcomes; race and ethnicity are closely linked to population-specific genetic variation. We showed that deep neural networks generate more accurate estimates for missing racial and ethnic information than competing methods (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, and gradient-boosted decision trees). RIDDLE yielded significantly better classification performance across all metrics that were considered: accuracy, cross-entropy loss (error), precision, recall, and area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic plots (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;).

Anonymized electronic medical records are an increasingly popular source of research data. However, these datasets often lack race and ethnicity information. This creates problems for researchers modeling human disease, as race and ethnicity are powerful confounders for many health exposures and treatment outcomes; race and ethnicity are closely linked to population-specific genetic variation. We showed that deep neural networks generate more accurate estimates for missing racial and ethnic information than competing methods (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, and gradient-boosted decision trees). RIDDLE yielded significantly better classification performance across all metrics that were considered: accuracy, cross-entropy loss (error), precision, recall, and area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic plots (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). We made specific efforts to interpret the trained neural network models to identify, quantify, and visualize medical features which are predictive of race and ethnicity. We used these characterizations of informative features to perform a systematic comparison of differential disease patterns by race and ethnicity. The fact that clinical histories are informative for imputing race and ethnicity could reflect (1) a skewed distribution of blue- and white-collar professions across racial and ethnic groups, (2) uneven accessibility and subjective importance of prophylactic health, (3) possible variation in lifestyle, such as dietary habits, and (4) differences in background genetic variation which predispose to diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4S7ZYbUulAk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/4S7ZYbUulAk/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Identification of a transporter complex responsible for the cytosolic entry of nitrogen-containing-bisphosphonates</title><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16349f9cd25:1300725:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525954497829</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>11d3d0e0</fingerprint><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item><item>Cell Biology</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36620</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><summary><content>Nitrogen-containing-bisphosphonates (N-BPs) are a class of drugs widely prescribed to treat osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by enhanced pulmonary vascular resistance, which causes right ventricle (RV) pressure overload and results in right sided heart failure and death. This work investigated the effectiveness of a combined therapy with PDE5 inhibitor (PDE5i) and a new adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) agonist in mitigating monocrotaline (MCT) induced PH in rats.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An in vitro isobolographic analysis was performed to identify possible synergistic relaxation effect between sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 in rat pulmonary arteries (PAs). In the in vivo experiments, PH was induced in male Wistar rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg MCT. Rats were divided into the following groups: control (saline injection only), MCT + vehicle, MCT + sildenafil, MCT + LASSBio 1359 and MCT + combination of sildenafil and LASSBio 1359. Fourteen days after the MCT injection, rats were treated daily with oral administration of the regimen therapies or vehicle for 14 days. Cardiopulmonary system function and structure were evaluated by echocardiography. RV systolic pressure and PA endothelial function were measured.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Isobolographic analysis showed a synergistic interaction between sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 in rat PAs. Combined therapy with sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 but not monotreatment with low dosages of either sildenafil or LASSBio 1359 ameliorated all of PH related abnormalities in cardiopulmonary function and structure in MCT challenged rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 has a synergistic interaction, suggesting that combined use of these pharmacological targets may be an alternative to improve quality of life and outcomes for PH patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><fingerprint>fbd13b0a</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195047</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195047</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195047</originId><author><name>Allan K.

The spread of antibiotic resistance is always a consequence of evolutionary processes. The consideration of evolution is thus key to the development of sustainable therapy. Two main factors were recently proposed to enhance long-term effectiveness of drug combinations: evolved collateral sensitivities between the drugs in a pair and antagonistic drug interactions. We systematically assessed these factors by performing over 1,600 evolution experiments with the opportunistic nosocomial pathogen &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; in single- and multidrug environments. Based on the growth dynamics during these experiments, we reconstructed antibiotic combination efficacy (ACE) networks as a new tool for characterizing the ability of the tested drug combinations to constrain bacterial survival as well as drug resistance evolution across time. Subsequent statistical analysis of the influence of the factors on ACE network characteristics revealed that (i) synergistic drug interactions increased the likelihood of bacterial population extinction—irrespective of whether combinations were compared at the same level of inhibition or not—while (ii) the potential for evolved collateral sensitivities between 2 drugs accounted for a reduction in bacterial adaptation rates. In sum, our systematic experimental analysis allowed us to pinpoint 2 complementary determinants of combination efficacy and to identify specific drug pairs with high ACE scores. Our findings can guide attempts to further improve the sustainability of antibiotic therapy by simultaneously reducing pathogen load and resistance evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YvqYr2rgaRA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><fingerprint>b2c4d1ff</fingerprint><engagement>201</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004356</link><title>Antibiotic combination efficacy (ACE) networks for a &amp;lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&amp;lt;/i&gt; model</title><author><name>Camilo Barbosa</name></author><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004356</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1525122000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Camilo Barbosa, Robert Beardmore, Hinrich Schulenburg, Gunther Jansen&lt;/p&gt;

Then, we propose a simple nearest neighbor model (Ising model) to understand the statistical variations in human miRNAs.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319301v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b12510/20180412/images/medium/jp-2017-125106_0008.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>195</height></visual><title>[ASAP] Accurate Binding of Sodium and Calcium to a POPC Bilayer by Effective Inclusion of Electronic Polarization</title><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_162baad69bc:b89d21:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523550349756</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>62bdb897</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b12510/20180412/images/medium/jp-2017-125106_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12510&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The present study investigated the interplay between selective inhibition (the ability to suppress specific competing responses) and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any inappropriate response) during single word production. To this end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task. Selective inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to name target pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words. Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250 ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures with semantically related distractors than with unrelated distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a common inhibitory mechanism during different stages of the speech production process.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>619de92</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</originId><author><name>Ruben D.

Alveolar epithelial cells are critical to the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which are associated with overexpression of type 2 cytokine IL-13. IL-13 is known to induce the production of profibrotic (e.g., periostin) and pro-inflammatory (e.g., eotaxin-3) mediators in human airway epithelial cells, but it remains unclear if human primary alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression following IL-13 stimulation. The goals of this study are to determine if alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression upon IL-13 stimulation, and if alveolar and airway epithelial cells from the same subjects have similar responses to IL-13. Paired alveolar and airway epithelial cells were isolated from donors without any lung disease, and cultured under submerged or air-liquid interface conditions with or without IL-13. Up-regulation of periostin protein and mRNA was observed in IL-13-stimulated alveolar epithelial cells, which was comparable to that in IL-13-stimulated paired airway epithelial cells. IL-13 also increased eotaxin-3 expression in alveolar epithelial cells, but the level of eotaxin mRNA was lower in alveolar epithelial cells than in airway epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that human alveolar epithelial cells are able to produce periostin and eotaxin in responses to IL-13 stimulation. This study suggests the need to further determine the contribution of alveolar epithelial cell-derived mediators to pulmonary fibrosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524171600000</updated><fingerprint>3c6ce039</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196256</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196256</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196256</originId><author><name>Yoko Ito</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524171600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoko Ito, Reem Al Mubarak, Nicole Roberts, Kelly Correll, William Janssen, James Finigan, Rangnath Mishra, Hong Wei Chu&lt;/p&gt;

Little is known about people’s ability to detect subclinical psychopathy from others’ quotidian social behavior, or about the correlates of variation in this ability. This study sought to address these questions using a thin slice personality judgment paradigm. We presented 108 undergraduate judges (70.4% female) with 1.5 minute video thin slices of zero-acquaintance triadic conversations among other undergraduates (targets: n = 105, 57.1% female). Judges completed self-report measures of general trust, caution, and empathy. Target individuals had completed the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy (LSRP) scale. Judges viewed the videos in one of three conditions: complete audio, silent, or audio from which semantic content had been removed using low-pass filtering. Using a novel other-rating version of the LSRP, judges’ ratings of targets’ primary psychopathy levels were significantly positively associated with targets’ self-reports, but only in the complete audio condition. Judge general trust and target LSRP interacted, such that judges higher in general trust made less accurate judgments with respect to targets higher in primary and total psychopathy. Results are consistent with a scenario in which psychopathic traits are maintained in human populations by negative frequency dependent selection operating through the costs of detecting psychopathy in others.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><fingerprint>fc0b7ccc</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196729</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196729</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196729</originId><author><name>Joseph H.

However, their utility is hampered by the lack of fast, inexpensive, and accurate methods for quantifying bacterial community composition. For instance, while next-generation amplicon sequencing can be very accurate, high costs (&gt;$30 per sample) and turnaround times (&gt;1 month) limit the nature and pace of experiments. Here, we introduce a new approach for quantifying composition in synthetic bacterial communities based on Sanger sequencing. First, for a given community, we PCR-amplify a universal marker gene (here, the 16S rRNA gene), which yields a mixture of amplicons. Second, we sequence this amplicon mixture in a single Sanger sequencing reaction, which produces a &amp;quot;mixed&amp;quot; electropherogram with contributions from each community member. We also sequence each community member&apos;s marker gene individually to generate &amp;quot;individual&amp;quot; electropherograms. Third, we fit the mixed electropherogram as a linear combination of time-warped individual electropherograms, thereby allowing us to estimate the fractional amplicon abundance of each strain within the community. Importantly, our approach accounts for retention-time variability in electrophoretic signals, which is crucial for accurate compositional estimates. Using synthetic communities of marine bacterial isolates, we show that this approach yields accurate and reproducible abundance estimates for two-, four-, and seven-strain bacterial communities. Furthermore, this approach can provide results within one day and costs ~$5 USD per sample. We envision this approach will enable new insights in microbial ecology by increasing the number of samples that can be analyzed and enabling faster iteration between experiments and theory. We have implemented our method in a free and open-source R package called CASEU (&amp;quot;Compositional Analysis by Sanger Electropherogram Unmixing&amp;quot;), available at https://bitbucket.org/DattaManoshi/caseu.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a050e664</fingerprint><published>1525417200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313932v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313932v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Cermak, N.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/04/313932</canonicalUrl><description>Simple synthetic bacterial communities are powerful tools for studying microbial ecology and evolution, as they enable rapid iteration between controlled laboratory experiments and theoretical modeling.

We have implemented our method in a free and open-source R package called CASEU (&amp;quot;Compositional Analysis by Sanger Electropherogram Unmixing&amp;quot;), available at https://bitbucket.org/DattaManoshi/caseu.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313932v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Anomalous surface behavior of hydrated guanidinium ions due to ion pairing</title><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162c30cf7b9:1b85316:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523690829753</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/14&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 14&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fba21e7c</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024348?af=R</link><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024348?af=R</originId><author><name>Victor Ekholm</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523590406000</published><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024348?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Vasostatin-1: A novel circulating biomarker for ileal and pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3ae3:5785ab88</id><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Corsello, Luigi Di Filippo, Sara Massironi, Federica Sileo, Anna Dolcetta Capuzzo, Marco Gemma, Claudia Carlucci, Claudio Cusini, Barbara Colombo, Alice Dallatomasina, Giulia Maria Franchi, Angelo Corti, Marco Federico Manzoni&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Chromogranin A (CgA) is a plasma biomarker widely used in the follow-up of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). However, its accuracy as a tumor biomarker is relatively low because plasma CgA can increase also in patients with other diseases or in subjects treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), a class of widely-used drugs.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the attempt to identify a more reliable biomarker for NENs, we investigated, by ELISA, the circulating levels of full-length CgA (CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt;) and of various CgA-derived fragments in 17 patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs, 10 healthy controls, and 21 healthy volunteers before and after treatment with PPIs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs showed increased plasma levels of total-CgA and CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-76&lt;/sub&gt; fragment (vasostatin-1, VS-1) compared to controls [median (25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-percentiles); total-CgA: 1.85 nM (1.01–4.28) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.75 nM (0.52–0.89), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004; VS-1: 2.76 nM (1.09–7.10) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.29 nM (0.26–0.32), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, respectively], but not of CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt; or CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-373&lt;/sub&gt; fragment. VS-1 positively correlated with total-CgA (r = 0.65, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The Receiver Operating Characteristic area under the curve was 0.9935 for VS-1 and 0.8824 for total-CgA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.067). Treatment of patients with somatostatin analogues decreased both total-CgA and VS-1. In contrast, administration of PPIs increased the plasma levels of total-CgA, but not of VS-1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that plasma VS-1 is a novel biomarker for ileal and pancreatic NENs. Considering that VS-1 is a well-defined fragment not induced by proton-pump inhibitors, this polypeptide might represent a biomarker for NENs diagnosis and follow-up more accurate and easier to standardize than CgA.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><fingerprint>44a5a731</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196858</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196858</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196858</originId><author><name>Andrea Corsello</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525381200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Corsello, Luigi Di Filippo, Sara Massironi, Federica Sileo, Anna Dolcetta Capuzzo, Marco Gemma, Claudia Carlucci, Claudio Cusini, Barbara Colombo, Alice Dallatomasina, Giulia Maria Franchi, Angelo Corti, Marco Federico Manzoni&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;MRI is the optimal method for sensitive detection of tumour tissue and pre-operative staging in oral cancer. When jawbone resections are necessary, the current standard of care for oral tumour surgery in our hospital is 3D virtual planning from CT data. 3D printed jawbone cutting guides are designed from the CT data. The tumour margins are difficult to visualise on CT, whereas they are clearly visible on MRI scans. The aim of this study was to change the conventional CT-based workflow by developing a method for 3D MRI-based lower jaw models. The MRI-based visualisation of the tumour aids in planning bone resection margins.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and findings &lt;p&gt;A workflow for MRI-based 3D surgical planning with bone cutting guides was developed using a four-step approach. Key MRI parameters were defined (phase 1), followed by an application of selected Black Bone MRI sequences on healthy volunteers (phase 2). Three Black Bone MRI sequences were chosen for phase 3: standard, fat saturated, and an out of phase sequence. These protocols were validated by applying them on patients (n = 10) and comparison to corresponding CT data. The mean deviation values between the MRI- and the CT-based models were 0.63, 0.59 and 0.80 mm for the three evaluated Black Bone MRI sequences. Phase 4 entailed examination of the clinical value during surgery, using excellently fitting printed bone cutting guides designed from MRI-based lower jaw models, in two patients with oral cancer. The mean deviation of the resection planes was 2.3 mm, 3.8 mm for the fibula segments, and the mean axis deviation was the fibula segments of 1.9°.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study offers a method for 3D virtual resection planning and surgery using cutting guides based solely on MRI imaging.

Since the shooting of Black teenager Michael Brown by White police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, the protest hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has amplified critiques of extrajudicial killings of Black Americans. In response to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted #AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis of over 860,000 tweets, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse.

Since the shooting of Black teenager Michael Brown by White police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, the protest hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has amplified critiques of extrajudicial killings of Black Americans. In response to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted #AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis of over 860,000 tweets, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse. We find that #AllLivesMatter facilitates opposition between #BlackLivesMatter and hashtags such as #PoliceLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter in such a way that historically echoes the tension between Black protesters and law enforcement. In addition, we show that a significant portion of #AllLivesMatter use stems from hijacking by #BlackLivesMatter advocates. Beyond simply injecting #AllLivesMatter with #BlackLivesMatter content, these hijackers use the hashtag to directly confront the counter-protest notion of “All lives matter.” Our findings suggest that Black Lives Matter movement was able to grow, exhibit diverse conversations, and avoid derailment on social media by making discussion of counter-protest opinions a central topic of #AllLivesMatter, rather than the movement itself.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195644</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04779-w/d41586-018-04779-w_15675544.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height></visual><title>A robot that builds IKEA furniture in a snap</title><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162df8da05a:44e4259:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1524169023578</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A robot that builds IKEA furniture in a snap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robot that builds IKEA furniture in a snap, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04779-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04779-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Machine made from off-the-shelf components constructs chair from a kit in less than 25 minutes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>982cb89</fingerprint><engagement>81</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04779-w</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04779-w</originId><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1524121200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A robot that builds IKEA furniture in a snap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robot that builds IKEA furniture in a snap, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04779-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04779-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Machine made from off-the-shelf components constructs chair from a kit in less than 25 minutes.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04779-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Mfn2 ubiquitination by PINK1/parkin gates the p97-dependent release of ER from mitochondria to drive mitophagy</title><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162e2e0c137:49fd9ed:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1524224803127</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>aa17a5d2</fingerprint><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32866</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><summary><content>Despite their importance as signaling hubs, the function of mitochondria-ER contact sites in mitochondrial quality control pathways remains unexplored.

Characterising the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogens &lt;i&gt;in natura&lt;/i&gt; is key to ensuring their efficient prevention and control. However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate dispersal parameters at scales that are relevant to real epidemics. Epidemiological surveys can provide informative data, but parameter estimation can be hampered when the timing of the epidemiological events is uncertain, and in the presence of interactions between disease spread, surveillance, and control. Further complications arise from imperfect detection of disease and from the huge number of data on individual hosts arising from landscape-level surveys. Here, we present a Bayesian framework that overcomes these barriers by integrating over associated uncertainties in a model explicitly combining the processes of disease dispersal, surveillance and control. Using a novel computationally efficient approach to account for patch geometry, we demonstrate that disease dispersal distances can be estimated accurately in a patchy (i.e. fragmented) landscape when disease control is ongoing. Applying this model to data for an aphid-borne virus (&lt;i&gt;Plum pox virus&lt;/i&gt;) surveyed for 15 years in 605 orchards, we obtain the first estimate of the distribution of flight distances of infectious aphids at the landscape scale. About 50% of aphid flights terminate beyond 90 m, which implies that most infectious aphids leaving a tree land outside the bounds of a 1-ha orchard. Moreover, long-distance flights are not rare–10% of flights exceed 1 km. By their impact on our quantitative understanding of winged aphid dispersal, these results can inform the design of management strategies for plant viruses, which are mainly aphid-borne.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6RNe0Vdqjuk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><fingerprint>16888576</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006085</link><title>Estimation of the dispersal distances of an aphid-borne virus in a patchy landscape</title><author><name>David R.

Characterising the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogens &lt;i&gt;in natura&lt;/i&gt; is key to ensuring their efficient prevention and control. However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate dispersal parameters at scales that are relevant to real epidemics. Epidemiological surveys can provide informative data, but parameter estimation can be hampered when the timing of the epidemiological events is uncertain, and in the presence of interactions between disease spread, surveillance, and control. Further complications arise from imperfect detection of disease and from the huge number of data on individual hosts arising from landscape-level surveys. Here, we present a Bayesian framework that overcomes these barriers by integrating over associated uncertainties in a model explicitly combining the processes of disease dispersal, surveillance and control. Using a novel computationally efficient approach to account for patch geometry, we demonstrate that disease dispersal distances can be estimated accurately in a patchy (i.e. fragmented) landscape when disease control is ongoing. Applying this model to data for an aphid-borne virus (&lt;i&gt;Plum pox virus&lt;/i&gt;) surveyed for 15 years in 605 orchards, we obtain the first estimate of the distribution of flight distances of infectious aphids at the landscape scale. About 50% of aphid flights terminate beyond 90 m, which implies that most infectious aphids leaving a tree land outside the bounds of a 1-ha orchard. Moreover, long-distance flights are not rare–10% of flights exceed 1 km. By their impact on our quantitative understanding of winged aphid dispersal, these results can inform the design of management strategies for plant viruses, which are mainly aphid-borne.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6RNe0Vdqjuk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/6RNe0Vdqjuk/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.7b00640/20180416/images/medium/ci-2017-006404_0009.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>324</height></visual><title>[ASAP] Role of Molecular Interactions and Protein Rearrangement in the Dissociation Kinetics of p38a MAP Kinase Type-I/II/III Inhibitors</title><id>bE0mPve90xtDW7Mgx9+xm/gIKXt54qktoOvefuUy0ZI=_162d017f3f1:f93a9b:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1523909653489</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>c37335e2</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jcisd8</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.7b00640/20180416/images/medium/ci-2017-006404_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00640&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/645?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Publisher Correction: Chloroquine modulates antitumor immune response by resetting tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype</title><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1631b03fc98:2393e6c:4e164c41</id><crawled>1525166636184</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Chloroquine modulates antitumor immune response by resetting tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Chloroquine modulates antitumor immune response by resetting tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04169-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04169-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Chloroquine modulates antitumor immune response by resetting tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/S5TPx13CPK0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ac1c61e8</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04169-w</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04169-w</originId><author><name>Degao Chen</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04169-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1525158000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Chloroquine modulates antitumor immune response by resetting tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Chloroquine modulates antitumor immune response by resetting tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04169-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04169-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Chloroquine modulates antitumor immune response by resetting tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/S5TPx13CPK0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/S5TPx13CPK0/s41467-018-04169-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00158/20180510/images/medium/bi-2018-00158n_0008.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>284</height></visual><title>[ASAP] Protein Cofactors Are Essential for High-Affinity DNA Binding by the Nuclear Factor ?B RelA Subunit</title><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_1634adc0454:40d6ae:abeb7260</id><crawled>1525969323092</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>3d1a304f</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00158/20180510/images/medium/bi-2018-00158n_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00158&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The annual increase in costs and the quality of life of survivors of cardiac arrest are major concerns. This study used National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to evaluate the 1-year survival rate and the annual healthcare costs of survivors after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective, fixed-cohort study conducted from 2006 to 2012, involved 2 million individuals randomly selected from the NHIRD of Taiwan. Adult patients at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with cardiac arrest were enrolled. Survival was followed up for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 2,256 patients were enrolled. The survivor cohort accounted for 4% (89/2256) of the study population. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the survival and non-survival cohorts, with the exceptions of gender (male: survival vs. non-survival, 50.6% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.007), diabetes mellitus (49.4% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.009), and acute coronary syndrome (44.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.010). Only 38 (1.7%) patients survived for &gt; 1 year. The mean re-admission to hospital during the 1-year follow up was 73.5 (SD: 110.2) days. The mean healthcare cost during the 1-year follow up was $12,953. Factors associated with total healthcare costs during the 1-year follow up were as follows: city or county of residence, being widowed, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (city or county of residence, β: -23,604, p &amp;lt; 0.001; being widowed, β: 25,588, p = 0.049; COPD, β: 14,438, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a great burden of the annual healthcare costs of survivors of cardiac arrest.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The annual increase in costs and the quality of life of survivors of cardiac arrest are major concerns. This study used National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to evaluate the 1-year survival rate and the annual healthcare costs of survivors after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective, fixed-cohort study conducted from 2006 to 2012, involved 2 million individuals randomly selected from the NHIRD of Taiwan. Adult patients at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with cardiac arrest were enrolled. Survival was followed up for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 2,256 patients were enrolled. The survivor cohort accounted for 4% (89/2256) of the study population. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the survival and non-survival cohorts, with the exceptions of gender (male: survival vs. non-survival, 50.6% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.007), diabetes mellitus (49.4% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.009), and acute coronary syndrome (44.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.010). Only 38 (1.7%) patients survived for &gt; 1 year. The mean re-admission to hospital during the 1-year follow up was 73.5 (SD: 110.2) days. The mean healthcare cost during the 1-year follow up was $12,953. Factors associated with total healthcare costs during the 1-year follow up were as follows: city or county of residence, being widowed, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (city or county of residence, β: -23,604, p &amp;lt; 0.001; being widowed, β: 25,588, p = 0.049; COPD, β: 14,438, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a great burden of the annual healthcare costs of survivors of cardiac arrest. Socioeconomic status and comorbidity were major confounders of costs. The outcome measures of cardiac arrest should extend beyond the death, and encompass destitution. These findings add to our knowledge of the health economics and indicate future research about healthcare of cardiac arrest survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196687</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b11998/20180409/images/medium/jp-2017-119985_0003.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>280</height></visual><title>[ASAP] Surface Behavior of BSA/Water/Carbohydrate Systems from Molecular Polarizability Measurements</title><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_162af8dda8e:2f71f:a077e55f</id><crawled>1523363732110</crawled><unread>False</unread><fingerprint>26ceeb45</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b11998/20180409/images/medium/jp-2017-119985_0003.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11998&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm). In addition, a moderate nitrogen rate (240 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) could increase root growth, especially in the shallow soil layers. The differences observed with the minirhizotron method were clearer than those observed with the soil coring method.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>ca9bf785</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197284</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197284</originId><author><name>Jing Chen</name></author><published>1526072400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Chen, Liantao Liu, Zhanbiao Wang, Hongchun Sun, Yongjiang Zhang, Zhanyuan Lu, Cundong Li&lt;/p&gt;

The forces driving the accumulation and removal of non-coding DNA and ultimately the evolution of genome size in complex organisms are intimately linked to genome structure and organisation. Our analysis provides a novel method for capturing the regional variation of lineage-specific DNA gain and loss events in their respective genomic contexts. To further understand this connection we used comparative genomics to identify genome-wide individual DNA gain and loss events in the human and mouse genomes. Focusing on the distribution of DNA gains and losses, relationships to important structural features and potential impact on biological processes, we found that in autosomes, DNA gains and losses both followed separate lineage-specific accumulation patterns. However, in both species chromosome X was particularly enriched for DNA gain, consistent with its high L1 retrotransposon content required for X inactivation. We found that DNA loss was associated with gene-rich open chromatin regions and DNA gain events with gene-poor closed chromatin regions. Additionally, we found that DNA loss events tended to be smaller than DNA gain events suggesting that they were able to accumulate in gene-rich open chromatin regions due to their reduced capacity to interrupt gene regulatory architecture. GO term enrichment showed that mouse loss hotspots were strongly enriched for terms related to developmental processes. However, these genes were also located in regions with a high density of conserved elements, suggesting that despite high levels of DNA loss, gene regulatory architecture remained conserved. This is consistent with a model in which DNA gain and loss results in turnover or “churning” in regulatory element dense regions of open chromatin, where interruption of regulatory elements is selected against.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H1rMm4y09CQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><fingerprint>e975cac8</fingerprint><engagement>9</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006091</link><title>Divergent genome evolution caused by regional variation in DNA gain and loss between human and mouse</title><author><name>Reuben M.

Sweat includes active components and metabolites, which are needed to maintain skin homeostasis. Component changes in sweat derived from atopic dermatitis (AD) have been reported. To investigate the influence of sweat components on the pathogenesis of AD, we performed a multifaceted assessment, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolomic analysis, and linked these features to clinical features of AD. Distinctive properties of AD sweat are the quite-variation in protein, anti-microbial peptides and glucose concentrations. pH, sodium, and other salt levels in sweat of AD were comparable to that of healthy subjects. Sweat from AD patients with acute inflammation had a more prominent increase in glucose concentration than sweat from healthy individuals or those with AD with chronic inflammation. Topical glucose application delayed recovery of transepidermal water loss in barrier-disrupted mice. Furthermore, the glucose transporter GLUT2 was highly expressed in the lumen of sweat glands from AD patients. AD patients with chronic inflammation had significantly increased &lt;i&gt;GLUT2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression and near normal sweat glucose levels. Despite the small sample size in our study, we speculate that the increased glucose levels might be affected by AD severity and phenotype.

Background &lt;p&gt;A prospective Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program has been implemented in Korea to improve the quality and safety of medication use.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the influence of the DUR program in reducing incidence of preventable adverse drug reactions (pADRs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was performed using administrative data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA). The claims data for all adult patients with adverse drug events (ADE)-related diagnoses from 2009 to 2014 were obtained. Incidence rates of first-time and repeat pADRs prior to and after DUR program implementation were evaluated. Quarterly trends in incidence rates of overall ADE, allergic reactions, and ADRs were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data extraction covering the period from 2009 to 2014 led to the identification of 3,927,662 records. First-time pADR rates decreased gradually after implementation of the DUR program (change in slope: -0.016, p = 0.02). The program had a similar influence on repeat pADR rates (change in slope: -0.006, p≤0.01). The program did not decrease rates of first-time or repeat allergic reactions (change in slope: 0.018, p = 0.07 and 0.003, p = 0.04, respectively). In the cohort aged ≤65 years, first-time pADR rate reduction was significant (28.2% [27.1–29.3] in ≤18 years, and 19.8% [18.1–21.5] in 19–64 years).

Background &lt;p&gt;A prospective Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program has been implemented in Korea to improve the quality and safety of medication use.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the influence of the DUR program in reducing incidence of preventable adverse drug reactions (pADRs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was performed using administrative data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA). The claims data for all adult patients with adverse drug events (ADE)-related diagnoses from 2009 to 2014 were obtained. Incidence rates of first-time and repeat pADRs prior to and after DUR program implementation were evaluated. Quarterly trends in incidence rates of overall ADE, allergic reactions, and ADRs were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data extraction covering the period from 2009 to 2014 led to the identification of 3,927,662 records. First-time pADR rates decreased gradually after implementation of the DUR program (change in slope: -0.016, p = 0.02). The program had a similar influence on repeat pADR rates (change in slope: -0.006, p≤0.01). The program did not decrease rates of first-time or repeat allergic reactions (change in slope: 0.018, p = 0.07 and 0.003, p = 0.04, respectively). In the cohort aged ≤65 years, first-time pADR rate reduction was significant (28.2% [27.1–29.3] in ≤18 years, and 19.8% [18.1–21.5] in 19–64 years). In contrast, first-time pADR rate was increased by 0.6% [-0.7–1.9] in patients ≥65 years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Implementation of the prospective DUR program effectively reduced the number of pADRs. In the future, to reduce non-preventable ADRs such as allergic reactions, provision of clinical information including allergy history should be added to the DUR program.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195434</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Trends in use of acupuncture among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011: A nationwide population-based study</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b0:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><unread>False</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mei-Yao Wu, Yu-Chen Lee, Cheng-Li Lin, Ming-Cheng Huang, Mao-Feng Sun, Hung-Rong Yen&lt;/p&gt;
In recent years, acupuncture has gained in popularity worldwide. However, recent epidemiological studies are lacking. We conducted this study to investigate the trends in acupuncture utilization among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000), which contains all original claims data for 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from the registry of all beneficiaries enrolled in the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 2000. The one-year prevalence of acupuncture use among adults increased from 7.98% in 2002 to 10.9% in 2011. Acupuncture use significantly increased yearly (incidence rate ratio = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03−1.05, p&amp;lt;0.001). Patients who were female, were middle-aged, resided in highly urbanized areas and suffered from injury or disorders of the musculoskeletal system were prone to more frequent acupuncture use. Our study revealed that the utilization of acupuncture became increasingly popular in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. Our findings may provide useful information for clinical practice and research as well as for health policy decision making.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523394000000</updated><fingerprint>95378d3e</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195490</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195490</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195490</originId><author><name>Mei-Yao Wu</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1523394000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mei-Yao Wu, Yu-Chen Lee, Cheng-Li Lin, Ming-Cheng Huang, Mao-Feng Sun, Hung-Rong Yen&lt;/p&gt;

We conclude that the use of oxidized whole-tumor lysate DC vaccine is safe and effective in eliciting a broad antitumor immunity, including private neoantigens, and warrants further clinical testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/436/eaao5931?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Animal tests surge under new U.S. chemical law</title><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7f5:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>f2c98fcb</fingerprint><keywords><item>Science and Policy</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/585.full</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/585?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/585?rss=1</originId><engagementRate>0.65</engagementRate><author><name>Zainzinger, V.</name></author><engagement>13</engagement><published>1525974002000</published><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/585?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>First record of &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; formation of ectomycorrhizae in &amp;lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&amp;lt;/i&gt; Sabine, a native Myrtaceae of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47505f:2835af05</id><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;
Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>1199cc1d</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196984</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196984</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196984</originId><author><name>Cassio Geremia Freire</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;

Repositioning of the maxilla in orthognathic surgery is carried out for functional and aesthetic purposes. Pre-surgical planning tools can predict 3D facial appearance by computing the response of the soft tissue to the changes to the underlying skeleton. The clinical use of commercial prediction software remains controversial, likely due to the deterministic nature of these computational predictions. A novel probabilistic finite element model (FEM) for the prediction of postoperative facial soft tissues is proposed in this paper. A probabilistic FEM was developed and validated on a cohort of eight patients who underwent maxillary repositioning and had pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken. Firstly, a variables correlation assessed various modelling parameters. Secondly, a design of experiments (DOE) provided a range of potential outcomes based on uniformly distributed input parameters, followed by an optimisation. Lastly, the second DOE iteration provided optimised predictions with a probability range. A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>bf09ec4d</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</originId><author><name>Paul G.

The ability to determine the origin of soybeans is an important issue following the inclusion of this information in the labeling of agricultural food products becoming mandatory in South Korea in 2017. This study was carried out to construct a prediction model for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybeans using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis. The optimal prediction models for discriminating soybean samples were obtained by selecting appropriate scaling methods, normalization methods, variable influence on projection (VIP) cutoff values, and wave-number regions. The factors for constructing the optimal partial-least-squares regression (PLSR) prediction model were using second derivatives, vector normalization, unit variance scaling, and the 4000–400 cm&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; region (excluding water vapor and carbon dioxide). The PLSR model for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybean samples had the best predictability when a VIP cutoff value was not applied. When Chinese soybean samples were identified, a PLSR model that has the lowest root-mean-square error of the prediction value was obtained using a VIP cutoff value of 1.5. The optimal PLSR prediction model for discriminating Korean soybean samples was also obtained using a VIP cutoff value of 1.5.

We need all the reality checks we can get, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/423&quot;&gt;and this one&lt;/a&gt; (reported by a large multinational team led out of Oxford) uses light scattering to get more mass resolution than I would have thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light scattering by small particles depends on their refractive index and the particle volume. Proteins have basically the same refractive index (the indices of the individual amino acids don’t vary that much, and it’s all averaged out). Likewise, the volume occupied by each amino acid is very similar as well, and putting these together means that if you do very accurate light scattering measurements (using interferometry) the signal you get should be proportional to the number of amino acid residues or the total mass. This effect has been predicted, but recent improvements in instrumentation have made it possible to actually observe this and use it in real applications. The group gives the technique the deliberately memorable name of iSCAMS (interferometric scattering mass spectrometry), and we’ll have to get used to the idea of being able to do “mass spec” with a microscope and visible light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over a range of proteins (both monomers and larger oligomers), the team found a very good correlation (within 1.8%, plus or minus half a per cent) between the interferomic signature and protein mass, one that (importantly) was not influenced by the three-dimensional shape of the protein itself. The correlation also held for lipid nanodisc species, which is a good sign. And since I was writing just the other day about glycosylated proteins, I note that they also observed various states of a highly glycosylated (up to half the molecular weight) HIV envelope complex, and could spot the differences there as well. So it look like the effect holds for a number of different biomolecule types, although I expect that there will be refinements to the scattering models for these as the technique is developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like it could be a very good technique for studying protein-protein interactions &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and it has the potential advantage of spatial resolution as well. I’m not sure if you could ever get something like this to work in a living cell (the signal/noise would be a huge problem), but there’s a lot of biomolecular behavior that you could get new details on short of that. There are a lot of variations to try, such as different surfaces, and immobilized binding partners. This could be a good complement to techniques like SPR, only this time at a single-protein level. It’ll be interesting to see if it can get to the point of delivering on- and off-rates, which is one of SPR’s great advantages. As it stands now, the resolution of iSCAMS doesn’t seem good enough to detect small-molecule binding to individual proteins, but it could certainly pick up small molecule effects on protein complexes, and presumably effects on protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-polysaccharide interactions as well. That should keep everyone occupied!&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ff33f6dc</fingerprint><keywords><item>Analytical Chemistry</item><item>Drug Assays</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/10/a-new-method-to-weigh-biomolecules</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><summary><content>I’m always happy when a new analytical technique is worked out, especially one that’s applicable to biological binding assays, doesn’t require labeling of the species involved, and is orthogonal to the existing methods.

During this regenerative window, cardiac energy metabolism shifts from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation, and recent evidence suggests that metabolism may participate in controlling cardiomyocyte cell cycle. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating the loss of postnatal cardiac regeneration are not fully understood. Objective: This study aims at providing an integrated resource of mRNA, protein and metabolite changes in the neonatal heart to identify metabolism-related mechanisms associated with the postnatal loss of regenerative capacity. Methods and Results: Mouse ventricular tissue samples taken on postnatal days 1, 4, 9 and 23 (P01, P04, P09 and P23, respectively) were analyzed with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and global proteomics and metabolomics. Differential expression was observed for 8547 mRNAs and for 1199 of the 2285 quantified proteins. Furthermore, 151 metabolites with significant changes were identified. Gene ontology analysis, KEGG pathway analysis and fuzzy c-means clustering were used to identify biological processes and metabolic pathways either up- or downregulated on all three levels. Among these were branched chain amino acid degradation (upregulated at P23) and production of free saturated and monounsaturated medium- to long-chain fatty acids (upregulated at P04 and P09; downregulated at P23). Moreover, the HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS)-mediated mevalonate pathway and ketogenesis were transiently activated. Pharmacological inhibition of HMGCS in primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes reduced the percentage of BrdU+ cardiomyocytes, providing evidence that the mevalonate and ketogenesis routes may participate in regulating cardiomyocyte cell cycle. Conclusions: This is the first systems-level resource combining data from genome-wide transcriptomics with global quantitative proteomics and untargeted metabolomics analyses of the mouse heart throughout the early postnatal period. This integrated multi-level data of molecular changes associated with the loss of cardiac regeneration may open up new possibilities for the development of regenerative therapies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>bbce4775</fingerprint><published>1524466800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302802v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302802v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Talman, V.</name></author><engagement>30</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/23/302802</canonicalUrl><description>Rationale: Mammals lose the ability to regenerate their hearts within one week after birth.

Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) respond to numerous hormonal and neural signals, resulting in changes in food intake. Here, we demonstrate that ARC POMC neurons express capsaicin-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1)-like receptors. To show expression of TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons, we use single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, TRPV1 knock-out (KO), and TRPV1-Cre knock-in mice. A small elevation of temperature in the physiological range is enough to depolarize ARC POMC neurons. This depolarization is blocked by the TRPV1 receptor antagonist and by &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt; gene knockdown. Capsaicin-induced activation reduces food intake that is abolished by a melanocortin receptor antagonist. To selectively stimulate TRPV1-like receptor-expressing ARC POMC neurons in the ARC, we generate an adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) carrying a Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) expression cassette under the control of the two neuronal POMC enhancers (nPEs). Optogenetic stimulation of TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neurons decreases food intake. Hypothalamic temperature is rapidly elevated and reaches to approximately 39 °C during treadmill running. This elevation is associated with a reduction in food intake. Knockdown of the &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt; gene exclusively in ARC POMC neurons blocks the feeding inhibition produced by increased hypothalamic temperature. Taken together, our findings identify a melanocortinergic circuit that links acute elevations in hypothalamic temperature with acute reductions in food intake.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LGEs5NFlL1s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524603600000</updated><fingerprint>903106e8</fingerprint><engagement>84</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004399</link><title>Activation of temperature-sensitive TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons reduces food intake</title><author><name>Jae Hoon Jeong</name></author><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004399</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1524603600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jae Hoon Jeong, Dong Kun Lee, Shun-Mei Liu, Streamson C.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing architectures with many interconnections of simple neural-inspired computing elements, and have been applied to biomedical fields such as imaging analysis and diagnosis. We have developed a new ANN framework called Cox-nnet to predict patient prognosis from high throughput transcriptomics data. In 10 TCGA RNA-Seq data sets, Cox-nnet achieves the same or better predictive accuracy compared to other methods, including Cox-proportional hazards regression (with LASSO, ridge, and mimimax concave penalty), Random Forests Survival and CoxBoost. Cox-nnet also reveals richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels. The outputs from the hidden layer node provide an alternative approach for survival-sensitive dimension reduction. In summary, we have developed a new method for accurate and efficient prognosis prediction on high throughput data, with functional biological insights.

Endometrial Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (endMSCs) are multipotent cells with immunomodulatory and pro-regenerative activity which is mainly mediated by a paracrine effect. The exosomes released by MSCs have become a promising therapeutic tool for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. More specifically, extracellular vesicles derived from endMSCs (EV-endMSCs) have demonstrated a cardioprotective effect through the release of anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic factors. Here we hypothesize that EV-endMSCs may be used as a co-adjuvant to improve &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; fertilization outcomes and embryo quality. Firstly, endMSCs and EV-endMSCs were isolated and phenotypically characterized for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays. Then, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies were performed on murine embryos co-cultured with EV-endMSCs at different concentrations. Our results firstly demonstrated a significant increase on the total blastomere count of expanded murine blastocysts. Moreover, EV-endMSCs triggered the release of pro-angiogenic molecules from embryos demonstrating an EV-endMSCs concentration-dependent increase of VEGF and PDGF-AA. The release of VEGF and PDGF-AA by the embryos may indicate that the beneficial effect of EV-endMSCs could be mediating not only an increase in the blastocyst’s total cell number, but also may promote endometrial angiogenesis, vascularization, differentiation and tissue remodeling. In summary, these results could be relevant for assisted reproduction being the first report describing the beneficial effect of human EV-endMSCs on embryo development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><fingerprint>9fb380f7</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196080</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196080</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196080</originId><author><name>Rebeca Blázquez</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524517200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebeca Blázquez, Francisco Miguel Sánchez-Margallo, Verónica Álvarez, Elvira Matilla, Nuria Hernández, Federica Marinaro, María Gómez-Serrano, Inmaculada Jorge, Javier G.

However, the site-specific substrate within these engram cells remains theoretical, even though it is generally accepted that synaptic plasticity encodes memories. We developed the dual-eGRASP (green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners) technique to examine synapses between engram cells to identify the specific neuronal site for memory storage. We found an increased number and size of spines on CA1 engram cells receiving input from CA3 engram cells.

However, the site-specific substrate within these engram cells remains theoretical, even though it is generally accepted that synaptic plasticity encodes memories. We developed the dual-eGRASP (green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners) technique to examine synapses between engram cells to identify the specific neuronal site for memory storage. We found an increased number and size of spines on CA1 engram cells receiving input from CA3 engram cells. In contextual fear conditioning, this enhanced connectivity between engram cells encoded memory strength. CA3 engram to CA1 engram projections strongly occluded long-term potentiation. These results indicate that enhanced structural and functional connectivity between engram cells across two directly connected brain regions forms the synaptic correlate for memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/430?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00073/20180509/images/medium/ct-2018-00073a_0006.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>420</height></visual><title>[ASAP] Multilevel Molecular Modeling Approach for a Rational Design of Ionic Current Sensors for Nanofluidics</title><id>nWAmhAfvfdY6zhQafSMhdWASYooG1IX3uplCe3rnLYA=_1634ad8ffb0:44357:d63e3ae2</id><crawled>1525969125296</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>ab8e3597</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00073/20180509/images/medium/ct-2018-00073a_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00073&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Diffusion Tensor MRI (DT-MRI) is a promising tool for the evaluation of brachial plexus pathology.

Means of fractional-anisotropy (FA), mean-diffusivity (MD), axial-diffusivity (AD), and radial-diffusivity (RD) for the individual roots and trunks were evaluated. A stepwise forward approach was applied to test for correlations with age, sex, body-mass-index (BMI), bodysurface, height, and bodyweight. Within-subject, intra-rater, and inter-rater repeatability were assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, coefficient of variation (CV), intraclass-correlation (ICC), and minimal detectable difference (MDD).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;No differences between sides and root levels were found. MD, AD, and RD correlated (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) with bodyweight. Within-subject quantification proved repeatable with CVs for FA, MD, AD, and RD of 16%, 12%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The DT-MRI protocol was fast and repeatable.

This obviously is most important (and can have the biggest effect) if your compound has a short half-life after dosing to begin with (and plenty of compounds do). As the paper notes, if you have constant clearance for the unbound fraction of your compound, then the relationship between dose and half-life is exponential, not linear (whereas most of the other combinations you can come up with are simply linear ones). That really gives you a handle to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, you don’t have to wait until human data to worry about such things. The allometric scaling factor between rats and humans is about 4.3, so if you’ve done your homework about what the mechanisms of clearance are (which enzymes are responsible and how well they correlate to human ones, for example), you’re ready to work from there. The paper notes, though, that these sorts of correlations have a much higher chance of going haywire on you for very short half-life compounds (less than two hours, say), so if you want to have any confidence at all in your dose prediction models, you really should get rat half-life out longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group shows a plot of about 10,000 Merck compounds with rat measurements of unbound-clearance versus steady-state volume of distribution, and it’s (as you might figure) a pretty good correlation. The key, then, is to find changes in a molecule’s structure that will get it off that line, because otherwise you’ll end up in a similar situation to where you started. That is, you can find yourself reducing the unbound clearance and ending up with an effective half life that’s not really improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what sorts of modifications actually improve the half-life? The paper shows the result of a large matched-molecular-pairs (MMP) analysis, where structures were varied at only one place. Increasing lipophilicity will do the trick, sometimes, if the partitioning of your compound into tissue increases more than just its binding to plasma proteins. The Merck data suggest that adding multiple fluorines to a compound’s structure tends to have this effect. The fluorinated compounds tend, apparently, to bind to tissue at an increased rate more than they bind to serum albumin. You may or may not be comfortable with this advice, since polyfluorinated compounds may also be harder to formulate, and some of that tissue binding may be to things that you’d rather not bind to. But it will increase your half-life, and it’s up to each med-chem team to see if they want to make that deal with this particular fluorocarbon-coated devil. The free lunch has (still) not yet arrived in the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, another classic way to increase half-life is to block sites of metabolism. The Merck group noted this in a general way with matched molecular pairs that changed hydrogens to chlorines, hydrogens to methyls, and methyls to chlorines. H to Cl increased half life, presumably for similar reasons to fluorination. H to methyl did not, though: that does increase lipophilicity, but at the expense of adding new groups for the liver enzymes to chew on. But methyl to chloro did improve half-lives, on average – the lipophilicities are nearly the same, but you’ve battened down the hatches for enzymatic degradation. (As you’d imagine, H to CF3 is the extreme example of this effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about replacing with more polar groups, rather than with nonstick coatings? On average, phenyl to pyridyl lowers half life, H to OH does too, and H to COOH &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lowers half-life. It’s worth noting that the carboxylic acids, overall, tend to have higher binding to plasma protein, so that tells you that the increased half-life of the halogenated compounds isn’t coming about by that mechanism, at least not exclusively. It’s worth noting, though, that just greasing up your compounds is not the answer. Fluorination and chlorination seem to work, but as a look at the broader MMP universe shows, increasing lipophilicity in general does not necessarily help your half-life. Decreasing lipophilicity, on the other hand, has a much better chance of hurting it. It looks, overall, as if the steady-state volume of distribution is more sensitive to modifications in the structure than is clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper has a list of groups that seem to help with increasing half-life, more often than not, and ones that seem to hurt. In addition to general halogenation, others in the first beneficial category include primary amines, NH pyrrolidines, piperidines, piperazines, and morpholines, 3,4-dihaloaryls, and (interestingly) 2-methyl-4-pyrimidones. In the likely-to-lower category, on the other hand, are pyridines and pyrimidines attached at the 2 position, N-attached pyrazoles (and other related 5-membered heterocycles that have that core), unsubstituted phenyls (and 4-pyridyls), primary alcohols, and simple cyclopropyls.

Background &lt;p&gt;Dengue outbreaks are increasing in frequency over space and time, affecting people’s health and burdening resource-constrained health systems. The ability to detect early emerging outbreaks is key to mounting an effective response. The early warning and response system (EWARS) is a toolkit that provides countries with early-warning systems for efficient and cost-effective local responses. EWARS uses outbreak and alarm indicators to derive prediction models that can be used prospectively to predict a forthcoming dengue outbreak at district level.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We report on the development of the EWARS tool, based on users’ recommendations into a convenient, user-friendly and reliable software aided by a user’s workbook and its field testing in 30 health districts in Brazil, Malaysia and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;34 Health officers from the 30 study districts who had used the original EWARS for 7 to 10 months responded to a questionnaire with mainly open-ended questions. Qualitative content analysis showed that participants were generally satisfied with the tool but preferred open-access vs. commercial software. EWARS users also stated that the geographical unit should be the district, while access to meteorological information should be improved. These recommendations were incorporated into the second-generation EWARS-R, using the free R software, combined with recent surveillance data and resulted in higher sensitivities and positive predictive values of alarm signals compared to the first-generation EWARS. Currently the use of satellite data for meteorological information is being tested and a dashboard is being developed to increase user-friendliness of the tool. The inclusion of other &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; borne viral diseases is under discussion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;EWARS is a pragmatic and useful tool for detecting imminent dengue outbreaks to trigger early response activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525467600000</updated><fingerprint>46706e43</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196811</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196811</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196811</originId><author><name>Laith Hussain-Alkhateeb</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525467600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laith Hussain-Alkhateeb, Axel Kroeger, Piero Olliaro, Joacim Rocklöv, Maquins Odhiambo Sewe, Gustavo Tejeda, David Benitez, Balvinder Gill, S.

The ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 degrade extracellular ATP to adenosine. ATP is released by stressed or damaged cells and provides pro-inflammatory signals to immune cells through P2 receptors. Adenosine, on the other hand, suppresses immune cells by stimulating P1 receptors. Thus, CD39 and CD73 can shape the quality of immune responses. Here we demonstrate that upregulation of CD39 is a consistent feature of activated conventional CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Following stimulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells from human blood gained surface expression of CD39 but displayed only low levels of CD73. Activated human T cells from inflamed joints largely presented with a CD39&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD73&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype. In line, in spleens of mice with acute &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, listeria-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells acquired a CD39&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD73&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype. To test the function of CD39 in control of bacterial infection, CD39-deficient (CD39&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) mice were infected with &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;. CD39&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed better initial control of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, which was associated with enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines. In the late stage of infection, CD39&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice accumulated more listeria-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the spleen than wildtype animals suggesting that CD39 attenuates the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell response to infection. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CD39 is upregulated on conventional CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells at sites of acute infection and inflammation, and that CD39 dampens responses to bacterial infection.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>1da8ce9b</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197151</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197151</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197151</originId><author><name>Friederike Raczkowski</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Friederike Raczkowski, Anne Rissiek, Isabell Ricklefs, Kirsten Heiss, Valéa Schumacher, Kira Wundenberg, Friedrich Haag, Friedrich Koch-Nolte, Eva Tolosa, Hans-Willi Mittrücker&lt;/p&gt;

Spawning ground of Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) is located near the West Mariana Ridge seamount. The species travels through the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and then enters the Kuroshio Current (KC) on the migration toward East Asian growth habitats. Therefore, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events serve as the potentially important drivers of interannual variability across the equatorial Pacific. Because the NEC bifurcation and salinity profiles are related to ENSO events, we investigated the influence of locations of the NEC bifurcation and salinity front on the success of larval entry to the KC by numerically modeling particle transport in ocean currents from 1972 to 2013 and possible effects on the size of glass eels at continental recruitment and, via otolithometry on the duration of larval migration. Circulation and hydrography used for particle tracking were obtained from the results of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) high-resolution forecasting experiment. Our results demonstrated that during El Niño years, (1) the southward movement of the salinity front might cause the larvae to experience slower currents and (2) the northward movement of the NEC bifurcation might broaden the separation between their spawning ground and NEC bifurcation, thus prolonging the time needed for the larvae to enter the KC from their spawning ground, because of which the duration of entrainment in the water column and body size increase when eels reach estuarine waters. In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523394000000</updated><fingerprint>2467dea2</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195544</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195544</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195544</originId><author><name>Kuan-Mei Hsiung</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1523394000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Mei Hsiung, Shingo Kimura, Yu-San Han, Aigo Takeshige, Yoshiyuki Iizuka&lt;/p&gt;

In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multiomics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/217554v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>[Research Articles] Alloreactive fetal T cells promote uterine contractility in preterm labor via IFN-{gamma} and TNF-{alpha}</title><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_162fe005beb:5f2ce5:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1524679859179</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Healthy pregnancy is the most successful form of graft tolerance, whereas preterm labor (PTL) may represent a breakdown in maternal-fetal tolerance.

We previously identified brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a source of sleep-inducing signals. Pharmacological activation of BAT enhances sleep while sleep loss leads to increased BAT thermogenesis. Recovery sleep after sleep loss is diminished in mice that lack uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), and also in wild-type (WT) mice after sensory denervation of the BAT. Systemic inflammation greatly affects metabolism and the function of adipose tissue, and also induces characteristic sleep responses. We hypothesized that sleep responses to acute inflammation are mediated by BAT-derived signals. To test this, we determined the effects of systemic inflammation on sleep and body temperature in UCP-1 knockout (KO) and WT mice. Intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 beta and clodronate containing liposomes were used to induce systemic inflammation. In WT animals, non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) was elevated in all four inflammatory models. All NREMS responses were completely abolished in UCP-1 KO animals. Systemic inflammation elicited an initial hypothermia followed by fever in WT mice. The hypothermic phase, but not the fever, was abolished in UCP-1 KO mice. The only recognized function of UCP-1 is to promote thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Present results indicate that the presence of UCP-1 is necessary for increased NREMS but does not contribute to the development of fever in systemic inflammation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>72df27a4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197409</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197409</originId><author><name>Éva Szentirmai</name></author><published>1525986000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Éva Szentirmai, Levente Kapás&lt;/p&gt;

The purple sea urchin, &lt;i&gt;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&lt;/i&gt;, has a complex and robust immune system that is mediated by a number of multi-gene families including the &lt;i&gt;SpTransformer&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;SpTrf&lt;/i&gt;) gene family (formerly &lt;i&gt;Sp185/333&lt;/i&gt;). In response to immune challenge from bacteria and various pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the &lt;i&gt;SpTrf&lt;/i&gt; genes are up-regulated in sea urchin phagocytes and express a diverse array of SpTrf proteins. We show here that SpTrf proteins from coelomocytes and isolated by nickel affinity (cNi-SpTrf) bind to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and to Baker’s yeast, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, with saturable kinetics and specificity. cNi-SpTrf opsonization of the marine bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Vibrio diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt;, augments phagocytosis, however, opsonization by the recombinant protein, rSpTrf-E1, does not. Binding by cNi-SpTrf proteins retards growth rates significantly for several species of bacteria. SpTrf proteins, previously thought to be strictly membrane-associated, are secreted from phagocytes in short term cultures and bind &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt; that are located both outside of and within phagocytes. Our results demonstrate anti-microbial activities of native SpTrf proteins and suggest variable functions among different SpTrf isoforms. Multiple isoforms may act synergistically to detect a wide array of pathogens and provide flexible and efficient host immunity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>4798f1f9</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196890</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196890</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196890</originId><author><name>Hung-Yen Chou</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hung-Yen Chou, Cheng Man Lun, L.

We show here that SpTrf proteins from coelomocytes and isolated by nickel affinity (cNi-SpTrf) bind to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and to Baker’s yeast, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, with saturable kinetics and specificity. cNi-SpTrf opsonization of the marine bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Vibrio diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt;, augments phagocytosis, however, opsonization by the recombinant protein, rSpTrf-E1, does not. Binding by cNi-SpTrf proteins retards growth rates significantly for several species of bacteria. SpTrf proteins, previously thought to be strictly membrane-associated, are secreted from phagocytes in short term cultures and bind &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt; that are located both outside of and within phagocytes. Our results demonstrate anti-microbial activities of native SpTrf proteins and suggest variable functions among different SpTrf isoforms. Multiple isoforms may act synergistically to detect a wide array of pathogens and provide flexible and efficient host immunity.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196890</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Force constant decomposition for penta‐coordinated XH3Cl2‐ (X = C, Si, Ge) structures</title><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1632184d727:54a61a:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525275744039</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7a730872</fingerprint><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25226?af=R</link><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><summary><content>Based on the energy decomposition analysis of an interacting system, we propose a method for force constant decomposition analysis with respect to the specific normal coordinate.

The preference-performance hypothesis states that ovipositing phytophagous insects will select host plants that are well-suited for their offspring and avoid host plants that do not support offspring performance (survival, development and fitness). The mountain pine beetle (&lt;i&gt;Dendroctonus ponderosae&lt;/i&gt;), a native insect herbivore in western North America, can successfully attack and reproduce in most species of &lt;i&gt;Pinus&lt;/i&gt; throughout its native range. However, mountain pine beetles avoid attacking Great Basin bristlecone pine (&lt;i&gt;Pinus longaeva&lt;/i&gt;), despite recent climate-driven increases in mountain pine beetle populations at the high elevations where Great Basin bristlecone pine grows. Low preference for a potential host plant species may not persist if the plant supports favorable insect offspring performance, and Great Basin bristlecone pine suitability for mountain pine beetle offspring performance is unclear. We infested cut bolts of Great Basin bristlecone pine and two susceptible host tree species, limber (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexilis&lt;/i&gt;) and lodgepole (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;contorta&lt;/i&gt;) pines with adult mountain pine beetles and compared offspring performance. To investigate the potential for variation in offspring performance among mountain pine beetles from different areas, we tested beetles from geographically-separated populations within and outside the current range of Great Basin bristlecone pine. Although mountain pine beetles constructed galleries and laid viable eggs in all three tree species, extremely few offspring emerged from Great Basin bristlecone pine, regardless of the beetle population. Our observed low offspring performance in Great Basin bristlecone pine corresponds with previously documented low mountain pine beetle attack preference. A low preference-low performance relationship suggests that Great Basin bristlecone pine resistance to mountain pine beetle is likely to be retained through climate-driven high-elevation mountain pine beetle outbreaks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525208400000</updated><fingerprint>6d3dd63b</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196732</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196732</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196732</originId><author><name>Erika L.

The current push for rigor and reproducibility is driven by a desire for confidence in research results. Here, we suggest a framework for a systematic process, based on consensus principles of measurement science, to guide researchers and reviewers in assessing, documenting, and mitigating the sources of uncertainty in a study. All study results have associated ambiguities that are not always clarified by simply establishing reproducibility. By explicitly considering sources of uncertainty, noting aspects of the experimental system that are difficult to characterize quantitatively, and proposing alternative interpretations, the researcher provides information that enhances comparability and reproducibility.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/B-OvrhCl9FE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><fingerprint>df41aca3</fingerprint><engagement>3</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004299</link><title>How measurement science can improve confidence in research results</title><author><name>Anne L.

By explicitly considering sources of uncertainty, noting aspects of the experimental system that are difficult to characterize quantitatively, and proposing alternative interpretations, the researcher provides information that enhances comparability and reproducibility.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/B-OvrhCl9FE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/B-OvrhCl9FE/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>News at a glance</title><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33bb1:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Scientific Community</item></keywords><fingerprint>e51a2f8d</fingerprint><published>1525369184000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/468?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/468?rss=1</originId><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>3</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/468.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/468?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04933-4/d41586-018-04933-4_15713300.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height></visual><title>A visceral history of dinosaurs, the world through the nose of a dog and the psychological secrets of the plot twist: Books in brief</title><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162f807aeb7:692544d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1524579675831</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A visceral history of dinosaurs, the world through the nose of a dog and the psychological secrets of the plot twist: Books in brief&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A visceral history of dinosaurs, the world through the nose of a dog and the psychological secrets of the plot twist: Books in brief, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04933-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04933-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Barbara Kiser reviews five of the week’s best science picks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a86ae5f0</fingerprint><engagement>108</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04933-4</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04933-4</originId><author><name>Barbara Kiser</name></author><published>1524553200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A visceral history of dinosaurs, the world through the nose of a dog and the psychological secrets of the plot twist: Books in brief&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A visceral history of dinosaurs, the world through the nose of a dog and the psychological secrets of the plot twist: Books in brief, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04933-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04933-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Barbara Kiser reviews five of the week’s best science picks.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04933-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006071</originId><recrawled>1525369329029</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1632717282b:4969c1:a96d255</id><crawled>1525369219115</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paul A.

As the development of new classes of antibiotics slows, bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem. A potential solution is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth, anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial clearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule 7 coupled polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to host cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model consists of two physical compartments: the host cells and the exudate. It is found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the host cells and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the host cells into the exudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the bacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or continuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible. Lastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our mathematical model.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MQif6tb7BiM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><fingerprint>33dc99fb</fingerprint><engagement>1</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006071</link><title>Predictive modelling of a novel anti-adhesion therapy to combat bacterial colonisation of burn wounds</title><author><name>Paul A.

In these cases, CII functions as a fumarate reductase that accepts electrons from a low electron potential quinol, rhodoquinol (RQ). To clarify the origins of RQ-mediated fumarate reduction in eukaryotes, we investigated the origin and function of &lt;i&gt;rqua&lt;/i&gt;, a gene encoding an RQ biosynthetic enzyme. &lt;i&gt;Rqua&lt;/i&gt; is very patchily distributed across eukaryotes and bacteria adapted to hypoxia.

In these cases, CII functions as a fumarate reductase that accepts electrons from a low electron potential quinol, rhodoquinol (RQ). To clarify the origins of RQ-mediated fumarate reduction in eukaryotes, we investigated the origin and function of &lt;i&gt;rqua&lt;/i&gt;, a gene encoding an RQ biosynthetic enzyme. &lt;i&gt;Rqua&lt;/i&gt; is very patchily distributed across eukaryotes and bacteria adapted to hypoxia. Phylogenetic analyses suggest lateral gene transfer (LGT) of &lt;i&gt;rqua&lt;/i&gt; from bacteria to eukaryotes occurred at least twice and the gene was transferred multiple times amongst protists. We demonstrate that RQUA functions in the mitochondrion-related organelles of the anaerobic protist &lt;i&gt;Pygsuia&lt;/i&gt; and is correlated with the presence of RQ.

Plastic pollution has been well documented in natural environments, including the open waters and sediments within lakes and rivers, the open ocean and even the air, but less attention has been paid to synthetic polymers in human consumables. Since multiple toxicity studies indicate risks to human health when plastic particles are ingested, more needs to be known about the presence and abundance of anthropogenic particles in human foods and beverages. This study investigates the presence of anthropogenic particles in 159 samples of globally sourced tap water, 12 brands of Laurentian Great Lakes beer, and 12 brands of commercial sea salt. Of the tap water samples analyzed, 81% were found to contain anthropogenic particles. The majority of these particles were fibers (98.3%) between 0.1–5 mm in length. The range was 0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L. Anthropogenic debris was found in each brand of beer and salt. Of the extracted particles, over 99% were fibers. After adjusting for particles found in lab blanks for both salt and beer, the average number of particles found in beer was 4.05 particles/L with a range of 0 to 14.3 particles/L and the average number of particles found in each brand of salt was 212 particles/kg with a range of 46.7 to 806 particles/kg. Based on consumer guidelines, our results indicate the average person ingests over 5,800 particles of synthetic debris from these three sources annually, with the largest contribution coming from tap water (88%).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523480400000</updated><fingerprint>c135152e</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</originId><author><name>Mary Kosuth</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1523480400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mary Kosuth, Sherri A.

After adjusting for particles found in lab blanks for both salt and beer, the average number of particles found in beer was 4.05 particles/L with a range of 0 to 14.3 particles/L and the average number of particles found in each brand of salt was 212 particles/kg with a range of 46.7 to 806 particles/kg. Based on consumer guidelines, our results indicate the average person ingests over 5,800 particles of synthetic debris from these three sources annually, with the largest contribution coming from tap water (88%).</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>In vivo CRISPR screening unveils histone demethylase UTX as an important epigenetic regulator in lung tumorigenesis [Cell Biology]</title><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162f8a5b82f:6a632b5:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1524590032943</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.

Background &lt;p&gt;Preclinical breast cancer models recapitulating the clinical course of metastatic disease are crucial for drug development. Highly metastatic cell lines forming spontaneous metastasis following orthotopic implantation were previously developed and characterized regarding their biological and histological characteristics. This study aimed to non-invasively and longitudinally characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of metastasis formation and progression in the MDA-MB-231-derived triple negative LM2-4 and HER2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LM2-4H2N cell lines, using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), fluorescence imaging, and 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET).&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;LM2-4, LM2-4H2N, and MDA-MB-231 tumors were established in the right inguinal mammary fat pad (MFP) of female SCID mice and resected 14–16 days later. Metastasis formation was monitored using BLI. Metabolic activity of primary and metastatic lesions in mice bearing LM2-4 or LM2-4H2N was assessed by [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET. Metastatic burden at study endpoint was assessed by CT and fluorescence imaging following intravenous dual-modality liposome agent administration.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Comparable temporal metastasis patterns were observed using BLI for the highly metastatic cell lines LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N, while metastasis formed about 10 days later for MDA-MB-231. 21 days post primary tumor resection, metastases were detected in 86% of LM2-4, 69% of LM2-4H2N, and 60% of MDA-MB-231 inoculated mice, predominantly in the axillary region, contralateral MFP, and liver/lung. LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N tumors displayed high metabolism based on [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake.

Repeated concussion is becoming increasingly recognized as a serious public health concern around the world. Moreover, there is a greater awareness amongst health professionals of the potential for repeated pediatric concussions to detrimentally alter the structure and function of the developing brain. To better study this issue, we developed an awake closed head injury (ACHI) model that enabled repeated concussions to be performed reliably and reproducibly in juvenile rats. A neurological assessment protocol (NAP) score was generated immediately after each ACHI to help quantify the cumulative effects of repeated injury on level of consciousness, and basic motor and reflexive capacity. Here we show that we can produce a repeated ACHI (4 impacts in two days) in both male and female juvenile rats without significant mortality or pain. We show that both single and repeated injuries produce acute neurological deficits resembling clinical concussion symptoms that can be quantified using the NAP score. Behavioural analyses indicate repeated ACHI acutely impaired spatial memory in the Barnes maze, and an interesting sex effect was revealed as memory impairment correlated moderately with poorer NAP score performance in a subset of females. These cognitive impairments occurred in the absence of motor impairments on the Rotarod, or emotional changes in the open field and elevated plus mazes. Cresyl violet histology and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that repeated ACHI did not produce significant structural damage. MRI also confirmed there was no volumetric loss in the cortex, hippocampus, or corpus callosum of animals at 1 or 7 days post-ACHI. Together these data indicate that the ACHI model can provide a reliable, high throughput means to study the effects of concussions in juvenile rats.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>288c5762</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197187</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197187</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197187</originId><author><name>Alicia Meconi</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alicia Meconi, Ryan C.

If you live in the US, you’ve surely seen various cancer treatment centers talking about their personalized therapy plans, and especially how they’ll tailor things to your DNA sequence and so on. You would get the impression that we have an arsenal of specifically targeted cancer therapies, waiting for patients to get their tumors sequenced so they can be paired with the optimal treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not true. I wish it were, but it just isn’t. And I fear that a lot of patients and their families actually believe that it is, which can make for some bad decisions (both medically and financially). I can hardly blame them much, though, because for years now there’s been a ceaseless flow of stories in the press about targeted therapies, genomic sequencing of patients, breakthroughs, advances, new DNA this and advanced sequence that and on and on. I think it’s safe to say that the average patient does not have the time nor the expertise to keep up with the actual biomedical literature, and thus relies on headlines and advertisements for an impression of the field, and that impression is pretty far off of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; article, which covers a debate at the recent AACR meeting between David Hyman and Vinay Prasad, estimates that only about 15% of patients total are currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/precision-medicine/tumor-dna-sequencing&quot;&gt;even eligible&lt;/a&gt; (under FDA guidelines) to have their tumors sequenced in hope of matching with a targeted therapy. About one third-of those may actually benefit from the process in the end. This is not exactly what you’d expect if all you knew about this stuff was what you heard on TV. The thing is, that’s actually a great advance, because the number used to be zero, in both categories. We really are making progress, and the people who can benefit really can benefit. It’s just that there aren’t nearly as many of them as we’d like, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can’t pin this just on clueless news readers – even back in 2003, the head of the NCI (later head of the FDA, Andy Eschenbach) &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2012/02/23/remember_when_we_were_going_to_eliminate_deaths_from_cancer&quot;&gt;was talking&lt;/a&gt; about “eliminating death and suffering” due to cancer by. . .2015. We have missed that deadline. In 2006 (as that link shows), he was going on in a similar way about how we’d moved to a whole new level, everything had changed, etc. In general, whenever someone starts talking about “the next level” or something like that, I check to make sure my wallet is still in my pocket. This isn’t a game we’re working through – it doesn’t have “levels”, and in fact, not many large complicated real-world things do. Quantized jumps happen on the microscale. Up here, we’re grinding it out, and that’s how cancer therapy is advancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the confusion is that people have different ideas about what “precision targeting” in oncology really is. The term got applied early on to the wave of kinase inhibitors and so on that targeted particular cellular mechanisms (rather than just being wrecking balls like some of the earlier chemotherapy drugs), and that muddied things a bit. Some of the earlier successes in this area came about because some (relatively rare) tumor types really do seem to be pretty genetically homogeneous: they occur in pretty much the same way for the same reasons. So if you target that mechanism, you’re likely to see an effect; it’s like the situation in many human genetic disorders, and it doesn’t happen that way in cancer too often. But the high-profile successes against things like GIST confused some parts the public, I think, into thinking that the different bodily locations of cancer were all like that – genetically distinct from cancer in other organs, but very similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would that it were so. The second level of confusion comes to the DNA-sequencing aspect, which is at least closer to reality in terms of how cancer works, if not its treatment. “OK’, this story goes, “this patient has (something)oma, so let’s take some cells and see what variety of it they have so we can give them the drug that works against that subtype”. That’s what too many people think we have now, and what in a few cases we actually do (as above). But most of the time we don’t really understand what’s going on at a cellular level, as gets proven every time another promising oncology mechanism wipes out in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even with those successes, there’s room to wonder how far this idea can be pushed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/12/precision-oncology-isnt-quite-there-yet&quot;&gt;Here’s a piece on that&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 (more Vinay Prasad), wondering just how precise it’s possible to get. One big problem is that many solid tumors are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/08/16/cancer_cells_too_unstable_for_fine_targeting&quot;&gt;terrible mixture&lt;/a&gt; of cell types. They generally got that way by being &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/20/glioblastoma-is-bad-news-period&quot;&gt;genomically unstable&lt;/a&gt;, and that unstability just goes on and on. That’s where all this fine targeting really runs into trouble: what if a given patient’s tumor is a mixture of eight or nine different cellular forms of cancer? Well, eight or nine that you know about so far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s one reason that immuno-oncology is such a hot field, because (to a first approximation) it’s saying “OK, we don’t know how all you cells became cancerous and we don’t care. We can set it up so that (for example) you all get recognized by killer T cells, and they will take you out no matter what your pedigree”. Problem is, we’re not quite to this stage for all but a very few forms of cancer. By far the most successful are blood-based cancers like leukemia, where the cells really are quite similar to each other by oncology standards, giving you a chance to wipe them out &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;. Getting that to happen for solid tumors is. . .not so easy. The more successful immuno-oncology for solid tumors, so far, is using antibodies to go after potential common mechanisms like PD-L1 that are fending off such T-cell attack, but (a) we don’t have such markers for most solid tumors, and (b) in many cases, the most we can do now, usually, is to wipe out most of of a patient’s tumors (best case) leaving behind an untouched residue of mutated cells that eventually comes back in untreatable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not putting that down at all – this can buy people substantial more life, although not always. In every case, you have to see (with real-world clinical data) how much actual survival you’ve been able to achieve. That’s another big reason that we missed that absurd 2015 date, because it takes years to figure out just how well these therapies actually work in practice. It’s a slog, and I don’t see any way for it not to be a slog, and it’s too bad that that doesn’t make for a very compelling slogan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>bcdc41c9</fingerprint><keywords><item>Cancer</item><item>Clinical Trials</item><item>Drug Development</item><item>Drug Industry History</item><item>Press Coverage</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/02/cancer-sequencing-hype-and-reality</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><summary><content>This piece in Science says something that needs to be said louder and more publicly.

The polymorphisms at the α-chain of the IL-7 receptor (&lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt;) have been related to T-cell homeostasis and development and may contribute to immune system deregulation. In the present study, we analyzed the association between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms and the progression of liver fibrosis in patients infected with HCV. We carried out a retrospective study with a design consisting of repeated measurements in 187 HCV-infected patients, to study the risk prediction of liver fibrosis progression using genetic factors. We genotyped the rs6897932, rs987106 and rs3194051 &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms using the Agena Bioscience’s MassARRAY. Transient elastography was used to measure liver stiffness. The used cut-offs were: &amp;lt;7.1 kPa (F0-F1), 7.1–9.4 kPa (F2; significant fibrosis), 9.5-12.4 kPa (F3; advanced fibrosis), and ≥12.5 kPa (F4; cirrhosis). All HCV genotypes were analyzed. The median of follow-up time was 47.9 months. Baseline liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values did not show significant statistical differences for &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes (p&gt;0.05). In univariate analysis, the rs6897932 T allele had a positive relationship with an increase in LSM (arithmetic mean ratio (AMR) = 1.21 (95%CI = 1.08; 1.36); p = 0.001), progression to advanced fibrosis (F≥3) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.51 (95%CI = 1.29; 4.88); p = 0.006) and progression to cirrhosis (F4) (OR = 2.71 (95%CI = 0.94; 5.03); p = 0.069). In multivariable analysis, the rs6897932 T allele was related to a higher increase of LSM values during follow-up (adjusted AMR = 1.27 (95%CI = 1.13; 1.42); p&amp;lt;0.001) and higher odds of progression to advanced fibrosis [adjusted OR = 4.46 (95%CI = 1.87; 10.62); p = 0.001], and progression to cirrhosis [adjusted OR = 3.92 (95%CI = 1.30; 11.77); p = 0.015]. Regarding &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and rs3194051 polymorphisms, we did not find significant results except for the relationship between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and the increase in LSM values [adjusted OR = 1.12 (95%CI = 1.02; 1.23); p = 0.015]. The &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs6897932 polymorphism seems to be related to increased risk of liver fibrosis progression in HCV-infected patients. Thus, the rs6897932 polymorphism could be related to the physiopathology of CHC and might be used to successfully stratify the risk of CHC progression.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>108de5b9</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197115</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197115</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197115</originId><author><name>María Ángeles Jiménez-Sousa</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by María Ángeles Jiménez-Sousa, Ana Zaida Gómez-Moreno, Daniel Pineda-Tenor, Luz Maria Medrano, Juan José Sánchez-Ruano, Amanda Fernández-Rodríguez, Tomas Artaza-Varasa, José Saura-Montalbán, Sonia Vázquez-Morón, Pablo Ryan, Salvador Resino&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, the rs6897932 polymorphism could be related to the physiopathology of CHC and might be used to successfully stratify the risk of CHC progression.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197115</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Author Correction: Lateral attachment of kinetochores to microtubules is enriched in prometaphase rosette and facilitates chromosome alignment and bi-orientation establishment</title><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16315a17e6b:1c8df47:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1525076295275</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Lateral attachment of kinetochores to microtubules is enriched in prometaphase rosette and facilitates chromosome alignment and bi-orientation establishment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Lateral attachment of kinetochores to microtubules is enriched in prometaphase rosette and facilitates chromosome alignment and bi-orientation establishment, Published online: 30 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25175-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25175-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Lateral attachment of kinetochores to microtubules is enriched in prometaphase rosette and facilitates chromosome alignment and bi-orientation establishment&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/DlvM4PNmvUs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>cd186586</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25175-4</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25175-4</originId><author><name>Go Itoh</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25175-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1525071600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Lateral attachment of kinetochores to microtubules is enriched in prometaphase rosette and facilitates chromosome alignment and bi-orientation establishment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Lateral attachment of kinetochores to microtubules is enriched in prometaphase rosette and facilitates chromosome alignment and bi-orientation establishment, Published online: 30 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25175-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25175-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Lateral attachment of kinetochores to microtubules is enriched in prometaphase rosette and facilitates chromosome alignment and bi-orientation establishment&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/DlvM4PNmvUs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/DlvM4PNmvUs/s41598-018-25175-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00200/20180418/images/medium/bi-2018-00200v_0008.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>289</height></visual><title>[ASAP] Evolution of a Thermophilic Strand-Displacing Polymerase Using High-Temperature Isothermal Compartmentalized Self-Replication</title><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_162da736d52:c89ea8:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1524083420498</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>997b53ee</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00200/20180418/images/medium/bi-2018-00200v_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00200&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Currently, information on nearshore reef-associated fisheries is frequently disparate or incomplete, creating a challenge for effective management. This study utilized an existing non-commercial fishery dataset from Hawaiʻi, covering the period 2004–13, to estimate a variety of fundamental fishery parameters, including participation, effort, gear use, and catch per unit effort. We then used those data to reconstruct total catches per island. Non-commercial fisheries in this case comprise recreational, subsistence, and cultural harvest, which may be exchanged, but are not sold. By combining those data with reported commercial catch data, we estimated annual catch of nearshore reef-associated fisheries in the main Hawaiian Islands over the study period to be 1,167,758 ± 43,059 kg year&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (mean ± standard error). Average annual commercial reef fish catch over the same time period—184,911 kg year&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—was 16% of the total catch, but that proportion varied greatly among islands, ranging from 23% on Oʻahu to 5% on Molokaʻi. These results emphasize the importance of reef fishing in Hawaiʻi for reasons beyond commerce, such as food security and cultural practice, and highlight the large differences in fishing practices across the Hawaiian Islands.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><fingerprint>7ed2156e</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195840</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195840</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195840</originId><author><name>Kaylyn S.

Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive nucleotide sequences that make up a large portion of eukaryotic genomes. They can move and duplicate within a genome, increasing genome size and contributing to genetic diversity within and across species. Accurate identification and classification of TEs present in a genome is an important step towards understanding their effects on genes and their role in genome evolution. We introduce TE-Learner, a framework based on machine learning that automatically identifies TEs in a given genome and assigns a classification to them. We present an implementation of our framework towards LTR retrotransposons, a particular type of TEs characterized by having long terminal repeats (LTRs) at their boundaries. We evaluate the predictive performance of our framework on the well-annotated genomes of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and we compare our results for three LTR retrotransposon superfamilies with the results of three widely used methods for TE identification or classification: RepeatMasker, Censor and LtrDigest.

Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive nucleotide sequences that make up a large portion of eukaryotic genomes. They can move and duplicate within a genome, increasing genome size and contributing to genetic diversity within and across species. Accurate identification and classification of TEs present in a genome is an important step towards understanding their effects on genes and their role in genome evolution. We introduce TE-Learner, a framework based on machine learning that automatically identifies TEs in a given genome and assigns a classification to them. We present an implementation of our framework towards LTR retrotransposons, a particular type of TEs characterized by having long terminal repeats (LTRs) at their boundaries. We evaluate the predictive performance of our framework on the well-annotated genomes of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and we compare our results for three LTR retrotransposon superfamilies with the results of three widely used methods for TE identification or classification: RepeatMasker, Censor and LtrDigest. In contrast to these methods, TE-Learner is the first to incorporate machine learning techniques, outperforming these methods in terms of predictive performance, while able to learn models and make predictions efficiently. Moreover, we show that our method was able to identify TEs that none of the above method could find, and we investigated TE-Learner’s predictions which did not correspond to an official annotation. It turns out that many of these predictions are in fact strongly homologous to a known TE.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WmOp0oT-h9c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/WmOp0oT-h9c/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Multiple large-scale gene and genome duplications during the evolution of hexapods [Evolution]</title><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1631d51f359:2877c6c:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1525205300057</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>Polyploidy or whole genome duplication (WGD) is a major contributor to genome evolution and diversity.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of infection and poorer responses to vaccination. This suggests that CKD patients have an impaired responsiveness to all antigens, even those first encountered before CKD onset. To examine this we evaluated antibody responses against two childhood vaccine antigens, tetanus (TT) and diphtheria toxoids (DT) and two common pathogens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Enteritidis (SEn) in two independent cohorts consisting of age-matched individuals with and without CKD. Sera were evaluated for antigen-specific IgG titres and the functionality of antibody to SEn was assessed in a serum bactericidal assay. Surprisingly, patients with CKD and control subjects had comparable levels of IgG against TT and DT, suggesting preserved humoral memory responses to antigens encountered early in life. Lipopolysaccharide-specific IgG titres and serum bactericidal activity in patients with CKD were also not inferior to controls. CMV-specific IgG titres in seropositive CKD patients were similar or even increased compared to controls. Therefore, whilst responses to new vaccines in CKD are typically lower than expected, antibody responses to antigens commonly encountered prior to CKD onset are not. The immunodeficiency of CKD is likely characterised by failure to respond to new antigenic challenges and efforts to improve patient outcomes should be focussed here.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><fingerprint>939ee3f</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195730</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195730</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195730</originId><author><name>Nadezhda A.

A pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-specific receptor, PAC1R, is coupled with multiple signal transduction pathways including stimulation of adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. PAC1R has been shown to exert its long-lasting and potent signals via β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. However, the precise roles of the two β-arrestin isoforms in PACAP-PAC1R signaling remain unclear. Here we examined the interaction between the two β-arrestin isoforms and PAC1R, β-arrestin-dependent PAC1R subcellular localization and ERK1/2 activation. Upon PACAP stimulation, although PAC1R similarly interacted with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in HEK293T cells, the complex of PAC1R and β-arrestin2 was translocated from the cell surface into cytosol, but that of β-arrestin1 remained in the cell surface regions in HeLa cells and mouse primary cultured neurons. Silencing of β-arrestin2 blocked PACAP-induced PAC1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but silencing of β-arrestin1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><fingerprint>baacc1f2</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</originId><author><name>Yusuke Shintani</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525726800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yusuke Shintani, Atsuko Hayata-Takano, Keita Moriguchi, Takanobu Nakazawa, Yukio Ago, Atsushi Kasai, Kaoru Seiriki, Norihito Shintani, Hitoshi Hashimoto&lt;/p&gt;
A pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-specific receptor, PAC1R, is coupled with multiple signal transduction pathways including stimulation of adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. PAC1R has been shown to exert its long-lasting and potent signals via β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. However, the precise roles of the two β-arrestin isoforms in PACAP-PAC1R signaling remain unclear. Here we examined the interaction between the two β-arrestin isoforms and PAC1R, β-arrestin-dependent PAC1R subcellular localization and ERK1/2 activation. Upon PACAP stimulation, although PAC1R similarly interacted with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in HEK293T cells, the complex of PAC1R and β-arrestin2 was translocated from the cell surface into cytosol, but that of β-arrestin1 remained in the cell surface regions in HeLa cells and mouse primary cultured neurons. Silencing of β-arrestin2 blocked PACAP-induced PAC1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but silencing of β-arrestin1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Extracting neuronal functional network dynamics via adaptive Granger causality analysis [Applied Mathematics]</title><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162f8a5b82f:6a632c1:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1524590032943</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>Quantifying the functional relations between the nodes in a network based on local observations is a key challenge in studying complex systems.

The relapse of nasal deformity is a challenge for modern correction of cleft lip. A comprehensive understanding in the biomechanical perspective of both the formation and correction of the cleft lip nasal deformity would lead to improved stability of the corrective outcome. In this study, a finite element model of secondary cleft lip nasal deformity was constructed, on which two critical corrective maneuvers were mimicked in the form of force-loading. The intercrural suture was simulated by a force loaded at the intermediate crus of the alar cartilage directing anteriorly and medially, and the suture suspending the alar cartilage to the upper lateral cartilage was simulated by a force loaded at the lateral crus directing superiorly and medially. The equivalent von-mises stress and the total deformation consequent to different patterns of loading were captured. Our biomechanical analyses suggested that the intercrural suture at the nasal tip might be more effective in generating widespread morphological change than the suspension suture, but left much higher level of stress within the skin envelope if placed too high. Synergistic effect was observed between the two sutures in both the resultant deformation and stress. In addition, our simulations were partially supported by clinical photogrammetry data.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523653200000</updated><fingerprint>940c8d61</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195583</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195583</originId><author><name>Hanyao Huang</name></author><published>1523653200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanyao Huang, Yeping Li, Xiangyou Luo, Xu Cheng, Bing Shi, Jingtao Li&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, our simulations were partially supported by clinical photogrammetry data.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195583</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Splitting the World with Absolute Measurements: A Call for Collaborations in Physical Biology</title><id>9eIPIKV4kOcW5lEUHqUkf3UaeBlngqwYuFsoLusj66Y=_1630293e657:2a9b66:4e164c41</id><crawled>1524756637271</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>2f9e1c79</fingerprint><published>1524756248000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/24054712</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell Systems</title></origin><summary><content>Publication date: &lt;span&gt;25 April 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell Systems, Volume 6, Issue 4&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Quincey Justman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301467%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D1bc070c14971ed6a563e495ff4ec721d</link><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301467%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D1bc070c14971ed6a563e495ff4ec721d</originId><author><name>NA</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471218301467</canonicalUrl><description>Publication date: &lt;span&gt;25 April 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell Systems, Volume 6, Issue 4&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Quincey Justman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301467%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D1bc070c14971ed6a563e495ff4ec721d</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Evaluation of the fusion inhibitor P3 peptide as a potential microbicide to prevent HIV transmission in women</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccb1:34f43e70</id><crawled>1524073508287</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Inês Bártolo, Ana Rita Diniz, Pedro Borrego, João Pedro Ferreira, Maria Rosário Bronze, Helena Barroso, Rui Pinto, Carlos Cardoso, João F.

Microbicides are an important strategy for preventing the sexual transmission of HIV but, so far, the most advanced tenofovir-based microbicides have had modest efficacy. This has been related to adherence problems and high prevalence of tenofovir-resistant HIV-1 strains. P3 is a new peptide with potent activity against HIV that may be a good microbicide candidate. In this work P3 was formulated in a gel of hydroxyethyl cellulose and its activity, stability and safety profile in Balb/c mice were evaluated. HIV infection was fully blocked by a 1.5% gel containing P3 at the IC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; (366.4 nM) concentration. The antiviral activity did not change at 4°C during 4 months and at 25, 37 and 65°C for 1 week. P3 was stable and fully functional at acidic pH up to 24h, under different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and in the presence of genital fluids up to 48h. P3 had no antibacterial activity and did not affect sperm motility and vitality. Finally, P3 didn’t cause significant alterations in the vaginal epithelium of Balb/c mice at 0.06 (456.8 μM) and 0.2 mg/day (1522.7 μM) doses. These findings indicate that P3 is an excellent candidate for further development as a microbicide gel for the prevention of HIV transmission in women.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><fingerprint>c50e618d</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195744</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195744</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195744</originId><author><name>Inês Bártolo</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524085200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inês Bártolo, Ana Rita Diniz, Pedro Borrego, João Pedro Ferreira, Maria Rosário Bronze, Helena Barroso, Rui Pinto, Carlos Cardoso, João F.

d-Tagatose has gained substantial interest due to its potential functionalities as a sucrose substitute. In this study, the gene &lt;i&gt;araA&lt;/i&gt;, encoding l-arabinose isomerase (l-AI) from &lt;i&gt;Clostridium hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; (DSM 15053), was cloned and expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; BL21 (DE3). This gene consists of 1,506 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 501 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 56,554 Da. Since l-AI was expressed as an intracellular inclusion body, this enzyme was solubilized with guanidine hydrochloride, refolded, and activated with a descending concentration gradient of urea. The purified enzyme exhibited the greatest activity at 50°C, pH 7–7.5, and required 1 mM of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a cofactor. Notably, the catalytic efficiency (3.69 mM&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) of l-AI from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; on galactose was significantly greater than that of other previously reported enzymes. The bioconversion yield of d-tagatose using the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; l-arabinose isomerase at 60°C reached approximately 46% from 10 mM of d-galactose after 2 h. From these results, it is suggested that the l-arabinose isomerase from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; could be utilized as a potential enzyme for d-tagatose production due to its high conversion yield at an industrially competitive temperature.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><fingerprint>afe65d58</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</originId><author><name>Tien-Kieu Nguyen</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524517200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tien-Kieu Nguyen, Moon-Gi Hong, Pahn-Shick Chang, Byung-Hoo Lee, Sang-Ho Yoo&lt;/p&gt;

Inflammation causes nociceptive sensory neuron activation, evoking debilitating symptoms and reflexes. Inflammatory signaling pathways are capable of modulating mitochondrial function, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization and calcium release. Previously we showed that mitochondrial modulation with antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor, selectively stimulated nociceptive bronchopulmonary C-fibers via the activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 (A1) and vanilloid 1 (V1) cation channels. TRPA1 is ROS-sensitive, but there is little evidence that TRPV1 is activated by ROS. Here, we used dual imaging of dissociated vagal neurons to investigate the correlation of mitochondrial superoxide production (mitoSOX) or mitochondrial depolarization (JC-1) with cytosolic calcium (Fura-2AM), following mitochondrial modulation by antimycin A, rotenone (complex I inhibitor) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, mitochondrial uncoupling agent). Mitochondrial modulation by all agents selectively increased cytosolic calcium in a subset of TRPA1/TRPV1-expressing (A1/V1+) neurons. There was a significant correlation between antimycin A-induced calcium responses and mitochondrial superoxide in wild-type ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons, which was eliminated in TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Nevertheless, antimycin A-induced superoxide production did not always increase calcium in A1/V1+ neurons, suggesting a critical role of an unknown factor. CCCP caused both superoxide production and mitochondrial depolarization but neither correlated with calcium fluxes in A1/V1+ neurons. Rotenone-induced calcium responses in ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons correlated with mitochondrial depolarization but not superoxide production. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction causes calcium fluxes in a subset of A1/V1+ neurons via ROS-dependent and ROS-independent mechanisms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><fingerprint>b90d5f19</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197106</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197106</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197106</originId><author><name>Katherine R.

State-of-the-art light-sheet and confocal microscopes allow recording of entire embryos in 3D and over time (3D+t) for many hours. Fluorescently labeled structures can be segmented and tracked automatically in these terabyte-scale 3D+t images, resulting in thousands of cell migration trajectories that provide detailed insights to large-scale tissue reorganization at the cellular level. Here we present EmbryoMiner, a new interactive open-source framework suitable for in-depth analyses and comparisons of entire embryos, including an extensive set of trajectory features. Starting at the whole-embryo level, the framework can be used to iteratively focus on a region of interest within the embryo, to investigate and test specific trajectory-based hypotheses and to extract quantitative features from the isolated trajectories. Thus, the new framework provides a valuable new way to quantitatively compare corresponding anatomical regions in different embryos that were manually selected based on biological prior knowledge. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 3D+t light-sheet microscopy images of zebrafish embryos, showcasing potential user applications that can be performed using the new framework.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fPwmNSZz3xw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524171600000</updated><fingerprint>458589a7</fingerprint><engagement>1</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006128</link><title>EmbryoMiner: A new framework for interactive knowledge discovery in large-scale cell tracking data of developing embryos</title><author><name>Benjamin Schott</name></author><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006128</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1524171600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Schott, Manuel Traub, Cornelia Schlagenhauf, Masanari Takamiya, Thomas Antritter, Andreas Bartschat, Katharina Löffler, Denis Blessing, Jens C.

We investigated the impacts of the Mount Polley tailings impoundment failure on chemical, physical, and microbial properties of substrates within the affected watershed, comprised of 70 hectares of riparian wetlands and 40 km of stream and lake shore. We established a biomonitoring network in October of 2014, two months following the disturbance, and evaluated riparian and wetland substrates for microbial community composition and function via 16S and full metagenome sequencing. A total of 234 samples were collected from substrates at 3 depths and 1,650,752 sequences were recorded in a geodatabase framework. These data revealed a wealth of information regarding watershed-scale distribution of microbial community members, as well as community composition, structure, and response to disturbance. Substrates associated with the impact zone were distinct chemically as indicated by elevated pH, nitrate, and sulphate. The microbial community exhibited elevated metabolic capacity for selenate and sulfate reduction and an abundance of chemolithoautotrophs in the &lt;i&gt;Thiobacillus thiophilus/T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;denitrificans/T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thioparus&lt;/i&gt; clade that may contribute to nitrate attenuation within the affected watershed. The most impacted area (a 6 km stream connecting two lakes) exhibited 30% lower microbial diversity relative to the remaining sites. The tailings impoundment failure at Mount Polley Mine has provided a unique opportunity to evaluate functional and compositional diversity soon after a major catastrophic disturbance to assess metabolic potential for ecosystem recovery.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524690000000</updated><fingerprint>40cd0e72</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196032</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196032</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196032</originId><author><name>Heath W.

The tailings impoundment failure at Mount Polley Mine has provided a unique opportunity to evaluate functional and compositional diversity soon after a major catastrophic disturbance to assess metabolic potential for ecosystem recovery.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196032</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23840-2/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23840_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>508</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height></visual><title>Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-Ras transformed human mammary epithelial cells</title><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162f1d1745e:5d8411b:34f43e70</id><crawled>1524475458654</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&lt;i&gt;Ras&lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&amp;lt;i&gt;Ras&amp;lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23840-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23840-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&lt;i&gt;Ras&lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ZDUJHhIumw4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c930ccfc</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23840-2</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23840-2</originId><author><name>Young-Il Hahn</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23840-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1524466800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&lt;i&gt;Ras&lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&amp;lt;i&gt;Ras&amp;lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23840-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23840-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-&lt;i&gt;Ras&lt;/i&gt; transformed human mammary epithelial cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ZDUJHhIumw4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/ZDUJHhIumw4/s41598-018-23840-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00124/20180507/images/medium/jm-2018-00124v_0016.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>237</height></visual><title>[ASAP] NAD(P)H:Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) as a Therapeutic and Diagnostic Target in Cancer</title><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_1633b7d29fd:da524f:abeb7260</id><crawled>1525711448573</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>54758331</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00124/20180507/images/medium/jm-2018-00124v_0016.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00124&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

In mountainous landscapes, soil moisture is highly dynamic due to the effects of topography and the temporal variability imposed by seasonal precipitation, including rainfall and snow. Soil moisture is known to affect ecosystem carbon exchange both aboveground and belowground, as well as the stable isotopic composition of exchanged CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this study we used an extensive suite of measurements to examine the effects of seasonal changes in soil moisture on the isotopic composition of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production at the landscape level. We show that the seasonal decline in soil moisture (i.e., summer dry-down) appeared to impose a trend in the δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) with more negative δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; early in the growing season when soils were wet, and more positive δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; as the growing season progressed and soils dried out. This seemingly generalizable pattern for a snow-dominated watershed is likely to represent the variability of recently assimilated C, tracked through the plant-soil system and imprinted in the respired CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

p73 is a member of the p53 protein family and has essential functions in several signaling pathways involved in development, differentiation, DNA damage responses and cancer. As a transcription factor, p73 achieves these functions by binding to consensus DNA sequences and p73 shares at least partial target DNA binding sequence specificity with p53. Transcriptional activation by p73 has been demonstrated for more than fifty p53 targets in yeast and/or human cancer cell lines. It has also been shown previously that p53 binding to DNA is strongly dependent on DNA topology and the presence of inverted repeats that can form DNA cruciforms, but whether p73 transcriptional activity has similar dependence has not been investigated. Therefore, we evaluated p73 binding to a set of p53-response elements with identical theoretical binding affinity in their linear state, but different probabilities to form extra helical structures. We show by a yeast-based assay that transactivation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; correlated more with the relative propensity of a response element to form cruciforms than to its expected &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; DNA binding affinity.

Extra macrochaetae (Emc) forms inactive heterodimers with both proneural bHLH proteins and their bHLH partners (represented in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; by Daughterless). It is generally thought that varying levels of Emc define a prepattern that determines where proneural bHLH genes can be effective. We report that instead it is the bHLH proteins that determine the pattern of Emc levels. Daughterless level sets Emc protein levels in most cells, apparently by stabilizing Emc in heterodimers.

Extra macrochaetae (Emc) forms inactive heterodimers with both proneural bHLH proteins and their bHLH partners (represented in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; by Daughterless). It is generally thought that varying levels of Emc define a prepattern that determines where proneural bHLH genes can be effective. We report that instead it is the bHLH proteins that determine the pattern of Emc levels. Daughterless level sets Emc protein levels in most cells, apparently by stabilizing Emc in heterodimers. Emc is destabilized in proneural regions by local competition for heterodimer formation by proneural bHLH proteins including Atonal or AS-C proteins. Reflecting this post-translational control through protein stability, uniform &lt;i&gt;emc&lt;/i&gt; transcription is sufficient for almost normal patterns of neurogenesis.

&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium abscessus&lt;/i&gt;, a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium, are increasingly present in soft tissue infections and chronic lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, and infections are characterized by growth in neutrophil-rich environments. &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; is observed as two distinct smooth and rough morphotypes.

Background &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to conduct an indirect treatment comparison between cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel relative to comparators in the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who progress on docetaxel-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the network meta-analysis of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Due to a lack of head-to-head trials, studies with a comparator arm of best supportive care were included in the analysis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events were compared within both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks. The ratios for survival outcomes were estimated using hazard ratios (HR), and the ratios for adverse events between groups were estimated using odds ratios (ORs); uncertainty was reported as 95% confidence (Frequentist) and credible (Baysesian) Intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three of thirteen trials identified for abstraction were relevant for analyses. Median overall survival was not statistically significantly different for abiraterone (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.83–1.28) or enzalutamide (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.69–1.11) when compared to cabazitaxel in the Bayesian analysis. Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01–10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI = 1.41–75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03–10.09) were more likely to occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14–206.40). Frequentist analyses produced similar results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The scarcity of clinical studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles. As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the beneficial effects of these therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523480400000</updated><fingerprint>1d131747</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195790</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195790</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195790</originId><author><name>Jon P.

This work aims at corroborating the importance and efficacy of mutual learning in motor imagery (MI) brain–computer interface (BCI) by leveraging the insights obtained through our participation in the BCI race of the Cybathlon event. We hypothesized that, contrary to the popular trend of focusing mostly on the machine learning aspects of MI BCI training, a comprehensive mutual learning methodology that reinstates the three learning pillars (at the machine, subject, and application level) as equally significant could lead to a BCI–user symbiotic system able to succeed in real-world scenarios such as the Cybathlon event. Two severely impaired participants with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), were trained following our mutual learning approach to control their avatar in a virtual BCI race game. The competition outcomes substantiate the effectiveness of this type of training. Most importantly, the present study is one among very few to provide multifaceted evidence on the efficacy of subject learning during BCI training. Learning correlates could be derived at all levels of the interface—application, BCI output, and electroencephalography (EEG) neuroimaging—with two end-users, sufficiently longitudinal evaluation, and, importantly, under real-world and even adverse conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/XSdFB8wknvs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>55657e49</fingerprint><engagement>25</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003787</link><title>The Cybathlon BCI race: Successful longitudinal mutual learning with two tetraplegic users</title><engagementRate>1.92</engagementRate><author><name>Serafeim Perdikis</name></author><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003787</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1525986000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Serafeim Perdikis, Luca Tonin, Sareh Saeedi, Christoph Schneider, José del R.

Learning correlates could be derived at all levels of the interface—application, BCI output, and electroencephalography (EEG) neuroimaging—with two end-users, sufficiently longitudinal evaluation, and, importantly, under real-world and even adverse conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/XSdFB8wknvs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/XSdFB8wknvs/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Cancer-killing viruses show promise — and draw billion-dollar investment</title><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163405e22d0:39eb78:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525793301200</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cancer-killing viruses show promise — and draw billion-dollar investment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer-killing viruses show promise — and draw billion-dollar investment, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05104-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05104-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Encouraging trial results spur interest from researchers and drug giants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>426c8a7d</fingerprint><engagement>157</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05104-1</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05104-1</originId><engagementRate>1.11</engagementRate><author><name>Heidi Ledford</name></author><published>1525762800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cancer-killing viruses show promise — and draw billion-dollar investment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer-killing viruses show promise — and draw billion-dollar investment, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05104-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05104-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Encouraging trial results spur interest from researchers and drug giants.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05104-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13451</originId><recrawled>1523536742806</recrawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162b50dec07:5ff82a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523456011271</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Here are some sequels to stories I’ve written about here, things that have had some new chapters added to them. First off, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/17/approvals-and-otherwise-in-oncology&quot;&gt;this 2015 post&lt;/a&gt; mentions the steep drop in shares of Clovis Biotechnology, brought on by a rather sudden revision in the announced clinical performance of their lead drug (the covalent kinase inhibitor rociletinib). Well, it appears that the SEC found this to be rather abrupt as well, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/more-than-2-years-after-the-ugly-roci-debacle-clovis-says-that-the-sec-is-prepping-civil-charges/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endpts&lt;/em&gt; now reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company has been under investigation. Some of their investors have long claimed that the presentation of the clinical data had been manipulated in order to keep the company’s stock price up, and it looks like that theory is getting a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth remembering the different time scales involved. Think of the different parts of a cell: you get fast service from receptors and second-messenger systems (starting on a time scale of less than a second), but if you’re waiting for proteins to be synthesized, you need to come back in a few hours. Likewise the stock market reacts pretty quickly to bad news (Clovis got sold off on that news as if the shares were giving off radon gas), but the regulatory authorities are much slower. That said, they’re also pretty hard to dislodge once they get a fix on your position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the markets can take a while to react to things, too, because it’s differences of opinion that make them work in the first place. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/07/30/another_alzheimers_ipo&quot;&gt;Here’s another post&lt;/a&gt; from 2015 where I wrote about the IPO of a company (vTv Therapeutics, formerly TransTech) trying to make a go of it with a retread Alzheimer’s therapy. The comparison with Axovant was obvious at the time, and some readers will recall &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/09/27/bad-news-but-not-the-unexpected-kind&quot;&gt;what eventually happened to them&lt;/a&gt; when their own drug failed yet again in an Alzheimer’s trial. As that post mentioned, I was short Axovant stock when that took place (an event that financed the purchase of a new 18-inch Dobsonian telescope around here). Well, vTv &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xconomy.com/raleigh-durham/2018/04/09/with-alzheimers-failure-vtv-fares-no-better-than-old-partner-pfizer/&quot;&gt;announced their own clinical trial results&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, and to no one’s particular surprise, the compound failed for them, just as it had for Pfizer back in the day when TransTech had licensed it to them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s stock had been up over $7 earlier in the year, on what I thought was rather misplaced optimism. I sold them short in January at $7.42, and have been careful not to write about them in any way since doing so (in fact, I haven’t mentioned them at all since that 2015 post). VTVT &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/vtvt?p=vtvt&quot;&gt;had been dropping&lt;/a&gt; since then, and was back down in the $3 range before they announced this news, but that failed trial sent them down steeply. At that point I naturally covered my position, which is one reason I mention it now. The stock is trading this morning at about $0.67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know, if someone else comes along with a drug that’s already failed one or two Alzheimer’s trials, I’m very likely to short them, too. One of these days some odd AD mechanism is (I hope) going to work, but given the odds of clinical success, financing things like Axovant’s or vTv’s drugs that have &lt;em&gt;already failed in the clinic&lt;/em&gt; seems like a bad idea. And that’s the other reason I’m bringing up my short sales of these companies: I (and the other people who were also short these outfits) should actually not be handed such opportunities. Axovant and vTv should not, in a more rational market, have been able to go public as blithely as they did with the assets that they had, and their market caps should not have achieved what heights they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great time to finance small biopharma companies (and here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LifeSciVC/status/983763134090530816&quot;&gt;a series of Twitter posts&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Booth with some good advice on that subject). But with all this money sloshing around, some of it (as always under these conditions) is going into some rather stupid ideas. &lt;em&gt;Caveat investor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>746a2be0</fingerprint><keywords><item>Alzheimer&apos;s Disease</item><item>Business and Markets</item><item>Cancer</item><item>Clinical Trials</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/11/bad-investments</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><summary><content>Here are some sequels to stories I’ve written about here, things that have had some new chapters added to them.

Leaf traits of native and exotic woody species in a New Zealand forest</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a18c:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Recent studies have concluded that native and invasive species share a common set of trait relationships. However, native species in isolated regions might be functionally constrained by their unique evolutionary histories such that they follow different carbon capture strategies than introduced species. We compared leaf traits relating to resource investment, carbon return, and resource-use efficiency in 16 native (endemic) and three non-native (invasive) species in a temperate forest in Canterbury, South Island, New Zealand. Trait differences were more closely associated with leaf habit than nativity. Deciduous species (including invaders) exhibited greater maximum photosynthetic rates at similar resource costs, which resulted in greater nitrogen- and energy-use efficiencies than evergreen natives. Leaf area was the only trait that differed significantly by nativity (over two-fold larger in invaders). Invaders and deciduous natives both occupied the ‘fast return’ end of the leaf economics spectrum in contrast to the native evergreens which had comparatively slow return on investment. Dominant woody invaders in this forest are physiologically distinct from many New Zealand endemic species, which are overwhelmingly evergreen. It remains unclear whether these trait differences translate to an ecological divergence in plant strategy, but these results suggest that ecophysiological tradeoffs are likely constrained by biogeography.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><fingerprint>89cd73b8</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196746</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196746</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196746</originId><author><name>J.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), is a transcription factor that governs pathways, such as lipid metabolism and immune response, that have been implicated in the etiology of LOAD. Previously, we established HepG2-derived cell-lines with stable knockdown of PPARγ gene, and showed an increase in mRNA levels of genes mapped in the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; linkage disequilibrium (LD) region on chromosome 19q13.32, with the greatest effect observed for &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;-mRNA. Here, we extended the analysis using our &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown model system and investigated the broader effect on expression changes of genes implicated in LOAD via genome wide association studies (GWAS). We applied the nCounter gene expression assay (NanoString) using a panel of twenty-four LOAD-associated genes inferred by proximity to the top significantly associated SNPs. Two independent &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown cell-lines showed changes in mRNA levels of a total of seven genes compared to a control HepG2 cell-line; six of which, &lt;i&gt;ABCA7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CASS4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CELF1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PTK2B&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ZCWPW1&lt;/i&gt;, were upregulated and one, &lt;i&gt;DSG2&lt;/i&gt;, was downregulated upon &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. Our results propose that &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; may act as a master regulator of the transcription of several genes involved in LOAD pathogenesis.

Visual estimation of the material and shape of an object from a single image includes a hard ill-posed computational problem. However, in our daily life we feel we can estimate both reasonably well. The neural computation underlying this ability remains poorly understood. Here we propose that the human visual system uses different aspects of object images to separately estimate the contributions of the material and shape. Specifically, material perception relies mainly on the intensity gradient magnitude information, while shape perception relies mainly on the intensity gradient order information. A clue to this hypothesis was provided by the observation that luminance-histogram manipulation, which changes luminance gradient magnitudes but not the luminance-order map, effectively alters the material appearance but not the shape of an object. In agreement with this observation, we found that the simulated physical material changes do not significantly affect the intensity order information. A series of psychophysical experiments further indicate that human surface shape perception is robust against intensity manipulations provided they do not disturb the intensity order information. In addition, we show that the two types of gradient information can be utilized for the discrimination of albedo changes from highlights. These findings suggest that the visual system relies on these diagnostic image features to estimate physical properties in a distal world.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hiqJxpkZuOw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524862800000</updated><fingerprint>1a4b563b</fingerprint><engagement>41</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006061</link><title>Material and shape perception based on two types of intensity gradient information</title><author><name>Masataka Sawayama</name></author><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006061</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1524862800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masataka Sawayama, Shin&apos;ya Nishida&lt;/p&gt;

Our RNA sequencing analysis of NAFLD-HCC samples revealed squalene epoxidase (&lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt;) as the top outlier metabolic gene overexpressed in NAFLD-HCC patients. Hepatocyte-specific &lt;i&gt;Sqle&lt;/i&gt; transgenic expression in mice accelerated the development of high-fat, high-cholesterol diet–induced HCC. &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt; exerts its oncogenic effect via its metabolites, cholesteryl ester and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Increased &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt; expression promotes the biosynthesis of cholesteryl ester, which induces NAFLD-HCC cell growth. &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt; increased the NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/NADPH (reduced form of NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ratio, which triggered a cascade of events involving oxidative stress–induced DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) expression, DNMT3A-mediated epigenetic silencing of PTEN, and activation of AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). In human NAFLD-HCC and HCC, &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt; is overexpressed and its expression is associated with poor patient outcomes. Terbinafine, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved antifungal drug targeting &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt;, markedly inhibited &lt;i&gt;SQLE&lt;/i&gt;-induced NAFLD-HCC cell growth in NAFLD-HCC and HCC cells and attenuated tumor development in xenograft models and in &lt;i&gt;Sqle&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice. Suppression of tumor growth by terbinafine is associated with decreased cholesteryl ester concentrations, restoration of PTEN expression, and inhibition of AKT-mTOR, consistent with blockade of SQLE function.

Though gene expression data has been widely used to infer the cellular regulatory networks, the methods mainly infer correlations rather than causality. We propose that a causal inference framework successfully used for eQTL data can be extended to infer causal regulatory networks using enhancers as causal anchors and enhancer RNA expression as a readout of enhancer activity. Results: We developed statistical models and likelihood-ratio tests to infer causal gene regulatory networks using enhancer RNA (eRNA) expression information as a causal anchor and applied the framework to eRNA and transcript expression data from the FANTOM consortium.

We further improved the model by taking into account that some TFs might act in a quantitative, dosage-dependent manner, whereas others might act predominantly in a binary on/off fashion. We predicted TF targets from concerted variation of eRNA and TF and target promoter expression levels within a single cell type as well as across multiple cell types. Importantly, TFs with high-confidence predictions were largely different between these two analyses, demonstrating that variability within a cell type is highly relevant for target prediction of cell type specific factors.

The human brain has the impressive capacity to adapt how it processes information to high-level goals. While it is known that these cognitive control skills are malleable and can be improved through training, the underlying plasticity mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we develop and evaluate a model of how people learn when to exert cognitive control, which controlled process to use, and how much effort to exert. We derive this model from a general theory according to which the function of cognitive control is to select and configure neural pathways so as to make optimal use of finite time and limited computational resources. The central idea of our Learned Value of Control model is that people use reinforcement learning to predict the value of candidate control signals of different types and intensities based on stimulus features. This model correctly predicts the learning and transfer effects underlying the adaptive control-demanding behavior observed in an experiment on visual attention and four experiments on interference control in Stroop and Flanker paradigms.

The human brain has the impressive capacity to adapt how it processes information to high-level goals. While it is known that these cognitive control skills are malleable and can be improved through training, the underlying plasticity mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we develop and evaluate a model of how people learn when to exert cognitive control, which controlled process to use, and how much effort to exert. We derive this model from a general theory according to which the function of cognitive control is to select and configure neural pathways so as to make optimal use of finite time and limited computational resources. The central idea of our Learned Value of Control model is that people use reinforcement learning to predict the value of candidate control signals of different types and intensities based on stimulus features. This model correctly predicts the learning and transfer effects underlying the adaptive control-demanding behavior observed in an experiment on visual attention and four experiments on interference control in Stroop and Flanker paradigms. Moreover, our model explained these findings significantly better than an associative learning model and a Win-Stay Lose-Shift model. Our findings elucidate how learning and experience might shape people’s ability and propensity to adaptively control their minds and behavior. We conclude by predicting under which circumstances these learning mechanisms might lead to self-control failure.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Aj4DbuvGLfQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Aj4DbuvGLfQ/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>A fluidics-based impact sensor</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c4:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><unread>False</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daigo Takahashi, Keisuke Hara, Taiji Okano, Hiroaki Suzuki&lt;/p&gt;
Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based high-performance accelerometers are ubiquitously used in various electronic devices. However, there is an existing need to detect physical impacts using low-cost devices with no electronic circuits or a battery. We designed and fabricated an impact sensor prototype using a commercial stereolithography apparatus that only consists of a plastic housing and working fluids. The sensor device responds to the instantaneous acceleration (impact) by deformation and pinch off of a water droplet that is suspended in oil in a sensor cavity. We tested the various geometrical and physical parameters of the impact sensor to identify their relations to threshold acceleration values. We show that the state diagram that is plotted against the dimensionless Archimedes and Bond numbers adequately describes the response of the proposed sensor.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523394000000</updated><fingerprint>5457793e</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195741</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195741</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195741</originId><author><name>Daigo Takahashi</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1523394000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daigo Takahashi, Keisuke Hara, Taiji Okano, Hiroaki Suzuki&lt;/p&gt;

Brain structure and learning capacities both vary with experience, but the mechanistic link between them is unclear. Here, we investigated whether experience-dependent variability in learning performance can be explained by neuroplasticity in foraging honey bees. The mushroom bodies (MBs) are a brain center necessary for ambiguous olfactory learning tasks such as reversal learning. Using radio frequency identification technology, we assessed the effects of natural variation in foraging activity, and the age when first foraging, on both performance in reversal learning and on synaptic connectivity in the MBs. We found that reversal learning performance improved at foraging onset and could decline with greater foraging experience. If bees started foraging before the normal age, as a result of a stress applied to the colony, the decline in learning performance with foraging experience was more severe. Analyses of brain structure in the same bees showed that the total number of synaptic boutons at the MB input decreased when bees started foraging, and then increased with greater foraging intensity. At foraging onset MB structure is therefore optimized for bees to update learned information, but optimization of MB connectivity deteriorates with foraging effort. In a computational model of the MBs sparser coding of information at the MB input improved reversal learning performance. We propose, therefore, a plausible mechanistic relationship between experience, neuroplasticity, and cognitive performance in a natural and ecological context.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><fingerprint>356b887b</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196749</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196749</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196749</originId><author><name>Amélie Cabirol</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525122000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amélie Cabirol, Alex J.

However, manual analysis and grading performed by pathologists are typically subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automatic technique for Gleason grading of prostate cancer from H&amp;amp;E stained whole slide biopsy images using a set of novel completed and statistical local binary pattern (CSLBP) descriptors. First the technique divides the whole slide image into a set of small image tiles, where salient tumor tiles with high nuclei densities are selected for analysis.

However, manual analysis and grading performed by pathologists are typically subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automatic technique for Gleason grading of prostate cancer from H&amp;amp;E stained whole slide biopsy images using a set of novel completed and statistical local binary pattern (CSLBP) descriptors. First the technique divides the whole slide image into a set of small image tiles, where salient tumor tiles with high nuclei densities are selected for analysis. The CSLBP texture features that encode pixel intensity variations from circularly surrounding neighborhoods are then extracted from salient image tiles to characterize different Gleason patterns. Finally, CSLBP texture features computed from all tiles are integrated and utilized by the multi-class support vector machine (SVM) that assigns patient biopsy with different Gleason score of 6, 7 or [≥]8. Experiments have been performed on 312 different patient cases selected from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and have achieved more than 79% classification accuracies, which is superior to state-of-the-art textural descriptors for prostate cancer Gleason grading.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315648v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/439?rss=1</originId><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1630325226e:3dd917:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1524766155374</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Rapid detection of nucleic acids is integral for clinical diagnostics and biotechnological applications.

In pathology, Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of tissue sections is regularly used to diagnose and grade malignant tumors. Typically, IHC stain interpretation is rendered by a trained pathologist using a manual method, which consists of counting each positively- and negatively-stained cell under a microscope. The manual enumeration suffers from poor reproducibility even in the hands of expert pathologists. To facilitate this process, we propose a novel method to create artificial datasets with the known ground truth which allows us to analyze the recall, precision, accuracy, and intra- and inter-observer variability in a systematic manner, enabling us to compare different computer analysis approaches. Our method employs a conditional Generative Adversarial Network that uses a database of Ki67 stained tissues of breast cancer patients to generate synthetic digital slides. Our experiments show that synthetic images are indistinguishable from real images. Six readers (three pathologists and three image analysts) tried to differentiate 15 real from 15 synthetic images and the probability that the average reader would be able to correctly classify an image as synthetic or real more than 50% of the time was only 44.7%.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>cd2857f3</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196846</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196846</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196846</originId><author><name>Caglar Senaras</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Caglar Senaras, Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi, Berkman Sahiner, Michael P.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Amino-acids positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly used in the diagnostic workup of patients with gliomas, including differential diagnosis, evaluation of tumor extension, treatment planning and follow-up.

Ground truth segmentations were obtained using manual delineation and thresholding (1.3 x background).

After 150 epochs, DSC reached 0.7924 in the training set and 0.7911 in the validation set. After morphological dilatation and fixed thresholding of the predicted U-Net mask a substantial improvement of the DSC to 0.8231 (+ 4.1%) was noted.

I can state as a fact that the first time I heard a joking reference to his attitude towards traditional synthetic organic chemistry was in the summer of 1983, so it’s not like he’s been keeping his thoughts bottled up. But this is certainly a good summary of them, and here’s the key question that’s being asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The ability to put together molecules – bit‐by‐bit, simple or complex – is one of chemistry’s great accomplishments, and a source of amazement to those in many other fields of science. More than one physicist has told me that s/he cannot believe that it is possible to manipulate bonds between individual atoms with the skill that organic chemists do. When I look at a complex structure assembled in a beautifully organized campaign, I also am amazed. That said, all fields of science morph with time. The phrase “organic synthesis” has come to mean “synthesis of structurally complex natural products”, or, perhaps, “synthesis of complicated molecules with pharmaceutical activity.” Nature, and relevance to healthcare, define the targets, and provide the utilitarian justification for the effort. Is there (or should there be) more to it than that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsidiary questions are whether organic synthesis of that sort is worth the effort that’s being put into it and whether it trains students to do useful things and whether other types of work could do a better job of that. In order to address these, Whitesides notes, we have to make sure that we’re talking about the same things. He defines “organic synthesis” (small letters) as any sort of putting-together-of-organic molecules, and “Organic Synthesis” (with the capitals) as the sort of complex and often natural-product-based synthesis practiced by R. B. Woodward, his contemporaries, and his intellectual heirs. The latter is what many people mean by those two words, to be sure, and Whitesides has some questions about just what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the field a science that generates new concepts and new theory? Is it instead more of an art form, driven at least partly by aesthetic choices (that can be appreciated by skilled observers) rather than utility &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;? Or is it something of a craft, achieving its results (in the end) through skilled empirical tinkering? These questions, especially in the way that they’re phrased, are likely to cause intense annoyance in some practitioners. But I think that the annoyance is a sign that these categories are uncomfortably plausible and recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the field partakes of all of these characteristics, but on what proportions? I think that the science/craft distinction is actually one question, and that these are on the same scale with opposite signs: the more solid the theoretical framework, the less Edisonian tinkering. My opinion is toward the Edisonian end. Organic synthesis is not bereft of theories and organizing concepts, but they do not operate strongly enough (that is, in a detailed enough fashion) to allow us to predict (for example) reaction conditions. That’s why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. The same goes for predicting new reactions, which is why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/11/24/reaction_discovery_reviewed&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. No one sat down a few decades ago and said “Y’know, my knowledge of organometallic chemistry allows me to predict that palladium, in particular, will show oxidative addition/reductive elimination behavior that will be spectacularly useful in carbon-carbon bond formation. And while I’m making bold predictions, you might try aryl boronic acids for that reaction first, even though hardly any such things have even been described”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for art, I would very much like to have a dollar for every total-synthesis person who has talked about the field in terms of its artistic qualities. We have Woodward to thank for this – the man was a &lt;em&gt;tremendous&lt;/em&gt; scientist, but his influence has &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/07/22/woodwards-prose-style&quot;&gt;not always been&lt;/a&gt; for the good. I don’t think nearly as many people went into spasms about elegance and beauty in reference to total synthesis before him, and what’s more annoying is that those are valid concepts to apply even if Woodward sometimes came across like an Aubrey Beardsley aesthete about them. My own view is that we should let the artistic qualities of organic synthesis, which exist, speak for themselves. Because if they can’t, no amount of &lt;em&gt;raffiniert&lt;/em&gt; gushing about them will substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitesides isn’t through. That three-parter is just his first of three questions! The second one is a two-parter: is organic synthesis best thought of as an enabling technology to do things (such as make drugs, etc.) or as a framework that lets us ask questions about the nature of molecules and their behavior? That is, are the uses to which we put this field, and the justifications we give for it, best described as practical ones or intellectual ones? We tend to haul out the former first and start talking in better-living-through-(organic)-chemistry style, and that’s understandable. Compounds made through organic synthesis, and available through no other practical means, are crucial underpinnings of the modern world. If we’re not proud of that, what are we to be proud of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that second justification, while it sounds like more aesthetic hand-waving to the lay public (and to funding agencies), has some staying power. Ask the physicists, or even the mathematicians. Asking fundamental questions, and having the right framework in which to be able to ask them, can pay off hugely even from the practical end, intellectual satisfaction aside. There’s a lot of number theory that was just another ornament of mathematics until it became vital for modern cryptography and secure communications (G. H. Hardy would have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2IK9D0o&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;horrified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Relativity was a fantastic intellectual feat by Einstein, but relativistic corrections are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html&quot;&gt;needed&lt;/a&gt; to make the GPS system work correctly, among many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third question is, what should we teach chemistry students about the field? That is, what are the most important things for them to know? There’s a massive pile of empirical knowledge, famously dreaded by sophomores, but it’s taught (or should be!) according to general organizing principles – although those are the very ones that are not quite adequate enough to explain everything that’s going on. At what level should we teach this subject? You can say “Here are reactions that depend on alpha-carbonyl anions, and here’s why they happen”, you can say “Time to learn the difference between the Dieckmann and Claisen condensations”, or “Here are the kinds of products these reactions form and what they’re used for”, or “Here are some tips on how to run these things at the bench”, and on and on. What should be in the syllabus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own take on this is that there should definitely be a bias towards the general principles, which is what the better organic chemistry professors already do. Teaching the subject as a pile of reactions is a crime. I may be too loose about this stuff, but I would rather a student, if it came down to it, mess up a bit on the detailed mechanism of the Mitsunobu reaction if they understand that its driving force is the thermodynamic sink of triphenylphosphine oxide formation. The difference between the Dieckmann and the Claisen condensations is that the former is intramolecular and the latter is intermolecular, but I think it’s a waste of brain space to give them different names and memorize them as such. I would much rather that a student, in this case, immediately recognize the mechanism of an alpha-carbonyl anion attacking an ester carbonyl (no matter what the name associated with that process is) and recognize the influence of the leaving group of the ester, the stability vs. reactivity characteristics of the nucleophile, the likelihood of the various ring sizes being formed in the intramolecular reaction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nowhere near exhausted the Annoying Questions of George Whitesides, but this post is long enough as it is!

MRL/MpJ mice have abundant ovarian mast cells (MCs) as compared with other strains at postnatal day 0 (P0); however, they sharply decrease after birth. These ovarian MCs, particularly beneath the ovarian surface epithelium (SE), which express mucosal MC (MMC) marker, might participate in early follicular development. This study investigated the changes in spatiotemporal distribution of MCs in the perinatal MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. At P0 to P7, the MCs were densely localized to the ovary, especially their caudomedial region around the ovary-fimbria connection. The neonatal ovarian MCs showed intermediate characteristics of MMC and connective tissue MC (CTMC), and the latter phenotype became evident with aging. However, the expression ratio of the MMC to CTMC marker increased from P0 to P4 in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovary. Similarly, the ratio of MCs facing SE to total MC number increased with aging, although the number of ovarian MCs decreased, indicating the relative increase in MMC phenotypes in the early neonatal ovary. Neither proliferating nor apoptotic MCs were found in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. The parenchymal cells surrounding MCs at ovary-fimbria connection showed similar molecular expression patterns (E-cadherin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Foxl2&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/Gata4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as that of the ovarian surface epithelial cells. At P2, around the ovary-fimbria connection, c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; immature oocytes formed clusters called nests, and some MCs localized adjacent to c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; oocytes within the nests. These results indicated that in postnatal MRL/MpJ mice, ovarian MCs changed their distribution by migrating toward the parenchymal cells composing ovary-fimbria connection, which possessed similar characteristics to the ovarian surface epithelium. Thus, we elucidated the spatiotemporal alterations of the ovarian MCs in MRL/MpJ mice, and suggested their importance during the early follicular development by migrating toward the ovary-fimbria connection. MRL/MpJ mice would be useful to elucidate the relationship between neonatal immunity and reproductive systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><fingerprint>315ebd8b</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196364</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196364</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196364</originId><author><name>Teppei Nakamura</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524517200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Teppei Nakamura, Masataka Chihara, Osamu Ichii, Saori Otsuka-Kanazawa, Ken-ichi Nagasaki, Yaser Hosny Ali Elewa, Osamu Tatsumi, Yasuhiro Kon&lt;/p&gt;

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can promote evolutionary adaptation by transforming a species’ relationship to the environment. In most well-understood cases of HGT, acquired and donor functions appear to remain closely related. Thus, the degree to which HGT can lead to evolutionary novelties remains unclear. Mucorales fungi sense gravity through the sedimentation of vacuolar protein crystals. Here, we identify the octahedral crystal matrix protein (OCTIN). Phylogenetic analysis strongly supports acquisition of &lt;i&gt;octin&lt;/i&gt; by HGT from bacteria. A bacterial OCTIN forms high-order periplasmic oligomers, and inter-molecular disulphide bonds are formed by both fungal and bacterial OCTINs, suggesting that they share elements of a conserved assembly mechanism. However, estimated sedimentation velocities preclude a gravity-sensing function for the bacterial structures. Together, our data suggest that HGT from bacteria into the Mucorales allowed a dramatic increase in assembly scale and emergence of the gravity-sensing function. We conclude that HGT can lead to evolutionary novelties that emerge depending on the physiological and cellular context of protein assembly.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3S3tn6RO_8s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524603600000</updated><fingerprint>305bb730</fingerprint><engagement>70</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004920</link><title>Evolutionary novelty in gravity sensing through horizontal gene transfer and high-order protein assembly</title><author><name>Tu Anh Nguyen</name></author><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004920</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1524603600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tu Anh Nguyen, Jamie Greig, Asif Khan, Cara Goh, Gregory Jedd&lt;/p&gt;

Echinoderms are capable of asexual reproduction by fission. An individual divides into parts due to changes in the strength of connective tissue of the body wall. The structure of connective tissue and the mechanisms of variations in its strength in echinoderms remain poorly studied. An analysis of transcriptomes of individuals during the process of fission provides a new opportunity to understand the mechanisms of connective tissue mutability. In the holothurian &lt;i&gt;Cladolabes schmeltzii&lt;/i&gt;, we have found a rather complex organization of connective tissue. Transcripts of genes encoding a wide range of structural proteins of extracellular matrix, as well as various proteases and their inhibitors, have been discovered. All these molecules may constitute a part of the mechanism of connective tissue mutability. According to our data, the extracellular matrix of echinoderms is substantially distinguished from that of vertebrates by the lack of elastin, fibronectins, and tenascins. In case of fission, a large number of genes of transcription factors and components of different signaling pathways are expressed. Products of these genes are probably involved in regulation of asexual reproduction, connective tissue mutability, and preparation of tissues for subsequent regeneration. It has been shown that holothurian tensilins are a special group of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which has formed within the class Holothuroidea and is absent from other echinoderms. Our data can serve a basis for the further study of the mechanisms of extracellular matrix mutability, as well as the mechanisms responsible for asexual reproduction in echinoderms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><fingerprint>9dc269e0</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195836</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195836</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195836</originId><author><name>Igor Yu.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;In two concurrent studies, we aimed to a) confirm the acute effect of 0.3 g·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight (BW) sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) supplementation on central and peripheral mechanisms associated with explosive power (Study 1) and b) determine whether chronic NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation would improve the adaptive response of the neuromuscular system during a 10-week resistance training program (Study 2).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight resistance trained participants volunteered after providing written consent. The experimental design consisted of a week of baseline testing, followed by ten weeks of training with progress measures performed in Week 5. Study 1 involved neuromuscular measurements before and after the leg extension portion of a power based training session performed in Week 1. Changes in maximal torque (MVT) and rates of torque development (RTD), along with other variables derived from femoral nerve stimulation (e.g. voluntary activation, neural recruitment) were analysed to determine the extent of fatigue under NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or placebo conditions. Changes in these same variables, coupled with functional 1-repetition maximum leg extension strength, were measured in Study 2 from baseline (Week 0) to Week 5, and again at Week 10.&lt;/p&gt; Results and conclusion &lt;p&gt;In Study 1, we observed a decline after the leg extension task in both MVT (~ 30%) and rates of torque production (RTD) irrespective of acid-base status, however the decline in maximal RTD (RTD&lt;sub&gt;MAX&lt;/sub&gt;) was nearly 20% less in the NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; condition when compared to placebo (mean difference of 294.8 ± 133.4 Nm·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (95% CI -583.1 to -6.5 Nm, p &amp;lt; 0.05)).

The increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus is becoming a serious threat to human health in various parts of the world. Studies with dairy products have shown a potential beneficial effect against diabetes. This experiment evaluated the supplementation of milk naturally enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and polyphenols in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Forty male 28-day-old &lt;i&gt;Wistar&lt;/i&gt; rats were distributed in four experimental treatments of diabetic animals (streptozotocin induction) and a normal group (non-induced). Experimental treatments were: control (water), whole common milk (COM-M), milk enriched with PUFA (PUFA-M), milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols (PUFA/P-M) through a special diet offered to dairy cows. Milk supplementation at a dose 5 mL/kg body weight was performed for 77 days, 42 days before and 35 days after diabetes induction. The COM-M supplementation increased brown fat deposits, reduced post-induction glucose levels, reduced blood fructosamine levels, and improved glucose tolerance. Milk enriched with PUFA reduced final fasting glucose, LDL levels, and improved blood antioxidant capacity. Milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols promoted an increase in gastrocnemius muscle mass, and a reduction in mesenteric fat and LDL levels. Milk intake, with an emphasis on milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols, attenuated the metabolic disorders of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523653200000</updated><fingerprint>9dcd7556</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195839</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195839</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195839</originId><author><name>Emerson H.

Many catabolic stimuli, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) in combination with oncostatin M (OSM), promote cartilage breakdown via the induction of collagen-degrading collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (&lt;i&gt;MMP1&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; in human articular chondrocytes. Indeed, joint diseases with an inflammatory component are characterised by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) catabolism. Importantly, protein kinase C (PKC) signalling has a primary role in cytokine-induced &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt; expression, and is known to regulate cellular functions associated with pathologies involving ECM remodelling. At present, substrates downstream of PKC remain undefined. Herein, we show that both IL-1- and OSM-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase D (PKD) in human chondrocytes is strongly associated with signalling via the atypical PKCι isoform. Consequently, inhibiting PKD activation with a pan-PKD inhibitor significantly reduced the expression of &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Specific gene silencing of the PKD isoforms revealed that only PKD3 (&lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt;) depletion mirrored the observed &lt;i&gt;MMP&lt;/i&gt; repression, indicative of the pharmacological inhibitor specifically affecting only this isoform. &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing was also shown to reduce serine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as phosphorylation of all three mitogen-activated protein kinase groups. This altered signalling following &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing led to a significant reduction in the expression of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) genes &lt;i&gt;FOS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JUN&lt;/i&gt;, critical for the induction of many MMPs including &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the AP-1 factor activating transcription factor 3 (&lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt;) was also reduced concomitant with the observed reduction in &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; expression.

Tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, requires two phosphorylation steps to form a competitive inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. Adenylate kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;) has been previously demonstrated to phosphorylate tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate, while creatine kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;), pyruvate kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;) and pyruvate kinase, liver and red blood cell (&lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt;) each have been found to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to the pharmacologically active tenofovir-diphosphate. In the present study, genomic DNA isolated from dried blood spots collected from 505 participants from Bangkok, Thailand; Cape Town, South Africa; and New York City, USA were examined for variants in &lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt; using next-generation sequencing. The bioinformatics tools SIFT and PolyPhen predicted that 19 of the 505 individuals (3.7% frequency) carried variants in at least one kinase that would result in a decrease or loss of enzymatic activity. To functionally test these predictions, AK2 and AK2 variants were expressed in and purified from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, followed by investigation of their activities towards tenofovir. Interestingly, we found that purified AK2 had the ability to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to tenofovir-diphosphate in addition to phosphorylating tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate.

Tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, requires two phosphorylation steps to form a competitive inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. Adenylate kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;) has been previously demonstrated to phosphorylate tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate, while creatine kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;), pyruvate kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;) and pyruvate kinase, liver and red blood cell (&lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt;) each have been found to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to the pharmacologically active tenofovir-diphosphate. In the present study, genomic DNA isolated from dried blood spots collected from 505 participants from Bangkok, Thailand; Cape Town, South Africa; and New York City, USA were examined for variants in &lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt; using next-generation sequencing. The bioinformatics tools SIFT and PolyPhen predicted that 19 of the 505 individuals (3.7% frequency) carried variants in at least one kinase that would result in a decrease or loss of enzymatic activity. To functionally test these predictions, AK2 and AK2 variants were expressed in and purified from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, followed by investigation of their activities towards tenofovir. Interestingly, we found that purified AK2 had the ability to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to tenofovir-diphosphate in addition to phosphorylating tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate. Further, four of the six AK2 variants predicted to result in a loss or decrease of enzyme function exhibited a ≥30% decrease in activity towards tenofovir in our in vitro assays. Of note, an AK2 K28R variant resulted in a 72% and 81% decrease in the formation of tenofovir-monophosphate and tenofovir-diphosphate, respectively. These data suggest that there are naturally occurring genetic variants that could potentially impact TFV activation.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Stress granule transcription</title><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7ce:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>96ddfc2</fingerprint><published>1525974002000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</originId><author><name>Mao, S.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/616.2.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/highwire/pnas/115/16.cover-source.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>813</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>1088</height></visual><title>Plasticity in early immune evasion strategies of a bacterial pathogen [Microbiology]</title><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162d525c55d:348c31d:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523994445149</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>Borrelia burgdorferi is one of the few extracellular pathogens capable of establishing persistent infection in mammals.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to generate an ultrasonic nanobubble (NB)-mediated purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)/fludarabine suicide gene system for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;NBs were prepared from a mixture the phospholipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DPPA), perfluoropropane gas and other materials using the high shear dispersion method. NBs treated with ultrasound irradiation functioned as a gene-transfer system, and a self-constructed suicide gene expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP, treated with fludarabine functioned as a therapeutic gene. This system was used to determine the cytotoxic effects of PNP/fludarabine on HepG2 cells and SMMC7721 cells.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1. NBs with a small diameter (208–416 nm) and at a high concentration and fine homogeneity were prepared under the optimal method. 2. The pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP plasmid was efficiently transfected into HCC cells using ultrasonic NBs. 3. At 0.75μg/ml fludarabine, PNP/fludarabine showed marked cytotoxic effects toward HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. PNP/fludarabine achieved the same effect against both SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells but at a lower concentration of fludarabine for the latter. 4. Bystander effects: a 10–20% decrease in the cell survival rate was observed when only 5–10% of transfected cells were PNP positive.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;NBs constitute a non-toxic, stable and effective gene-delivery platform. The PNP/fludarabine suicide gene system inhibited the growth of HCC cells, induced HCC cell apoptosis, and caused a notable bystander effect at a low fludarabine concentration. This study establishes an important new method for miniaturizing microbubbles and improving a new NB-mediated approach for gene therapy of HCC.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><fingerprint>849a7e78</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</originId><author><name>Bo Zhang</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525294800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Zhang, Mingna Chen, Youming Zhang, Wei Chen, Lihua Zhang, Lv Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Mounting evidence suggests that glycans, rather than merely serving as a “shield”, contribute critically to antigenicity of the HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein, representing critical antigenic determinants for many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). While many studies have focused on defining the role of individual glycans or groups of proximal glycans in bNAb binding, little is known about the effects of changes in the overall glycan landscape in modulating antibody access and Env antigenicity.

Mounting evidence suggests that glycans, rather than merely serving as a “shield”, contribute critically to antigenicity of the HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein, representing critical antigenic determinants for many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). While many studies have focused on defining the role of individual glycans or groups of proximal glycans in bNAb binding, little is known about the effects of changes in the overall glycan landscape in modulating antibody access and Env antigenicity. Here we developed a systems glycobiology approach to reverse engineer the complexity of HIV glycan heterogeneity to guide antigenicity-based &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; glycoprotein design. bNAb binding was assessed against a panel of 94 recombinant gp120 monomers exhibiting defined glycan site occupancies. Using a Bayesian machine learning algorithm, bNAb-specific glycan footprints were identified and used to design antigens that selectively alter bNAb antigenicity as a proof-of concept. Our approach provides a new design strategy to predictively modulate antigenicity via the alteration of glycan topography, thereby focusing the humoral immune response on sites of viral vulnerability for HIV.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XbpST9Ne8uU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/XbpST9Ne8uU/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>High frequency neural spiking and auditory signaling by ultrafast red-shifted optogenetics</title><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1631b03fc98:2393e66:4e164c41</id><crawled>1525166636184</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;High frequency neural spiking and auditory signaling by ultrafast red-shifted optogenetics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High frequency neural spiking and auditory signaling by ultrafast red-shifted optogenetics, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04146-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04146-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Optogenetic applications would benefit from channelrhodopsins (ChRs) with faster photostimulation, increased tissue transparency and lower phototoxicity.

Background &lt;p&gt;Five billion people lack access to safe, affordable, and timely surgical and anesthesia care. Significant challenges remain in the provision of surgical care in low-resource settings. Uganda is no exception.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From September to November 2016, we conducted a mixed-methods countrywide surgical capacity assessment at 17 randomly selected public hospitals in Uganda. Researchers conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders to understand factors related to the provision of surgical care. The framework approach was used for thematic and explanatory data analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The Ugandan public health care sector continues to face significant challenges in the provision of safe, timely, and affordable surgical care. These challenges can be broadly grouped into preparedness and policy, service delivery, and the financial burden of surgical care. Hospital staff reported challenges including: (1) significant delays in accessing surgical care, compounded by a malfunctioning referral system; (2) critical workforce shortages; (3) operative capacity that is limited by inadequate infrastructure and overwhelmed by emergency and obstetric volume; (4) supply chain difficulties pertaining to provision of essential medications, equipment, supplies, and blood; (5) significant, variable, and sometimes catastrophic expenditures for surgical patients and their families; and (6) a lack of surgery-specific policies and priorities. Despite these challenges, innovative strategies are being used in the public to provide surgical care to those most in need.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Barriers to the provision of surgical care are cross-cutting and involve constraints in infrastructure, service delivery, workforce, and financing. Understanding current strengths and shortfalls of Uganda’s surgical system is a critical first step in developing effective, targeted policy and programming that will build and strengthen its surgical capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523998800000</updated><fingerprint>65833887</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195986</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195986</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195986</originId><author><name>Katherine Albutt</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1523998800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine Albutt, Rachel R.

Understanding how knowledge is represented in the human brain is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. To date, most of the work on this topic has focused on knowledge representation in cortical areas and debated whether knowledge is represented in a distributed or localized fashion. Fang and colleagues provide evidence that brain connections and the white matter supporting such connections might play a significant role.

Here we show that an acidic patch formed by histones H2A and H2B of the nucleosome relieves the autoinhibition imposed by the AutoN and the NegC regions of the human ISWI remodeler SNF2h. Further, by single molecule FRET we show that the acidic patch helps control the distance travelled per translocation event.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Product packaging has long been used by the tobacco industry to target consumers and manipulate product perceptions. This study examines the extent to which cigarillo packaging influences perceptions of product flavor, taste, smell, and appeal.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A web-based experiment was conducted among young adults. Participants viewed three randomly selected cigarillo packs, varying on pack flavor descriptor, color, type, branding, and warning—totaling 180 pack images. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effect of pack elements on product perceptions.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 2,664 current, ever, and never little cigar and cigarillo users participated. Cigarillo packs with a flavor descriptor were perceived as having a more favorable taste (β = 0.21, p &amp;lt; .001) and smell (β = 0.14, p &amp;lt; .001) compared to packs with no flavor descriptor. Compared to packs with no color, pink and purple packs were more likely to be perceived as containing a flavor (β = 0.11, p &amp;lt; .001), and were rated more favorably on taste (β = 0.17, p &amp;lt; .001), smell (β = 0.15, p &amp;lt; .001), and appeal (β = 0.16, p &amp;lt; .001). While warnings on packs decreased favorable perceptions of product taste (pictorial: β = -0.07, p = .03) and smell (text-only: β = -0.08, p = .01; pictorial: β = -0.09, p = .007), warnings did not moderate the effects of flavor descriptor or color.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantitative evidence that cigarillo packaging alters consumers’ cognitive responses, and warnings on packs do not suffice to overcome the effects of product packaging. The findings support efforts at federal, state, and local levels to prohibit flavor descriptors and their associated product flavoring in non-cigarette products such as cigarillos, along with new data that supports restrictions on flavor cues and colors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524171600000</updated><fingerprint>fab54a29</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</originId><author><name>Clare Meernik</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524171600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Clare Meernik, Leah M.

The findings support efforts at federal, state, and local levels to prohibit flavor descriptors and their associated product flavoring in non-cigarette products such as cigarillos, along with new data that supports restrictions on flavor cues and colors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Initial excited‐state relaxation of locked retinal protonated schiff base chromophore.

Rho-GTPases are master regulators of polarity establishment and cell morphology. Positive feedback enables concentration of Rho-GTPases into clusters at the cell cortex, from where they regulate the cytoskeleton. Different cell types reproducibly generate either one (e.g. the front of a migrating cell) or several clusters (e.g. the multiple dendrites of a neuron), but the mechanistic basis for unipolar or multipolar outcomes is unclear. The design principles of Rho-GTPase circuits are captured by two-component reaction-diffusion models based on conserved aspects of Rho-GTPase biochemistry. Some such models display rapid winner-takes-all competition between clusters, yielding a unipolar outcome. Other models allow prolonged co-existence of clusters. We investigate the behavior of a simple class of models and show that while the timescale of competition varies enormously depending on model parameters, a single factor explains a large majority of this variation. The dominant factor concerns the degree to which the maximal active GTPase concentration in a cluster approaches a “saturation point” determined by model parameters. We suggest that both saturation and the effect of saturation on competition reflect fundamental properties of the Rho-GTPase polarity machinery, regardless of the specific feedback mechanism, which predict whether the system will generate unipolar or multipolar outcomes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HtPVWxk38yc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><fingerprint>32706f56</fingerprint><engagement>9</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006095</link><title>Principles that govern competition or co-existence in Rho-GTPase driven polarization</title><author><name>Jian-Geng Chiou</name></author><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006095</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1523566800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian-Geng Chiou, Samuel A.

&lt;i&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&lt;/i&gt; is a medicinal mushroom that has been widely used in East Asia for the treatment of various diseases. The pharmacological activity of this fungus is primarily attributable to the polysaccharides and triterpenoids. In this study, to obtain the fruit bodies with improved content of active constituents, we examined the effect of salicylic acid (SA) and calcium ion on the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and triterpenoids by spraying the chemicals during the fruiting. To explore the underlying mechanisms for the variation, the transcripts of related genes involved in the polysaccharide and triterpenoid biosynthesis were measured. Results showed that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; had no effect on production of polysaccharides and triterpenoids, whereas SA increased triterpenoid content by 23.32%, compared to the control, but it had little influence on polysaccharide production. Interestingly, the combined induction increased polysaccharide and triterpenoid content by 9.02% and 13.61%, respectively, compared to the control. Under Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induction, the transcript of &lt;i&gt;ugp&lt;/i&gt; gene in the polysaccharide biosynthetic pathway up-regulated in all three stages (mycelium, primordium, and fruit body), while &lt;i&gt;pgm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;gls&lt;/i&gt; gave no response in the mycelium and primordium stages, and up-regulated in the fruit body stage. Differently, six key triterpenoid biosynthetic genes including &lt;i&gt;hmgr&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;hmgs&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mvd&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;fps&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sqs&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ls&lt;/i&gt; did not respond to the induction.

The structural diversity of terpenoids is limited by the isoprene rule which states that all primary terpene synthase products derive from methyl-branched building blocks with five carbon atoms. With this study we discover a broad spectrum of novel terpenoids with eleven carbon atoms as byproducts of bacterial 2-methylisoborneol or 2-methylenebornane synthases. Both enzymes use 2-methyl-GPP as substrate, which is synthesized from GPP by the action of a methyltransferase. We used &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains that heterologously produce different C11-terpene synthases together with the GPP methyltransferase and the mevalonate pathway enzymes. With this &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; approach, 35 different C11-terpenes could be produced. In addition to eleven known compounds, it was possible to detect 24 novel C11-terpenes which have not yet been described as terpene synthase products. Four of them, 3,4-dimethylcumene, 2-methylborneol and the two diastereomers of 2-methylcitronellol could be identified.

The neural mechanisms contributing to these beneficial effects are unknown. We examined corticospinal function by evaluating motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by cortical and subcortical stimulation of corticospinal axons and the activity in intracortical circuits in a finger muscle before and after 30 min of AIH or sham AIH. We found that the amplitude of cortically and subcortically elicited MEPs increased for 75 min after AIH but not sham AIH while intracortical activity remained unchanged. To examine further these subcortical effects, we assessed spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) targeting spinal synapses and the excitability of spinal motoneurons. Notably, AIH increased STDP outcomes while spinal motoneuron excitability remained unchanged.

The neural mechanisms contributing to these beneficial effects are unknown. We examined corticospinal function by evaluating motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by cortical and subcortical stimulation of corticospinal axons and the activity in intracortical circuits in a finger muscle before and after 30 min of AIH or sham AIH. We found that the amplitude of cortically and subcortically elicited MEPs increased for 75 min after AIH but not sham AIH while intracortical activity remained unchanged.

We previously introduced an approach for EVD prognosis prediction, using models that can be implemented in the field and updated in light of new data. Here we enhance and validate our methods with the largest published EVD dataset to date. We also present a proof-of-concept medical app that summarizes patient information and offers tailored treatment options using an interactive risk visualization for quick interpretation and decision-making. Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district. We corroborated earlier reports on the importance of viral load and age as mortality predictors and identified jaundice and bleeding to be features with highest predictive value at presentation. Additional clinical symptoms at presentation, although individually weakly correlated with outcome, help broaden sensitivity and refine discrimination of the models. The app provides a visual representation of the predictive outcome as well as attributing clinical protocols adjusted by demographic parameters and prioritized to target the largest contributing factor to overall risk. Conclusions: We derived and validated high performance models of EVD prognosis prediction from the largest and most geographically diverse EVD patients available to date. The performance was maintained during external validations on two independent datasets representing different treatment settings and mortality rates, which suggests that the models could be generalized to new populations. This tool may better inform treatment choices in future EVD outbreaks. It also provides a template to validate additional datasets used in developing novel clinical-decision support systems for EVD and other emerging infectious diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8b197a6a</fingerprint><published>1523948400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294587v2?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294587v2?rss=1</originId><author><name>Colubri, A.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/17/294587</canonicalUrl><description>Background: The 2014-2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak highlighted the need for rigorous, rapid, and field-deployable tools to enable case management.

We also present a proof-of-concept medical app that summarizes patient information and offers tailored treatment options using an interactive risk visualization for quick interpretation and decision-making. Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district. We corroborated earlier reports on the importance of viral load and age as mortality predictors and identified jaundice and bleeding to be features with highest predictive value at presentation. Additional clinical symptoms at presentation, although individually weakly correlated with outcome, help broaden sensitivity and refine discrimination of the models. The app provides a visual representation of the predictive outcome as well as attributing clinical protocols adjusted by demographic parameters and prioritized to target the largest contributing factor to overall risk. Conclusions: We derived and validated high performance models of EVD prognosis prediction from the largest and most geographically diverse EVD patients available to date. The performance was maintained during external validations on two independent datasets representing different treatment settings and mortality rates, which suggests that the models could be generalized to new populations. This tool may better inform treatment choices in future EVD outbreaks. It also provides a template to validate additional datasets used in developing novel clinical-decision support systems for EVD and other emerging infectious diseases.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294587v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Retraction: Novel Approach to Activity Evaluation for Release-Active Forms of Anti-Interferon-Gamma Antibodies Based on Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3afb:5785ab88</id><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Editors &lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><fingerprint>399bb4e2</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197086</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197086</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197086</originId><author><name>The PLOS ONE Editors</name></author><engagement>14</engagement><published>1525381200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Editors &lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197086</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/18/4619/F1.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>383</height></visual><title>Rapid selection of a pyrethroid metabolic enzyme CYP9K1 by operational malaria control activities [Applied Biological Sciences]</title><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1631d51f359:2877c84:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1525205300057</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>Since 2004, indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide-impregnated bednets (LLINs) have reduced the malaria parasite prevalence in children on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, from 45% to 12%.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>3e9b2388</fingerprint><engagement>111</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</link><title>Network inference reveals novel connections in pathways regulating growth and defense in the yeast salt response</title><engagementRate>11.1</engagementRate><author><name>Matthew E.

Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sNFhadDEsvQ/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05100-5/d41586-018-05100-5_15738972.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height></visual><title>How Much Can We Know?</title><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1634444e071:9c5459:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525858754673</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Much Can We Know?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Much Can We Know?, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05100-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05100-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The reach of the scientific method is constrained by the limitations of our tools and the intrinsic impenetrability of some of nature’s deepest questions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4b10c565</fingerprint><engagement>233</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05100-5</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05100-5</originId><engagementRate>2.18</engagementRate><author><name>Marcelo Gleiser</name></author><published>1525849200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Much Can We Know?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Much Can We Know?, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05100-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05100-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The reach of the scientific method is constrained by the limitations of our tools and the intrinsic impenetrability of some of nature’s deepest questions.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05100-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01666/20180503/images/medium/jm-2017-016668_0019.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>131</height></visual><title>[ASAP] Discovery of Tetrahydroquinoxalines as Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal Domain (BET) Inhibitors with Selectivity for the Second Bromodomain</title><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_1632c0d7a97:60f97b:a96d255</id><crawled>1525452470935</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>f0bde9e3</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01666/20180503/images/medium/jm-2017-016668_0019.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01666&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;To develop high-quality and safe healthcare, a good safety culture is an important feature of healthcare-providing structures. The objective of this study was to analyze the qualitative data of the comments section of a Hospital Survey on Patient Safety (HSOPS) questionnaire to clarify the answers given to the closed questions.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Using the original data from a cross-sectional survey of 5,064 employees at a single university hospital in France, we conducted a qualitative study by analyzing the comments of a HSOPS survey and conducting in-depth interviews with 19 healthcare providers. We submitted the comments and the interviews to a thematic analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 3,978 questionnaires were returned, with 247 comments collected. The qualitative analysis identified several structural failures. The main categories of the open comments were concordant with the lowest dimension scores found in the quantitative analysis. The most frequently reported failures were related to the staffing and hospital management support dimensions. The healthcare professionals perceived the lack of resources, including understaffing, as the major barrier to the development of a patient safety culture. Concrete organizational issues related to hospital handoffs and risk coordination were identified, such as transfers from the emergency departments and the lack of feedback following self-reporting of incidents.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The analysis of the open comments complemented the HSOPS scores, increasing the level of detail in the description of the hospital’s patient safety culture. Combined with a classical quantitative approach used in HSOPS-based surveys, the qualitative analysis of open comments is useful to identify organizational weaknesses within the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524171600000</updated><fingerprint>7a7ffa23</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196089</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196089</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196089</originId><author><name>Bastien Boussat</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524171600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bastien Boussat, Kevin Kamalanavin, Patrice François&lt;/p&gt;

Combined with a classical quantitative approach used in HSOPS-based surveys, the qualitative analysis of open comments is useful to identify organizational weaknesses within the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196089</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0009-7/MediaObjects/41591_2018_9_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>512</height></visual><title>Carboplatin in BRCA1/2-mutated and triple-negative breast cancer BRCAness subgroups: the TNT Trial</title><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_163172612f0:1e1115b:4e164c41</id><crawled>1525101761264</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carboplatin in &lt;i&gt;BRCA1/2&lt;/i&gt;-mutated and triple-negative breast cancer BRCAness subgroups: the TNT Trial&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carboplatin in &amp;lt;i&gt;BRCA1/2&amp;lt;/i&gt;-mutated and triple-negative breast cancer BRCAness subgroups: the TNT Trial, Published online: 30 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0009-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0009-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The phase 3 TNT Trial in subjects with triple-negative breast cancer supports the superiority of carboplatin over docetaxel in BRCA1/2-mutated tumors and a greater response to taxanes in the nonbasal subtype.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/zG-i0KeiTho&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>394905e3</fingerprint><engagement>107</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0009-7</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0009-7</originId><author><name>Andrew Tutt</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0009-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1525071600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carboplatin in &lt;i&gt;BRCA1/2&lt;/i&gt;-mutated and triple-negative breast cancer BRCAness subgroups: the TNT Trial&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carboplatin in &amp;lt;i&gt;BRCA1/2&amp;lt;/i&gt;-mutated and triple-negative breast cancer BRCAness subgroups: the TNT Trial, Published online: 30 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0009-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0009-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The phase 3 TNT Trial in subjects with triple-negative breast cancer supports the superiority of carboplatin over docetaxel in BRCA1/2-mutated tumors and a greater response to taxanes in the nonbasal subtype.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/zG-i0KeiTho&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/zG-i0KeiTho/s41591-018-0009-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02134/20180508/images/medium/jp-2018-02134n_0007.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>268</height></visual><title>[ASAP] Optical Properties of Vibronically Coupled Cy3 Dimers on DNA Scaffolds</title><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_1634170ad12:147cfe:d63e3ae2</id><crawled>1525811293458</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>3821d885</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02134/20180508/images/medium/jp-2018-02134n_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02134&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Bittersweet (&lt;i&gt;Solanum dulcamara&lt;/i&gt;) is a native Old World member of the nightshade family. This European diploid species can be found from marshlands to high mountainous regions and it is a common weed that serves as an alternative host and source of resistance genes against plant pathogens such as late blight (&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora infestans&lt;/i&gt;). We sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of bittersweet, which is 155,580 bp in length and it is characterized by a typical quadripartite structure composed of a large (85,901 bp) and small (18,449 bp) single-copy region interspersed by two identical inverted repeats (25,615 bp). It consists of 112 unique genes from which 81 are protein-coding, 27 tRNA and four rRNA genes. All bittersweet plastid genes including non-functional ones and even intergenic spacer regions are transcribed in primary plastid transcripts covering 95.22% of the genome. These are later substantially edited in a post-transcriptional phase to activate gene functions. By comparing the bittersweet plastid genome with all available Solanaceae sequences we found that gene content and synteny are highly conserved across the family. During genome comparison we have identified several annotation errors, which we have corrected in a manual curation process then we have identified the major plastid genome structural changes in Solanaceae. Interpreted in a phylogenetic context they seem to provide additional support for larger clades. The plastid genome sequence of bittersweet could help to benchmark Solanaceae plastid genome annotations and could be used as a reference for further studies. Such reliable annotations are important for gene diversity calculations, synteny map constructions and assigning partitions for phylogenetic analysis with de novo sequenced plastomes of Solanaceae.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524690000000</updated><fingerprint>aa621f38</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196069</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196069</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196069</originId><author><name>Ali Amiryousefi</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524690000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ali Amiryousefi, Jaakko Hyvönen, Péter Poczai&lt;/p&gt;

From the time when Henry Oldenburg published the first scientific journal in 1665 (&lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society&lt;/i&gt;) to the founding of the United States National Library of Medicine in 1879 to the present, there has been a sustained drive to improve how researchers can record and discover what is known.

In this work, we applied the EE‐GMFCC method for calculation of binding affinity of Endonuclease colicin–immunity protein complex. The binding free energy changes between the wild‐type and mutants of the complex calculated by EE‐GMFCC are in good agreement with experimental results. The correlation coefficient (R) between the predicted binding energy changes and experimental values is 0.906 at the B3LYP/6‐31G*‐D level, based on the snapshot whose binding affinity is closest to the average result from the molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculation. The inclusion of the QM effects is important for accurate prediction of protein–protein binding affinities. Moreover, the self‐consistent calculation of PB solvation energy is required for accurate calculations of protein–protein binding free energies. This study demonstrates that the EE‐GMFCC method is capable of providing reliable prediction of relative binding affinities for protein–protein complexes. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25236?af=R</originId><author><name>YaqianWang

The correlation coefficient (R) between the predicted binding energy changes and experimental values is 0.906 at the B3LYP/6‐31G*‐D level, based on the snapshot whose binding affinity is closest to the average result from the molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculation. The inclusion of the QM effects is important for accurate prediction of protein–protein binding affinities. Moreover, the self‐consistent calculation of PB solvation energy is required for accurate calculations of protein–protein binding free energies. This study demonstrates that the EE‐GMFCC method is capable of providing reliable prediction of relative binding affinities for protein–protein complexes. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25236?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00268/20180425/images/medium/bi-2018-00268u_0010.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>190</height></visual><title>[ASAP] Inhibition of Voltage-Gated K+ Channel Kv1.5 by Antiarrhythmic Drugs</title><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_162fe7494cc:49bad:ed160cc3</id><crawled>1524687475916</crawled><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>7af7c9ff</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00268/20180425/images/medium/bi-2018-00268u_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00268&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Anti-RhD immunised donors provide anti-RhD immunoglobulins used for the prevention of rhesus disease. These donors are periodically hyper-immunised (boostered) to retain a high titer level of anti-RhD.&lt;/p&gt; Study design and methods &lt;p&gt;We analysed anti-RhD donor records from 1998 to 2016, consisting of 30,116 anti-RhD titers from 755 donors, encompassing 3,372 booster events. Various models were fit to these data to allow describing the anti-RhD titers over time.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A random effects model with a log-linear anti-RhD titer decline over time and a saturating titer response to boostering is shown to fit the data well. This model contains two general model parameters, relating timing and maximum of the booster effect, as well as two parameters characterizing the individual donor, namely how fast the booster effect saturates with current titer and the anti-RhD decline rate. The average individual log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decline is 0.55 per year, i.e. a 32% decline in absolute titer, with half of the donors declining between 13% and 41% per year. Their anti-RhD titer peaks around 26 days following a booster event. Boostering response reduces with higher titers at boostering; at median titer (log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 11) the mean increase per booster is log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 0.38, that is from an absolute titer of 2048 to 2665 (+30%), with half of all donors increasing between 16% and 65% in their titer.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The model describes anti-RhD titer change per individual with only four parameters, two of which are donor specific. This information can be used to enhance the blood bank’s immunisation programme, by deriving individualized immunization policies in which boostering is adjusted to the anticipated anti-RhD decline, effectiveness of boostering and titer levels required.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524776400000</updated><fingerprint>10d9c8c0</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196382</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196382</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196382</originId><author><name>Anneke S. de Vos</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524776400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anneke S. de Vos, Ellen C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hypoactive lifestyle contributes to the development of secondary complications and lower quality of life in wheelchair users. There is a need for objective and user-friendly physical activity monitors for wheelchair-dependent individuals in order to increase physical activity through self-monitoring, goal setting, and feedback provision.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine the validity of Activ8 Activity Monitors to 1) distinguish two classes of activities: independent wheelchair propulsion from other non-propulsive wheelchair-related activities 2) distinguish five wheelchair-related classes of activities differing by the movement intensity level: sitting in a wheelchair (hands may be moving but wheelchair remains stationary), maneuvering, and normal, high speed or assisted wheelchair propulsion.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sixteen able-bodied individuals performed sixteen various standardized 60s-activities of daily living. Each participant was equipped with a set of two Activ8 Professional Activity Monitors, one at the right forearm and one at the right wheel. Task classification by the Active8 Monitors was validated using video recordings. For the overall agreement, sensitivity and positive predictive value, outcomes above 90% are considered excellent, between 70 and 90% good, and below 70% unsatisfactory.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Division in two classes resulted in overall agreement of 82.1%, sensitivity of 77.7% and positive predictive value of 78.2%. 84.5% of total duration of all tasks was classified identically by Activ8 and based on the video material. Division in five classes resulted in overall agreement of 56.6%, sensitivity of 52.8% and positive predictive value of 51.9%. 59.8% of total duration of all tasks was classified identically by Activ8 and based on the video material.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Activ8 system proved to be suitable for distinguishing between active wheelchair propulsion and other non-propulsive wheelchair-related activities.

Neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are apicobasally elongated and densely packed in the developing brain, systematically move their nuclei/somata in a cell cycle–dependent manner, called interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM): apical during G2 and basal during G1. Although intracellular molecular mechanisms of individual IKNM have been explored, how heterogeneous IKNMs are collectively coordinated is unknown. Our quantitative cell-biological and in silico analyses revealed that tissue elasticity mechanically assists an initial step of basalward IKNM. When the soma of an M-phase progenitor cell rounds up using actomyosin within the subapical space, a microzone within 10 μm from the surface, which is compressed and elastic because of the apical surface’s contractility, laterally pushes the densely neighboring processes of non–M-phase cells. The pressed processes then recoil centripetally and basally to propel the nuclei/somata of the progenitor’s daughter cells. Thus, indirect neighbor-assisted transfer of mechanical energy from mother to daughter helps efficient brain development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QIHSf4hXHfg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><fingerprint>d57d8d02</fingerprint><engagement>1</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004426</link><title>Elasticity-based boosting of neuroepithelial nucleokinesis via indirect energy transfer from mother to daughter</title><author><name>Tomoyasu Shinoda</name></author><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004426</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1524258000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoyasu Shinoda, Arata Nagasaka, Yasuhiro Inoue, Ryo Higuchi, Yoshiaki Minami, Kagayaki Kato, Makoto Suzuki, Takefumi Kondo, Takumi Kawaue, Kanako Saito, Naoto Ueno, Yugo Fukazawa, Masaharu Nagayama, Takashi Miura, Taiji Adachi, Takaki Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

Some epidemiological studies indicate that the use of mobile phones causes cancer in humans (in particular glioblastomas). It is known that DNA damage plays a key role in malignant transformation; therefore, we investigated the impact of the UMTS signal which is widely used in mobile telecommunications, on DNA stability in ten different human cell lines (six brain derived cell lines, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, liver and buccal tissue derived cells) under conditions relevant for users (SAR 0.25 to 1.00 W/kg). We found no evidence for induction of damage in single cell gel electrophoresis assays when the cells were cultivated with serum. However, clear positive effects were seen in a p53 proficient glioblastoma line (U87) when the cells were grown under serum free conditions, while no effects were found in p53 deficient glioblastoma cells (U251). Further experiments showed that the damage disappears rapidly in U87 and that exposure induced nucleotide excision repair (NER) and does not cause double strand breaks (DSBs). The observation of NER induction is supported by results of a proteome analysis indicating that several proteins involved in NER are up-regulated after exposure to UMTS; additionally, we found limited evidence for the activation of the γ-interferon pathway.

We examine the seasonality of asthma-related hospital admissions in Melbourne, Australia, in particular the contribution and predictability of episodic thunderstorm asthma. Using a time-series ecological approach based on asthma admissions to Melbourne metropolitan hospitals, we identified seasonal peaks in asthma admissions that were centred in late February, June and mid-November. These peaks were most likely due to the return to school, winter viral infections and seasonal allergies, respectively. We performed non-linear statistical regression to predict daily admission rates as functions of the seasonal cycle, weather conditions, reported thunderstorms, pollen counts and air quality. Important predictor variables were the seasonal cycle and mean relative humidity in the preceding two weeks, with higher humidity associated with higher asthma admissions. Although various attempts were made to model asthma admissions, none of the models explained substantially more variation above that associated with the annual cycle. We also identified a list of high asthma admissions days (HAADs). Most HAADs fell in the late-February return-to-school peak and the November allergy peak, with the latter containing the greatest number of daily admissions. Many HAADs in the spring allergy peak may represent episodes of thunderstorm asthma, as they were associated with rainfall, thunderstorms, high ambient grass pollen levels and high humidity, a finding that suggests thunderstorm asthma is a recurrent phenomenon in Melbourne that occurs roughly once per five years. The rarity of thunderstorm asthma events makes prediction challenging, underscoring the importance of maintaining high standards of asthma management, both for patients and health professionals, especially during late spring and early summer.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><fingerprint>684bff51</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194929</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194929</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194929</originId><author><name>Jeremy D.

The rise of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) techniques have sparked an increasing interest in the effects of weak extracellular electric fields on neural activity. These fields modulate ongoing neural activity through polarization of the neuronal membrane. While the somatic polarization has been investigated experimentally, the frequency-dependent polarization of the dendritic trees in the presence of alternating (AC) fields has received little attention yet. Using a biophysically detailed model with experimentally constrained active conductances, we analyze the subthreshold response of cortical pyramidal cells to weak AC fields, as induced during tCS. We observe a strong frequency resonance around 10-20 Hz in the apical dendrites sensitivity to polarize in response to electric fields but not in the basal dendrites nor the soma. To disentangle the relative roles of the cell morphology and active and passive membrane properties in this resonance, we perform a thorough analysis using simplified models, e.g. a passive pyramidal neuron model, simple passive cables and reconstructed cell model with simplified ion channels. We attribute the origin of the resonance in the apical dendrites to (i) a locally increased sensitivity due to the morphology and to (ii) the high density of h-type channels. Our systematic study provides an improved understanding of the subthreshold response of cortical cells to weak electric fields and, importantly, allows for an improved design of tCS stimuli.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J_BWXr6Snsg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525467600000</updated><fingerprint>370fdb24</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006124</link><title>Differential polarization of cortical pyramidal neuron dendrites through weak extracellular fields</title><author><name>Florian Aspart</name></author><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006124</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1525467600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Aspart, Michiel W.

Our systematic study provides an improved understanding of the subthreshold response of cortical cells to weak electric fields and, importantly, allows for an improved design of tCS stimuli.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J_BWXr6Snsg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/J_BWXr6Snsg/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005867</originId><recrawled>1524160804722</recrawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162df0f876e:4dc26a:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1524160759662</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zsolt Turi, Ivan Alekseichuk, Walter Paulus&lt;/p&gt;
The ability to simultaneously process and maintain multiple pieces of information is limited. Over the past 50 years, observational methods have provided a large amount of insight regarding the neural mechanisms that underpin the mental capacity that we refer to as “working memory.” More than 20 years ago, a neural coding scheme was proposed for working memory. As a result of technological developments, we can now not only observe but can also influence brain rhythms in humans. Building on these novel developments, we have begun to externally control brain oscillations in order to extend the limits of working memory.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZK-DqGkj6Do&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524171600000</updated><fingerprint>1fe5f1cc</fingerprint><engagement>12</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005867</link><title>On ways to overcome the magical capacity limit of working memory</title><author><name>Zsolt Turi</name></author><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005867</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1524171600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zsolt Turi, Ivan Alekseichuk, Walter Paulus&lt;/p&gt;

I remember coming across this one some years ago being surprised – I’d never heard that one myself, but it was apparently a pretty widespread fear. You could imagine a situation where tumor cells are mechanically detached and could spread, but that’s actually less likely than it might seem, since not all of these cells can actually attach somewhere else and start growing again (although there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicular-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html&quot;&gt;special situations&lt;/a&gt; where such disturbance, even to the level of taking a biopsy sample, is known to be risky).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t know enough about, though, is an effect seen in breast cancer treatment. After surgery, the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer peaks about 12 to 18 months later. It’s not a sure thing, fortunately, but it’s definitely a real effect, and one that would certainly lead to people thinking that the surgery had (somehow) spread the cancer around. That’s actually a pretty reasonable hypothesis, given the observations, so that particular “common myth” has something behind it. But how? The same effect is noted in patients who have undergone complete mastectomy, which doesn’t disturb the tumor tissue itself much (or at all). Alternatively, were these actively growing tumors that had spread before the surgery and were just too small to detect? Some have argued for this explanation, and it’s hard to disprove. There’s yet another plausible mechanism: these tumor cells might have had already spread before the surgery, but were somehow not growing, and something happened to change that. What is it about surgery that would allow them to start growing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/436/eaan3464&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has what may well be the answer. Studying the effects of surgery in mouse models of metastatic cancer, it appears that the post-surgical wound healing response is the culprit. There appears to be an ongoing T-cell response that is holding down these potential metastatic tumors, but it’s disrupted by the inflammation response after surgery. Expressing GFP in murine mammary tumors and then injecting these into other (syngenic) mice caused a T-cell response to the GFP itself, and ultimately the tumors were rejected by the immune system. But surgically wounding these mice triggered an outgrowth of the tumors instead, probably through the actions of inflammatory monocytes (which differentiate into macrophages inside the tumor tissue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s even more interesting is that these effects can be abrogated &lt;em&gt;simply by treating the mice with NSAIDs to damp down the inflammation response&lt;/em&gt;. To avoid interactions between the tumor cells and the anti-inflammatory drugs, the procedure was to do the surgical wounding (with and without NSAID treatment with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meloxicam&quot;&gt;meloxicam&lt;/a&gt;) several days before the tumor cells were even injected, with time enough to clear the system out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notably, treatment with meloxicam did not appear to impede wound healing in these mice. Seven days after surgical wounding (4 days after the cessation of either meloxicam or saline treatment), D2A1-GFP cells were orthotopically injected contralateral to the wound site. Meloxicam treatment had no effect on tumor growth in the absence of surgical wounding (Fig. 4G, left). In contrast, in wounded groups, tumors in meloxicam-treated mice were significantly smaller than tumors in wounded mice treated with saline (P &amp;lt; 0.05; Fig. 4G, right). Surprisingly, tumors in wounded, meloxicam-treated mice were even smaller than tumors in unwounded, untreated mice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there had been a retrospective study of breast cancer patients that suggested that treatment with NSAIDs seemed to reduce the metastatic events, but no one was sure if that was a direct mechanistic effect on pre-existing tumors, or on their possible activation. These results, though, suggest that it really is an activation mechanism, and that patients should be treated with NSAIDs in just this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We undertook to model a clinical phenomenon that occurs at low frequency and arises only with delayed kinetics in patients. We therefore used hundreds of mice to ensure that we had sufficient statistical power to draw firm conclusions. In considering these conclusions, we do not wish to suggest that tumor resection surgery be avoided because of the potentially negative side effects suggested previously by clinical data and demonstrated here experimentally. Instead, we argue that coupling surgery with short-term anti-inflammatory treatments may substantially improve patient outcomes by mitigating the systemic consequences of surgical breast cancer resection. Of critical importance, perioperative treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam potently inhibited the impact of wounding on tumor growth. Furthermore, our study suggests that the treatment of breast cancer patients with anti-inflammatory agents during and after surgical resection of primary tumors may yield substantial benefits by reducing the incidence of early metastatic relapse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no reason for this not to immediately move into clinical practice, and I hope that this paper gets widely noticed. NSAID therapy is cheap and well-tolerated, and the risk/benefit ratio would seem to be about as good as it can get. So in general, untangling the relationships of the immune system with cancer is continuing to provide results – both in turning the immune response up and (in this case) turning it down. That process is most definitely going to continue. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive weakness of the skeletal and cardiac muscles. This X-linked disorder is caused by open reading frame disrupting mutations in the DMD gene, resulting in strong reduction or complete absence of dystrophin protein. In order to use dystrophin as a supportive or even surrogate biomarker in clinical studies on investigational drugs aiming at correcting the primary cause of the disease, the ability to reliably quantify dystrophin expression in muscle biopsies of DMD patients pre- and post-treatment is essential. Here we demonstrate the application of the ProteinSimple capillary immunoassay (Wes) method, a gel- and blot-free method requiring less sample, antibody and time to run than conventional Western blot assay. We optimized dystrophin quantification by Wes using 2 different antibodies and found it to be highly sensitive, reproducible and quantitative over a large dynamic range. Using a healthy control muscle sample as a reference and α-actinin as a protein loading/muscle content control, a panel of skeletal muscle samples consisting of 31 healthy controls, 25 Becker Muscle dystrophy (BMD) and 17 DMD samples was subjected to Wes analysis. In healthy controls dystrophin levels varied 3 to 5-fold between the highest and lowest muscle samples, with the reference sample representing the average of all 31 samples. In BMD muscle samples dystrophin levels ranged from 10% to 90%, with an average of 33% of the healthy muscle average, while for the DMD samples the average dystrophin level was 1.3%, ranging from 0.7% to 7% of the healthy muscle average.

There is a severe lack of aphasia screening tools for bedside use in Chinese. A number of aphasia assessment tools have recently been developed abroad, but some of these scales were not suitable for patients with acute stroke. The Language Screening Test (which includes two parallel versions [a/b]) in French has been proven to be an effective and time-saving aphasia screening scale for early-stage stroke patients. Therefore, we worked out a Chinese version of the LAST taking into consideration Chinese language and culture. Two preliminary parallel versions (a/b) were tested on 154 patients with stroke at acute phase and 107 patients with stroke at non-acute phase, with the Western Aphasia Battery serving as a gold standard. The equivalence between the two parallel versions and the reliability/validity of each version were assessed. The median time to complete one preliminary Chinese version (each had some item redundancy) was 98 seconds. Two final parallel versions were established after adjustment/elimination of the redundant items and were found to be equivalent (intra-class correlation coefficient: 0.991). Internal consistency is(Cronbach α for each version [a/b] was 0.956 and 0.965, respectively) good. Internal validity was fine: (a) no floor or ceiling effect/item redundancy; (b) construct validity revealed a 1-dimension structure, just like the French version. The higher educated subjects scored higher than their lower educated counterparts (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;).

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main products of indigestible carbohydrates that are fermented by microbiota in the hindgut. This study was designed to investigate the effects of oral SCFAs administration on the lipid metabolism of weaned pigs. A total of 21 barrows were randomly allocated into three groups, including control group (orally infused with 200 mL physiological saline per day), low dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 20.04 mM, propionic acid 7.71 mM and butyric acid 4.89 mM per day), and high dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 40.08 mM, propionic acid 15.42 mM and butyric acid 9.78 mM per day). The results showed that the average daily feed intake of SCFAs groups were lower than that of control group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Oral administration of SCFAs decreased the concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and insulin (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased the leptin concentration in serum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). The total fat, as well as TC and TG levels in liver, was decreased by oral SCFAs administration (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In addition, SCFAs down-regulated the mRNA expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and enhanced the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α) in liver (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05).

These results suggested that oral administration of SCFAs could attenuate fat deposition in weaned pigs via reducing lipogenesis and enhancing lipolysis of different tissues.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196867</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>Explaining the apparent impenetrable barrier to ultra-relativistic electrons in the outer Van Allen belt</title><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16349504ae2:11dfaa6:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525943388898</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explaining the apparent impenetrable barrier to ultra-relativistic electrons in the outer Van Allen belt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining the apparent impenetrable barrier to ultra-relativistic electrons in the outer Van Allen belt, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04162-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04162-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The origin of the apparent impenetrable barrier in the outer Van Allen belt is still uncertain.

This study investigates the progress of highly cited research in China from 2001 to 2016 through the analysis of the Highly Cited database. The Highly Cited database, compiled by Clarivate Analytics, is comprised of the world’s most influential researchers in the 22 Essential Science Indicator fields as catalogued by the Web of Science. The database is considered an international standard for the measurement of national and institutional highly cited research output. Overall, we found a consistent and substantial increase in Highly Cited Researchers from China during the timespan. The Chinese institutions with the most Highly Cited Researchers- the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, Peking University, Zhejiang University, the University of Science and Technology of China, and BGI Shenzhen- are all top ten universities or primary government research institutions. Further evaluation of separate fields of research and government funding data from the National Natural Science Foundation of China revealed disproportionate growth efficiencies among the separate divisions of the National Natural Science Foundation. The most development occurred in the fields of Chemistry, Materials Sciences, and Engineering, whereas the least development occurred in Economics and Business, Health Sciences, and Life Sciences.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524603600000</updated><fingerprint>16209816</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196341</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196341</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196341</originId><author><name>John Tianci Li</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524603600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by John Tianci Li&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;This is the first report to characterize the prevalence and genovar distribution of genital chlamydial infections among random heterosexual patients in the multi-ethnic Saratov Region, located in Southeast Russia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sixty-one clinical samples (cervical or urethral swabs) collected from a random cohort of 856 patients (7.1%) were &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT) positive in commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and duplex TaqMan PCRs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Sequence analysis of the VDII region of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene revealed seven genovars of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; in PCR-positive patients. The overall genovars were distributed as E (41.9%), G (21.6%), F (13.5%), K (9.5%), D (6.8%), J (4.1%), and H (2.7%). CT-positive samples were from males (n = 12, 19.7%), females (n = 42, 68.8%), and anonymous (n = 7, 11.5%) patients, with an age range of 19 to 45 years (average 26.4), including 12 different ethnic groups representative of this region. Most patients were infected with a single genovar (82%), while 18% were co-infected with either two or three genovars. The 1156 bp-fragment of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene was sequenced in 46 samples to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among isolates. SNP-based subtyping and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the presence of 13 variants of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene, such as E (E1, E2, E6), G (G1, G2, G3, G5), F1, K, D (D1, Da2), J1, and H2. Differing genovar distribution was identified among urban (E&gt;G&gt;F) and rural (E&gt;K) populations, and in Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;D) and non-Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;K) ethnic groups. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) determined five sequences types (STs), such as ST4 (56%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 70.0 to 41.3), ST6 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3), ST9 (22%, 95% CI 35.9 to 11.5), ST10 (2%, 95% CI 10.7 to 0.05) and ST38 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3). Thus, the most common STs were ST4 and ST9.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; is a significant cause of morbidity among random heterosexual patients with genital chlamydial infections in the Saratov Region. Further studies should extend this investigation by describing trends in a larger population, both inside and outside of the Saratov Region to clarify some aspects for the actual application of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; genotype analysis for disease control.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523480400000</updated><fingerprint>318804a2</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195386</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195386</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195386</originId><author><name>Valentina A.

Differing genovar distribution was identified among urban (E&gt;G&gt;F) and rural (E&gt;K) populations, and in Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;D) and non-Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;K) ethnic groups. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) determined five sequences types (STs), such as ST4 (56%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 70.0 to 41.3), ST6 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3), ST9 (22%, 95% CI 35.9 to 11.5), ST10 (2%, 95% CI 10.7 to 0.05) and ST38 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3). Thus, the most common STs were ST4 and ST9.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; is a significant cause of morbidity among random heterosexual patients with genital chlamydial infections in the Saratov Region. Further studies should extend this investigation by describing trends in a larger population, both inside and outside of the Saratov Region to clarify some aspects for the actual application of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; genotype analysis for disease control.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195386</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Molecular dynamics simulations using the drude polarizable force field on GPUs with OpenMM: Implementation, validation, and benchmarks</title><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1633527c69f:221b4eb:5785ab88</id><crawled>1525605189279</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>1e5aa199</fingerprint><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25339?af=R</link><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><summary><content>Presented is the implementation of the Drude force field in the open‐source OpenMM simulation package allowing for access to graphical processing unit (GPU) hardware.

GABA is a robust regulator of both developing and mature neural networks. It exerts many of its effects through GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, which are heteropentamers assembled from a large array of subunits encoded by distinct genes. In mammals, there are 19 different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; subunit types, which are divided into the α, β, γ, δ, ε, π, θ and ρ subfamilies. The immense diversity of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors is not fully understood. However, it is known that specific isoforms, with their distinct biophysical properties and expression profiles, tune responses to GABA. Although larval zebrafish are well-established as a model system for neural circuit analysis, little is known about GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors diversity and expression in this system. Here, using database analysis, we show that the zebrafish genome contains at least 23 subunits. All but the mammalian θ and ε subunits have at least one zebrafish ortholog, while five mammalian GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits have two zebrafish orthologs. Zebrafish contain one subunit, β4, which does not have a clear mammalian ortholog. Similar to mammalian GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, the zebrafish α subfamily is the largest and most diverse of the subfamilies. In zebrafish there are eight α subunits, and RNA &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization across early zebrafish development revealed that they demonstrate distinct patterns of expression in the brain, spinal cord, and retina. Some subunits were very broadly distributed, whereas others were restricted to small populations of cells. Subunit-specific expression patterns in zebrafish resembled were those found in frogs and rodents, which suggests that the roles of different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor isoforms are largely conserved among vertebrates. This study provides a platform to examine isoform specific roles of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors within zebrafish neural circuits and it highlights the potential of this system to better understand the remarkable heterogeneity of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524862800000</updated><fingerprint>2cea1d92</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196083</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196083</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196083</originId><author><name>Bryan Monesson-Olson</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1524862800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bryan Monesson-Olson, Jon J.

Background &lt;p&gt;The survival rate of childhood cancer patients increased over the past decades. However, even after successful treatment the transition back to normalcy is often a major challenge for the whole family. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families in the first years after the end of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA Checklist (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017059782). In November 2016 and September 2017, we searched the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, and Web of Science. We included studies investigating psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors diagnosed under the age of 21, their family members or the family as a whole. Further, we summarized the study characteristics and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results. Finally, we assessed the study quality with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 8215 records based on our database searches and 17 additional records through hand searches. We included 33 articles in the qualitative synthesis. Most of the studies described interventions for the cancer survivor (n = 15). Nine studies investigated interventions for the whole family, and two studies interventions for siblings. The interventions mainly take place in an outpatient group setting (n = 15). Overall, most of the studies reported a significant psychosocial benefit of the interventions.

Background &lt;p&gt;The survival rate of childhood cancer patients increased over the past decades. However, even after successful treatment the transition back to normalcy is often a major challenge for the whole family. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families in the first years after the end of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA Checklist (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017059782). In November 2016 and September 2017, we searched the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, and Web of Science. We included studies investigating psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors diagnosed under the age of 21, their family members or the family as a whole. Further, we summarized the study characteristics and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results. Finally, we assessed the study quality with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 8215 records based on our database searches and 17 additional records through hand searches. We included 33 articles in the qualitative synthesis. Most of the studies described interventions for the cancer survivor (n = 15). Nine studies investigated interventions for the whole family, and two studies interventions for siblings. The interventions mainly take place in an outpatient group setting (n = 15). Overall, most of the studies reported a significant psychosocial benefit of the interventions. However, the quality of the included studies was limited.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In summary, we identified a broad range of different interventions and thus could give a comprehensive overview of existing interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families. However, there is a necessity for high quality studies. The results may help to optimize health care services that support families with the re-entry into daily life.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196151</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><title>[Research Articles] CD32 is expressed on cells with transcriptionally active HIV but does not enrich for HIV DNA in resting T cells</title><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_162d9f425c6:3bd58cd:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1524075079110</crawled><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;The persistence of HIV reservoirs, including latently infected, resting CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, is the major obstacle to cure HIV infection.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is known to provide neuroprotective effect in the central nervous system. However, the detailed mechanism remains far more elusive. This study was designed to investigate the relevant mechanisms of DEX&apos;s neuroprotective effect. Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were injected with dexmedetomidine and/or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally, and inflammatory cytokines in serum and in the hippocampus were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NF-κB in the brain tissue extracts was analyzed with western-blot. Then, we investigated whether NF-κB inhibitor prevents the elevation of inflammatory cytokines in rats injected with LPS. Our results indicated that compared with the control group, the rats exposed to LPS showed significant cognitive dysfunction. When compared to controls, the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the serum and hippocampus homogenate were increased in rats treated with LPS. DEX pretreatment inhibited the rats&apos; TNF-α, IL-6 and NF-κB levels induced by LPS. In response to LPS, PDTC pretreatment restrains the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6). Rats treated with PDTC and DEX alongside LPS exhibited less TNF-α and IL-6 than the LPS treated group. In combination, PDTC and DEX showed addictive effects. Our data suggest that DEX exerts a neuroprotective effect through NF-κB in part after LPS-induced cognitive dysfunction.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><fingerprint>c52f2985</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196897</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196897</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196897</originId><author><name>Xiaobao Zhang</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525381200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaobao Zhang, Fang Yan, Jiying Feng, Haitao Qian, Zhi Cheng, Qianqian Yang, Yong Wu, Zhibin Zhao, Aimin Li, Hang Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study is to disclose the potential bioactive components of &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, a native parasitic natural plant of flora palaestina and to open direction towards new prospective application. GC-MS analysis identified 18 components in the methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; for the first time. The most appealing among them are Sesamin and two other phytosterols (Campesterol and Stigmasterol), all of which are documented in the scientific literature for their anticancer activity. Quantitation of Sesamin extracted from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; by HPLC-PDA with the use of three organic solvents showed that the Sesamin content in the methanolic extract was the highest. Following the disclosure of Sesamin presence in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, we raised the question of whether it is produced naturally in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; or acquired from the host plant. The quantitation of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; was performed while being with five different host plants, and was compared with the amount of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; grown alone. The findings reveal that Sesamin is an endogenous secondary metabolite in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, further studies are required to prove if &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; can be used as an alternative source of anticancer phytochemicals, mainly Sesamin, and if proteins in the Sesamin production pathway could be valid biological targets for the development of novel and selective pesticides for control/ eradication of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; and maybe some other &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta&lt;/i&gt; species.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. Over the past several decades, many &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous and woody plants. However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (&lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt;) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><fingerprint>5fa2e0ac</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</originId><author><name>Chunhua Zhang</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><published>1523912400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chunhua Zhang, Ruchao Feng, Ruijuan Ma, Zhijun Shen, Zhixiang Cai, Zhizhong Song, Bin Peng, Mingliang Yu&lt;/p&gt;

Drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA) to prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are potent anti-inflammatory agents used widely in the treatment of joint and muscle pain. Despite their benefits, daily use of these drugs has been associated with hypertension, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities. It is now recognized that ARA is metabolized to a number of bioactive oxygenated lipids (oxylipins) by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Currently, the contribution of individual variability in ARA metabolism in response to the COX-2 inhibitors and potential adverse effects remains poorly understood. Using patient samples from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III selenium/celecoxib (Sel/Cel) trial for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we analyzed plasma concentrations of 74 oxylipins in a subset of participants who received celecoxib (n = 90) or placebo (n = 95). We assessed the effect of celecoxib (with and without low dose aspirin) on circulating oxylipins and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Individual CYP450- and LOX- but not COX-derived metabolites were higher with celecoxib than placebo (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) and differences were greater among non-aspirin users. LOX derived 5- and 8-HETE were elevated with celecoxib and positively associated with systolic blood pressure (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011 and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019 respectively). 20-HETE, a prohypertensive androgen-sensitive CYP450 metabolite was higher with celecoxib absent aspirin and was positively associated with SBP in men (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.040) but not women. Independent of celecoxib or aspirin, LOX derived metabolites from ARA were strongly associated with SBP including 5- and 8-HETE. These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524776400000</updated><fingerprint>21014197</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196398</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196398</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196398</originId><author><name>Jessica A.

These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196398</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item></channel></rss>
