Objective &lt;p&gt;We investigated the characteristics of pediatric emergency department (ED) patients in Korea and determined factors associated with hospital admission after ED treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Korea Health Panel data from 2008 through 2013 were analyzed retrospectively; we included patients under 18 years old who visited the ED at least once. We collected patient and household epidemiologic data such as sex, age group, region of residence, disability, chronic disease, household income quintile, national health insurance type, use of private insurance, and annual frequency of ED visits. We also examined data related to each ED visit, such as reason for visit, medical service provided, and hospital size/ownership. We then investigated which factors were correlated with case disposition (discharge home or hospital admission) after ED treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 3,160 pediatric ED visits occurred during the six-year period. Males (57.5%) and children aged 0–5 years (47.7%) made more visits than females and older children, respectively. The proportion of ED visits for disease (67.7%) was much higher than for injury or poisoning (32.2%), and 452 cases (14.3%) required hospital admission. For hospital admission, the odds ratio (OR) of females was 0.73 compared to males, and the OR of children aged 6–11 was 0.68 compared to children aged 0–5. The OR of capital residents was 0.69 compared to province residents, and the OR of the highest income quintile was 0.51 compared to the lowest quintile. The OR of children with private insurance coverage was 0.49 compared to those lacking private insurance, and the OR of ED visits due to disease was 1.82 compared to visits due to injury/poisoning.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This analysis of clinical and demographic characteristics of pediatric ED visits and hospital admissions can serve as the foundation of future prospective studies required for establishing appropriate policies for the Korean pediatric emergency medical system.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197929</originId><fingerprint>a96ee459</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197929</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dong Hyun Seo, Min Joung Kim, Kyung Hwan Kim, Junseok Park, Dong Wun Shin, Hoon Kim, Woochan Jeon, Hyunjong Kim, Joon Min Park&lt;/p&gt;

Primary brain microvessels (BrMV) maintain the cellular characters and molecular signatures as displayed in vivo, and serve as a vital tool for biomedical research of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the development/optimization of brain drug delivery. The variations of relative purities or cellular composition among different BrMV samples may have significant consequences in data interpretation and research outcome, especially for experiments with high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable reference gene (RG) for accurate normalization of real-time RT-qPCR analysis, and determine the proper marker genes (MG) for relative purity assessment in BrMV samples. Out of five housekeeping genes, β-actin was selected as the most suitable RG that was validated by quantifying mRNA levels of alpha-L-iduronidase in BrMV isolated from mice with one or two expressing alleles. Four marker genes highly/selectively expressed in BBB-forming capillary endothelial cells were evaluated by RT-qPCR for purity assessment, resulting in &lt;i&gt;Cldn&lt;/i&gt;5 and &lt;i&gt;Pecam1&lt;/i&gt; as most suitable MGs that were further confirmed by immunofluorescent analysis of cellular components. &lt;i&gt;Plvap&lt;/i&gt; proved to be an indicator gene for the presence of fenestrated vessels in BrMV samples. This study may contribute to the building blocks toward overarching research needs on the blood-brain barrier.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197379</originId><fingerprint>2e53d51</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197379</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mei Dai, Yi Lin, Salim S.

Two-pore domain K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt;) are responsible for background K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents and regulate the resting membrane potential and cellular excitability. Their activity is controlled by a large variety of physicochemical factors and intracellular signaling pathways. The majority of these effects converge on the intracellular C-terminus of the channels, resulting in the modification of the gating at the selectivity filter. Another gating mechanism, the activation gate at the helix bundle crossing is also well documented in other K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel families, however, it remains uncertain whether this type of gating is functional in K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. The regulation of TWIK-related spinal cord K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (TRESK) is different from the other K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. Regulatory factors acting via the C-terminus are not known, instead channel activity is modified by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the unusually long intracellular loop between the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; transmembrane segments. These unique structural elements of the regulation lead us to examine channel gating at the bundle crossing region.

We compared the kinetics of the development of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; block when the channels were phosphorylated (inhibited) or dephosphorylated (activated) and also in different mutants mimicking the two functional states. Neither the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation nor the point mutations influenced the development of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; block, suggesting that the conformational changes of the bundle crossing region do not contribute to the phosphorylation-dependent gating of TRESK.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197622</originId><fingerprint>d2ee7790</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197622</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miklós Lengyel, Gábor Czirják, Péter Enyedi&lt;/p&gt;

The Poisson channel is an important communication model for such noisy interactions, providing a fundamental link between timing precision, information transfer and the rate of signalling. Constraints on this rate limit the Poisson channel capacity, which in turn bounds the precision with which molecular networks can solve estimation problems.

The simplest of these networks commonly models the dynamics of long-lived proteins. Birth-following is therefore an important reference strategy when the maximum signalling rate is high and the mean rate is no smaller than that of the target molecule. Discreteness is important in this regime. We examine the limit of this regime by removing the maximum signalling constraint.

There are no defined correlates of protection for any intracellular pathogen, including the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/i&gt;, which causes tularemia. Evaluating vaccine efficacy against sporadic diseases like tularemia using field trials is problematic, and therefore alternative strategies to test vaccine candidates like the &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; Live Vaccine Strain (LVS), such as testing in animals and applying correlate measurements, are needed. Recently, we described a promising correlate strategy that predicted the degree of vaccine-induced protection in mice given parenteral challenges, primarily when using an attenuated &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; strain. Here, we demonstrate that using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in this approach predicts LVS-mediated protection against respiratory challenge of Fischer 344 rats with fully virulent &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tularensis&lt;/i&gt;, with exceptional sensitivity and specificity. Rats were vaccinated with a panel of LVS-derived vaccines and subsequently given lethal respiratory challenges with Type A &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tularensis&lt;/i&gt;. In parallel, PBLs from vaccinated rats were evaluated for their functional ability to control intramacrophage &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; growth in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; co-culture assays. PBLs recovered from co-cultures were also evaluated for relative gene expression using a large panel of genes identified in murine studies. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; control of LVS intramacrophage replication reflected the hierarchy of protection. Further, despite variability between individuals, 22 genes were significantly more up-regulated in PBLs from rats vaccinated with LVS compared to those from rats vaccinated with the variant LVS-R or heat-killed LVS, which were poorly protective. These genes included IFN-γ, IL-21, NOS2, LTA, T-bet, IL-12rβ2, and CCL5. Most importantly, combining quantifications of intramacrophage growth control with 5–7 gene expression levels using multivariate analyses discriminated protected from non-protected individuals with greater than 95% sensitivity and specificity. The results therefore support translation of this approach to non-human primates and people to evaluate new vaccines against &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; and other intracellular pathogens.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198140</originId><fingerprint>112a33f3</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198140</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Roberto De Pascalis, Andrew Hahn, Helen M.

The results therefore support translation of this approach to non-human primates and people to evaluate new vaccines against &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; and other intracellular pathogens.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>A panel of correlates predicts vaccine-induced protection of rats against respiratory challenge with virulent &amp;lt;i&gt;Francisella tularensis&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1527282000000</updated></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16365e0271a:3b0b8f2:3dd877af</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25618-y</link><author><name>Estefânia V.

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Advanced liver fibrosis is an important predictor of liver disease progression and mortality, and current guidelines recommend screening for complications of cirrhosis once patients develop F3 fibrosis.

The UK Biobank is one of a number of projects that have used BGEN for release of imputed data, and we expect the format to continue to be widely implemented and used.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>BGEN: a binary file format for imputed genotype and haplotype data [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1630b2b1723:100d5e8:fc1f8953</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019383?af=R</link><author><name>Aaron W.

Psychological factors including pain catastrophizing and resilience associate with adjustment and quality of life in people living with chronic pain. Nevertheless, their presentation among females living with HIV and chronic pain has been poorly studied. Given that chronic pain in those living with HIV might occur due to different mechanisms (nociceptive or neuropathic), we hypothesize that the associated psychological states could also differ between these groups. We aimed to compare pain frequency and interference, psychological factors and sleep quality between females living with chronic nociceptive or neuropathic pain. Also, we explored correlations between psychological factors, pain severity and interference in females living with HIV and chronic pain. We performed a cross sectional study assessing females living with HIV and chronic pain, and compared it with a female HIV-positive, pain-free control sample in Brazil. To discriminate the most likely underlying mechanism for the chronic pain, we applied the Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Signs and Symptoms (LANSS). Forty-nine females living with HIV and chronic pain were assessed, and divided in control (n = 12), nociceptive (n = 10) and neuropathic pain (n = 27) groups. Using validated scales, their pain catastrophizing, resilience, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders were assessed between May 2014 and August 2015. Compared to controls, females living with HIV and neuropathic chronic pain had higher pain frequency (p&amp;lt;0.001), interference on activities (p = 0.002), interference with emotions (p&amp;lt;0.001), catastrophizing (p&amp;lt;0.001), depression (p = 0.015), and lower resilience (p = 0.011). Catastrophizing was also significantly correlated to the burden of chronic pain. The type of chronic pain in females living with HIV should raise concerns regarding significant burden in psychological states in this population (particularly neuropathic pain). Using scales such as the LANSS to identify the type of choric pain, could be of use to address relevant issues for the patients, and to propose tailored therapies.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196718</originId><fingerprint>e983082b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196718</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andressa de Souza, Wolnei Caumo, Prisla Ucker Calvetti, Rachel Nunes Lorenzoni, Gisele Keller da Rosa, Alexandre Ramos Lazzarotto, Jairo Alberto Dussan-Sarria&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

Currently, nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) with short pulse duration and non-thermal effects have various potential applications in medicine and biology, especially in tumor ablation. Additionally, there are a few investigations on its proliferative effects in the normal cell. Clinically, proliferation of endothelial cells can perhaps accelerate the stent endothelialization and reduce the risk of acute thrombosis. To explore the feasibility using nsPEFs to induce proliferation of endothelial cells, in this study, porcine iliac endothelial (PIEC) cell line was cultured and tested by CCK-8 assay after nsPEFs treatment. The results reflected that nsPEFs with low field strength (100ns, 5 kV/cm, 10 pulses) had a significant proliferative effect with an increase in the PIEC cell growth of 16% after a 48 hour’ post-treatment. To further understand the mechanism of cell proliferation, intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration was measured through fluo-4 AM and reactive oxygen species assay was applied to estimate the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the total nitric oxide assay for NO production in the cultured medium was evaluated. An enhanced concentration of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and ROS were observed, while the concentration of extracellular NO also increased after nsPEFs treatment. Such experimental results demonstrated that nsPEFs with appropriate pulse parameters could effectively enhance cell proliferation on PIEC cells, and the cell proliferation associated strongly with the changes of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concertation, ROS and NO production induced by nsPEFs treatment. This in vitro preliminary study indicates that as a novel physical doping, the nsPEFs have potential in stimulating endothelial cells to accelerate stent endothelialization.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196688</originId><fingerprint>7513da5f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196688</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuchen Zhang, Feihong Dong, Zhengxin Liu, Jinsong Guo, Jue Zhang, Jing Fang&lt;/p&gt;

An enhanced concentration of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and ROS were observed, while the concentration of extracellular NO also increased after nsPEFs treatment. Such experimental results demonstrated that nsPEFs with appropriate pulse parameters could effectively enhance cell proliferation on PIEC cells, and the cell proliferation associated strongly with the changes of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concertation, ROS and NO production induced by nsPEFs treatment. This in vitro preliminary study indicates that as a novel physical doping, the nsPEFs have potential in stimulating endothelial cells to accelerate stent endothelialization.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Nanosecond pulsed electric fields promoting the proliferation of porcine iliac endothelial cells: An in vitro study</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525208400000</updated></item><item><id>nWAmhAfvfdY6zhQafSMhdWASYooG1IX3uplCe3rnLYA=_16318c66798:ca2fb:c2c34441</id><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00325</link><author><name>David De Sancho, Adam Kubas, Po-Hung Wang, Jochen Blumberger, Robert B.

In pathology, Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of tissue sections is regularly used to diagnose and grade malignant tumors. Typically, IHC stain interpretation is rendered by a trained pathologist using a manual method, which consists of counting each positively- and negatively-stained cell under a microscope. The manual enumeration suffers from poor reproducibility even in the hands of expert pathologists. To facilitate this process, we propose a novel method to create artificial datasets with the known ground truth which allows us to analyze the recall, precision, accuracy, and intra- and inter-observer variability in a systematic manner, enabling us to compare different computer analysis approaches. Our method employs a conditional Generative Adversarial Network that uses a database of Ki67 stained tissues of breast cancer patients to generate synthetic digital slides. Our experiments show that synthetic images are indistinguishable from real images. Six readers (three pathologists and three image analysts) tried to differentiate 15 real from 15 synthetic images and the probability that the average reader would be able to correctly classify an image as synthetic or real more than 50% of the time was only 44.7%.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196846</originId><fingerprint>cd2857f3</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196846</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Caglar Senaras, Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi, Berkman Sahiner, Michael P.

The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, have been used as lipid lowering drugs for decades and several epidemiological studies suggest statin usage correlates with a decreased incidence of cancer specific mortality in patients. However, the mechanism of this mortality benefit remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that statin drug lipophilicity and affinity for its target enzyme, HMGCR, determine their growth suppressive potency against various tumor cell lines. The lipophilic atorvastatin decreases cancer cell proliferation and survival &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Statin sensitivity coincided with Ras localization to the cytosol instead of the membrane, consistent with a decrement in prenylation. To investigate signaling pathways that may be involved with sensitivity to statin therapy, we employed inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt and Mek-Erk signaling cascades. We found that inhibition of PI3K signaling through Akt potentiated statin sensitivity of breast cancer cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in co-culture with primary human hepatocytes. The same effect was not observed with inhibition of Mek signaling through Erk. Moreover, the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to atorvastatin-mediated growth suppression correlated with a decrease in EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. As an increase in Akt activity has been shown to be involved in the metastasis and metastatic outgrowth of many cancer types (including breast), these data suggest a mechanism by which statins may reduce cancer specific mortality in patients.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197422</originId><fingerprint>b429563c</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197422</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Colin H.

As an increase in Akt activity has been shown to be involved in the metastasis and metastatic outgrowth of many cancer types (including breast), these data suggest a mechanism by which statins may reduce cancer specific mortality in patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Lipophilic statins limit cancer cell growth and survival, via involvement of Akt signaling</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526418000000</updated></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163745b5a71:521e72b:3dd877af</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/258814v2?rss=1</link><author><name>Zitnik, M.</name></author><published>1526626800000</published><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/18/258814</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526665534065</crawled><description>The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common to treat patients with complex diseases or co-existing conditions. However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change, favorably or unfavorably, if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is often limited because these complex relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality and morbidity. Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal networks. Unlike approaches limited to predicting simple drug-drug interaction values, Decagon can predict the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well polypharmacy side effects that have a strong molecular basis, while on predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon opens up opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient population data to flag and prioritize polypharmacy side effects for follow-up analysis via formal pharmacological studies.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/258814v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>c5ee0d2d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/258814v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common to treat patients with complex diseases or co-existing conditions.

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196984</originId><fingerprint>1199cc1d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196984</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;

Immunogenicity is a major concern in drug development as anti-drug antibodies in many cases affect both patient safety and drug efficacy. Another concern is often the limited half-life of drugs, which can be altered by different chemical modifications, like acylation with fatty acids. However, acylation with fatty acids has been shown in some cases to modulate T cell activation. Therefore, to understand the role of acylation with fatty acids on immunogenicity we tested three immunogenic non-acylated peptides and 14 of their acylated analogues for binding to 26 common HLA class II alleles, and their ability to activate T cells in an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; T cell assay. Changes in binding affinity associated with acylation with fatty acids were typically modest, though a significant decrease was observed for influenza HA acylated with a stearic acid, and affinities for DQ alleles were consistently increased. Importantly, we showed that for all three immunogenic peptides acylation with fatty acids decreased their capacity to activate T cells, a trend particularly evident with longer fatty acids typically positioned within the peptide HLA class II binding core region, or when closer to the C-terminus. With these results we have demonstrated that acylation with fatty acids of immunogenic peptides can lower their stimulatory capacity, which could be important knowledge for drug design and immunogenicity mitigation.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197407</originId><fingerprint>301ad1eb</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197407</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Heidi S.

This work aims at corroborating the importance and efficacy of mutual learning in motor imagery (MI) brain–computer interface (BCI) by leveraging the insights obtained through our participation in the BCI race of the Cybathlon event. We hypothesized that, contrary to the popular trend of focusing mostly on the machine learning aspects of MI BCI training, a comprehensive mutual learning methodology that reinstates the three learning pillars (at the machine, subject, and application level) as equally significant could lead to a BCI–user symbiotic system able to succeed in real-world scenarios such as the Cybathlon event. Two severely impaired participants with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), were trained following our mutual learning approach to control their avatar in a virtual BCI race game. The competition outcomes substantiate the effectiveness of this type of training. Most importantly, the present study is one among very few to provide multifaceted evidence on the efficacy of subject learning during BCI training. Learning correlates could be derived at all levels of the interface—application, BCI output, and electroencephalography (EEG) neuroimaging—with two end-users, sufficiently longitudinal evaluation, and, importantly, under real-world and even adverse conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/XSdFB8wknvs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003787</link><crawled>1525974546490</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003787</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003787</originId><fingerprint>55657e49</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/XSdFB8wknvs/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Serafeim Perdikis, Luca Tonin, Sareh Saeedi, Christoph Schneider, José del R.

Understanding what determines species’ geographic distributions is crucial for assessing global change threats to biodiversity. Measuring limits on distributions is usually, and necessarily, done with data at large geographic extents and coarse spatial resolution. However, survival of individuals is determined by processes that happen at small spatial scales. The relative abundance of coexisting species (i.e. ‘community structure’) reflects assembly processes occurring at small scales, and are often available for relatively extensive areas, so could be useful for explaining species distributions. We demonstrate that Bayesian Network Inference (BNI) can overcome several challenges to including community structure into studies of species distributions, despite having been little used to date. We hypothesized that the relative abundance of coexisting species can improve predictions of species distributions. In 1570 assemblages of 68 Mediterranean woody plant species we used BNI to incorporate community structure into Species Distribution Models (SDMs), alongside environmental information. Information on species associations improved SDM predictions of community structure and species distributions moderately, though for some habitat specialists the deviance explained increased by up to 15%. We demonstrate that most species associations (95%) were positive and occurred between species with ecologically similar traits. This suggests that SDM improvement could be because species co-occurrences are a proxy for local ecological processes. Our study shows that Bayesian Networks, when interpreted carefully, can be used to include local conditions into measurements of species’ large-scale distributions, and this information can improve the predictions of species distributions.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197877</originId><fingerprint>a01c6413</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197877</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alicia Montesinos-Navarro, Alba Estrada, Xavier Font, Miguel G.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Studies of community-based obesity prevention interventions have hypothesized that stakeholder networks are a critical element of effective implementation. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the interpersonal network structures within a sub-sample of stakeholders from two past successful childhood obesity prevention interventions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Participants were recruited from the stakeholder groups (steering committees) of two completed community-based intervention studies, Romp &amp;amp; Chomp (R&amp;amp;C), Australia (2004-2008) and Shape Up Somerville (SUS), USA (2003-2005). Both studies demonstrated significant reductions of overweight and obesity among children. Members of the steering committees were asked to complete a retrospective social network questionnaire using a roster of other committee members and free recall. Each participant was asked to recall the people with whom they discussed issues related to childhood obesity throughout the intervention period, along with providing the closeness and level of influence of each relationship.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Networks were reported by 13 participants from the SUS steering committee and 8 participants from the R&amp;amp;C steering committee. On average, participants nominated 16 contacts with whom they discussed issues related to childhood obesity through the intervention, with approximately half of the relationships described as ‘close’ and 30% as ‘influential’. The ‘discussion’ and ‘close’ networks had high clustering and reciprocity, with ties directed to other steering committee members, and to individuals external to the committee.

Surface waters are important sources of water for drinking, industrial, agricultural, and recreational uses; hence, contamination of water by fecal, pathogenic, or antimicrobial resistant (AR) bacteria is a major environmental and public health concern. However, very little data is available on prevalence of these bacteria in surface water throughout a watershed. This study aimed to characterize &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; present in the Upper Oconee Watershed, a mixed-use watershed in Athens, GA, USA for potential pathogenicity and AR. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; were enumerated by colony counts, cultured by enrichment and direct plating, and characterized by phylo-groups, diarrheagenic pathotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibility. From the analysis, 99.3% (455/458) of the total samples were positive for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; resulting in 496 isolates. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; counts were as high as 1.2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU/100 ml, which is above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) threshold for recreational water (235 CFU/100 ml based on a one-time measurement).

Surface waters are important sources of water for drinking, industrial, agricultural, and recreational uses; hence, contamination of water by fecal, pathogenic, or antimicrobial resistant (AR) bacteria is a major environmental and public health concern. However, very little data is available on prevalence of these bacteria in surface water throughout a watershed. This study aimed to characterize &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; present in the Upper Oconee Watershed, a mixed-use watershed in Athens, GA, USA for potential pathogenicity and AR. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; were enumerated by colony counts, cultured by enrichment and direct plating, and characterized by phylo-groups, diarrheagenic pathotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibility. From the analysis, 99.3% (455/458) of the total samples were positive for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; resulting in 496 isolates. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; counts were as high as 1.2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU/100 ml, which is above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) threshold for recreational water (235 CFU/100 ml based on a one-time measurement). Phylo-groups B2 (31.7%; 157/496) and B1 (30.8%; 153/496) were the most prevalent among the isolates. Enteropathogenic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (EPEC) (19/496) and Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) (1/496) were the only diarrheagenic pathotypes detected.

You may be wondering how that works, or how it can possibly work, especially when you hear that the nanoscale reactions are transition-metal catalyzed. After all, we usually spend a good deal of effort trying to make sure that our assay candidates are cleaned up and (most especially) free of metal contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is the type of protein assay. It’s not a functional readout, which is where the metals can give you all sorts of false positives, but rather just a binding assay, done by mass spec. That’s generally done in an is-anything-there binary mode, but in this paper, they’re actually titrating in the amount of protein to get a rough order of affinities. Still, one strike against that sort of detection has always been “But you’re only measuring binding, not real inhibition, etc.” That’s still true, but now you can always consider going the targeted protein degradation route, in which case all you need is some sort of binder. As mentioned here in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/26/dna-libraries-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;another recent post&lt;/a&gt;, the same consideration applies to DNA-encoded libraries, which also just give you a binding affinity readout – the Merck authors don’t mention this aspect, but it’s a real consideration these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, they did a test with 20 reactions each using amide formation, Suzuki couplings, and Buchwald-Hartwig C-N couplings (which certainly cover a lot of real-world medicinal chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/24/boring-or-the-medicinal-chemists-toolkit&quot;&gt;for better or worse&lt;/a&gt;).  They used the small-scale reaction setup to screen conditions for the latter two, in a smaller-scale version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. In each case, they also synthesized the products on a 20mg scale and purified them by traditional means, in order to compare them with the nanoscale assay results. (These all produced compounds in known kinase inhibitor space, which I’m afraid is also pretty realistic.) And the correlation was strong: the affinity-mass-spec assay could indeed pick out the potent compounds (as it should) without giving false positives along the way (since you’re looking for the particular mass signature of the product associated with the enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this confirmation in hand, the group then took one of the intermediates and coupled it in each individual well of a 384 plate after an automated reaction conditions screen. They got 345 products and rank-ordered them by titrating in CHK1 protein, with a mass spec readout each time, and identified three new potent binders. These reactions are done on about 0.05mg of material each, so you can plow through quite a few of them without plowing through a lot of starting material, and generate a lot of SAR data rather quickly. The reaction screening is a key part of the process – taking robust but generic coupling conditions across that same 384 set only gave 158 products (and thus missed several nanomolar inhibitors). Overall, to optimize the 384 set and assay them took 3114 reactions, consuming about 120mg of the starting material. You are not going to be able to do that by hand. I don’t care how much of a machine you are in the lab, you’re not more of a machine than a machine is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors note, machine-learning algorithms may eventually make it easier to navigate both reaction condition space and SAR space, but for now, we really have to attack these things empirically, and this (in general) seems like the way to do it. Small scale, highly automated, optimized, high-throughput: you’re not going to be able to sort things so thoroughly any other way. And since we often have to resort to brute force, we should be letting the machines take that on whenever possible, because brute force is exactly what they do the best. That was proven on the high-throughput screening end of the business many years ago, and it’s true on the compound synthesis end of things, too. Bring ’em on.&lt;/p&gt;

Avian embryos are among the most convenient and the primary representatives for the study of classical embryology. It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2°C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196973</originId><fingerprint>118f9c95</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196973</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chompunut Lumsangkul, Yang-Kwang Fan, Shen-Chang Chang, Jyh-Cherng Ju, Hsin-I.

Around 70% of circulating alpha-2-antiplasmin (α2AP), the main natural plasmin inhibitor, is N-terminally cleaved between residues Pro12 and Asn13 by antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme. This converts native Met-α2AP into the more potent fibrinolysis inhibitor Asn-α2AP. The Arg6Trp (R6W) polymorphism affects the N-terminal cleavage rate of Met-α2AP in a purified system, with ~8-fold faster conversion of Met(R6)-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP. To date, assays to determine N-terminally intact Met-α2AP in plasma have been limited to an ELISA that only measures Met(R6)-α2AP. The aim of this study was to generate and characterize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and all α2AP forms (total-α2AP) in order to develop specific Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP ELISAs. Recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and Asn-α2AP were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. Using hybridoma technology, a panel of 25 mAbs was generated against a mixture of recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP. All mAbs were evaluated for their specific reactivity using the three recombinant α2APs in one-site non-competitive ELISAs. Three mAbs were selected to develop sandwich-type ELISAs. MA-AP37E2 and MA-AP34C4 were selected for their specific reactivity against Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, and used for coating. MA-AP15D7 was selected for its reactivity against total-α2AP and used for detection. With the novel ELISAs we determined Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP levels in plasma samples and we showed that Met(R6)-α2AP was converted faster into Asn-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP in a plasma milieu. In conclusion, we developed two specific ELISAs for Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, in plasma. This will enable us to determine N-terminal heterogeneity of α2AP in plasma samples.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196911</originId><fingerprint>e8049f69</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196911</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shiraazkhan Abdul, Miet Peeters, Els Brouwers, Joyce J.

We use as a case study gene Transcription Start Sites (TSS) and show that a model trained on one organism (e.g. human) can be used to predict TSS in a different specie (e.g. mouse).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Genome Functional Annotation using Deep Convolutional Neural Network [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_1632dc3adbc:477bf:23fa95f2</id><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00277</link><author><name>Cassandra Herbert, Yannick Kokouvi Dzowo, Anthony Urban, Courtney N.

Since endophytes can affect metabolism of host plants, they are expected to be used to improve crop quality, especially for crops with organoleptic sensitive products such as wine grape. However, details of metabolic interactions between endophytes and host plants were less understood. In this work, we used high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the metabolites of fruit flesh cells of grape treated with dual culture of different endophytic fungal strains (EFS). We observed that the dual-culture with different fungal strains show different metabolites composition in grape cells. In response to different EFS, quantities of detected metabolites in grape cells varied from 6 to 17 in this assay, and 1 to 11 novel metabolites were introduced into metabolome of grape cells. Dual-culture with fungal strains CS2, RH16 and RH5 introduced the highest quantities (10 or 11) of novel metabolites in grape cells. More importantly, the modification of metabolic profiles in grape cells &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; fungal endophytes appeared to be fungal strain/genus-specificity. Overall, this work revealed that introduction of specific metabolites in host plants may be one consequence during the process of endophytes-host metabolic interactions, which raise the possibility to shape grape qualities and characteristics using tool of fungal endophytes.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196996</originId><fingerprint>877f65dc</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196996</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Li-Hua Huang, Ming-Quan Yuan, Xiu-Jin Ao, An-Yun Ren, Han-Bo Zhang, Ming-Zhi Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</link><crawled>1525801275042</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</originId><fingerprint>3e9b2388</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sNFhadDEsvQ/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew E.

The inherent thermal stability of nanograins originates from an autonomous grain boundary evolution to low-energy states due to activation of partial dislocations in plastic deformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><keywords><item>Materials Science</item></keywords><title>Enhanced thermal stability of nanograined metals below a critical grain size</title><unread>True</unread><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16381f77d24:6535e3d:2835af05</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26323-6</link><author><name>Yaogai Lv</name></author><published>1526886000000</published><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26323-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26323-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Xp2dftH9ge8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1526893870372</crawled><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26323-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26323-6</originId><fingerprint>4860c184</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/Xp2dftH9ge8/s41598-018-26323-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26323-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26323-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Xp2dftH9ge8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26323-6/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26323_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><height>212</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16397e87de2:4f1260:2835af05</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/278226v2?rss=1</link><author><name>Innocentini, G.</name></author><published>1527231600000</published><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/25/278226</canonicalUrl><crawled>1527261986274</crawled><description>We discuss piecewise-deterministic approximations of gene networks dynamics.

The rate at which an element in a metabolic network accumulates genetic variation via new mutations depends on both the size of the mutational target it presents and its robustness to mutational perturbation. Quantifying the relationship between topological properties of network elements and the mutability of those elements will facilitate understanding the variation in and evolution of networks at the level of populations and higher taxa. We report an investigation into the relationship between two topological properties of 29 metabolites in the C. elegans metabolic network and the sensitivity of those metabolites to the cumulative effects of spontaneous mutation. The correlations between measures of network centrality and mutability are not statistically significant, but several trends point toward a weak positive association between network centrality and mutational sensitivity. There is a small but significant negative association between the mutational correlation of a pair of metabolites (rM) and the shortest path length between those metabolites. Positive association between the centrality of a metabolite and its mutational heritability is consistent with centrally-positioned metabolites presenting a larger mutational target than peripheral ones, and is inconsistent with centrality conferring mutational robustness, at least in toto. The weakness of the correlation between rM and the shortest path length between pairs of metabolites suggests that network locality is an important but not overwhelming factor governing mutational pleiotropy. These findings provide necessary background against which the effects of other evolutionary forces, most importantly natural selection, can be interpreted.</description><crawled>1527541729137</crawled><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/181511v5?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>3625860</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/181511v5?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>A fundamental issue in evolutionary systems biology is understanding the relationship between the topological architecture of a biological network, such as a metabolic network, and the evolution of the network.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To facilitate precise local ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a setting of combined ablation and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), we evaluated accuracy and efficiency of a novel technique for navigated positioning of ablation probes using intrahepatic tumor referencing and electromagnetic (EM) guidance, in a porcine model.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An angiographic wire with integrated EM reference sensor at its tip was inserted via a transarterial femoral access and positioned in the vicinity of artificial liver tumors. The resulting offset distance between the tumor center and the intrahepatic endovascular EM reference was calculated. Subsequently, EM tracked ablation probes were inserted percutaneously and navigated toward the tumor center, relying on continuous EM guidance via the intrahepatic reference. Targeting accuracy was assessed as the Euclidean distance between the tip of the ablation probe and the tumor center (Target Positioning Error, TPE). Procedural efficiency was assessed as time efforts for tumor referencing and tumor targeting.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In 6 animals, 124 targeting measurements were performed with an offset distance &amp;lt; 30 mm (clinically most feasible position), resulting in a mean TPE of 2.9 ± 1.6 mm. No significant correlation between the TPE and different intrahepatic offset distances (range 21 to 61 mm, n = 365) was shown as long as the EM reference was placed within the liver. However, the mean TPE increased when placing the EM reference externally on the animal skin (p &amp;lt; 0.01). TPE was similar when targeting under continuous ventilation or in apnea (p = 0.50). Mean time for tumor referencing and navigated targeting was 6.5 ± 3.8 minutes and 14 ± 8 seconds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The proposed technique allows precise and efficient navigated positioning of ablation probes into liver tumors in the animal model.

As global political preeminence gradually shifted from the United Kingdom to the United States, so did the capacity to culturally influence the rest of the world. In this work, we analyze how the world-wide varieties of written English are evolving. We study both the spatial and temporal variations of vocabulary and spelling of English using a large corpus of geolocated tweets and the Google Books datasets corresponding to books published in the US and the UK. The advantage of our approach is that we can address both standard written language (Google Books) and the more colloquial forms of microblogging messages (Twitter). We find that American English is the dominant form of English outside the UK and that its influence is felt even within the UK borders. Finally, we analyze how this trend has evolved over time and the impact that some cultural events have had in shaping it.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197741</originId><fingerprint>c02dde8d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197741</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Gonçalves, Lucía Loureiro-Porto, José J.

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. The long-lasting desynchronizing impact of CR stimulation has been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. However, as yet it is unclear how to optimally choose the CR stimulation frequency, i.e. the repetition rate at which the CR stimuli are delivered. This work presents the first computational study on the dependence of the acute and long-term outcome on the CR stimulation frequency in neuronal networks with STDP. For this purpose, CR stimulation was applied with Rapidly Varying Sequences (RVS) as well as with Slowly Varying Sequences (SVS) in a wide range of stimulation frequencies and intensities. Our findings demonstrate that acute desynchronization, achieved during stimulation, does not necessarily lead to long-term desynchronization after cessation of stimulation. By comparing the long-term effects of the two different CR protocols, the RVS CR stimulation turned out to be more robust against variations of the stimulation frequency. However, SVS CR stimulation can obtain stronger anti-kindling effects. We revealed specific parameter ranges that are favorable for long-term desynchronization. For instance, RVS CR stimulation at weak intensities and with stimulation frequencies in the range of the neuronal firing rates turned out to be effective and robust, in particular, if no closed loop adaptation of stimulation parameters is (technically) available. From a clinical standpoint, this may be relevant in the context of both invasive as well as non-invasive CR stimulation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rx9Yjw7JXhk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006113</link><crawled>1525975049460</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006113</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006113</originId><fingerprint>4ae91fb0</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rx9Yjw7JXhk/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thanos Manos, Magteld Zeitler, Peter A.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to generate an ultrasonic nanobubble (NB)-mediated purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)/fludarabine suicide gene system for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;NBs were prepared from a mixture the phospholipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DPPA), perfluoropropane gas and other materials using the high shear dispersion method. NBs treated with ultrasound irradiation functioned as a gene-transfer system, and a self-constructed suicide gene expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP, treated with fludarabine functioned as a therapeutic gene. This system was used to determine the cytotoxic effects of PNP/fludarabine on HepG2 cells and SMMC7721 cells.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1. NBs with a small diameter (208–416 nm) and at a high concentration and fine homogeneity were prepared under the optimal method. 2. The pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP plasmid was efficiently transfected into HCC cells using ultrasonic NBs. 3. At 0.75μg/ml fludarabine, PNP/fludarabine showed marked cytotoxic effects toward HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. PNP/fludarabine achieved the same effect against both SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells but at a lower concentration of fludarabine for the latter. 4. Bystander effects: a 10–20% decrease in the cell survival rate was observed when only 5–10% of transfected cells were PNP positive.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;NBs constitute a non-toxic, stable and effective gene-delivery platform. The PNP/fludarabine suicide gene system inhibited the growth of HCC cells, induced HCC cell apoptosis, and caused a notable bystander effect at a low fludarabine concentration. This study establishes an important new method for miniaturizing microbubbles and improving a new NB-mediated approach for gene therapy of HCC.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</originId><fingerprint>849a7e78</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Zhang, Mingna Chen, Youming Zhang, Wei Chen, Lihua Zhang, Lv Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Sarcopenic obesity is a risk factor of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to generate a predictive score of sarcopenia occurrence one year after bariatric surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Patients and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted an observational prospective cohort study on a total of 184 severely obese patients admitted to our institution to undergo sleeve gastrectomy. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebrae (SMA, cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was measured from the routinely performed computed tomography. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as follows: SMA/height&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI &amp;lt; 38.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for women and &amp;lt; 52.4 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for men. Measurements were performed at surgery and one year later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Most of the included patients were female (79%), with a mean age of 42±0.9 years and body mass index of 43.2±0.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Fifteen patients (8%) had sarcopenia before surgery and 59 (32%) at the one-year follow-up. Male gender (p&amp;lt;0.0001), SMA before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001), and SMI before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001) significantly correlated with the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after surgery by multivariate analysis. Two predictive sarcopenia occurrence scores were constructed using SMA and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt;) or SMI and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt;).

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Sarcopenic obesity is a risk factor of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to generate a predictive score of sarcopenia occurrence one year after bariatric surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Patients and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted an observational prospective cohort study on a total of 184 severely obese patients admitted to our institution to undergo sleeve gastrectomy. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebrae (SMA, cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was measured from the routinely performed computed tomography. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as follows: SMA/height&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI &amp;lt; 38.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for women and &amp;lt; 52.4 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for men. Measurements were performed at surgery and one year later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Most of the included patients were female (79%), with a mean age of 42±0.9 years and body mass index of 43.2±0.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Fifteen patients (8%) had sarcopenia before surgery and 59 (32%) at the one-year follow-up. Male gender (p&amp;lt;0.0001), SMA before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001), and SMI before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001) significantly correlated with the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after surgery by multivariate analysis. Two predictive sarcopenia occurrence scores were constructed using SMA and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt;) or SMI and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt;). The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; was significantly greater than that of the &lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt; for the diagnosis of postoperative sarcopenia occurrence (0.95±0.02 &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 0.90±0.02; p&amp;lt;0.01). A cut-off value for the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; of 0.53 had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 95%. In the group of patients without baseline sarcopenia, the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; had still an excellent AUROC of 0.92±0.02. A cut-off of 0.55 predicted development of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy in these patients with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 88%, and negative predictive value of 95%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; has excellent predictive value for the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy. This score can be used to target early intensification of nutritional and dietetic follow-up to the predicted high-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Predictive score of sarcopenia occurrence one year after bariatric surgery in severely obese patients</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526331600000</updated></item><item><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16330319512:1bd0476:93d646dc</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315317v1?rss=1</link><author><name>McClure-Begley, T.

One of the most ambitious endeavors in the field of diabetes technology is non-invasive glucose sensing. In the past decades, a number of different technologies have been assessed, but none of these have found its entry into general clinical use. We report on the development of a table-top confocal Raman spectrometer that was used in the home of patients with diabetes and operated for extended periods of time unsupervised and without recalibration. The system is based on measurement of glucose levels at a ‘critical depth’ in the skin, specifically in the interstitial fluid located below the stratum corneum but above the underlying adipose tissue layer. The region chosen for routine glucose measurements was the base of the thumb (the thenar). In a small clinical study, 35 patients with diabetes analyzed their interstitial fluid glucose for a period of 60 days using the new critical-depth Raman (CD-Raman) method and levels were correlated to reference capillary blood glucose values using a standard finger-stick and test strip product. The calibration of the CD-Raman system was stable for &gt; 10 days. Measurement performance for glucose levels present at, or below, a depth of ~250μm below the skin surface was comparable to that reported for currently available invasive continuous glucose monitors. In summary, using the CD-Raman technology we have demonstrated the first successful use of a non-invasive glucose monitor in the home.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197134</originId><fingerprint>da6a5b19</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197134</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Signe M.

Determining such ensembles is difficult because many measurements that capture multiple conformational populations provide only sparse data. A powerful opportunity exists to leverage molecular simulations to select which experiments will yield most efficient refinement. We have developed an information-theoretic approach to guide experiments by ranking which measurements will best refine the underlying conformational ensemble. We have prospectively tested this approach on the Neisserial virulence-associated protein Opa60, identifying maximally informative residue pairs, measuring distance distributions using DEER spectroscopy, and assessing how well these data refine the Opa60 conformational ensemble. Our simulation-guided approach significantly outperforms standard residue-pair selection, providing a systematic method for iterative experiment selection and incorporation. It further yields structural insight into how Opa60 engages cellular receptors while maintaining overall conformational flexibility.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319335v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>b3f8e4ea</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319335v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Highly flexible proteins present a special challenge for structure determination because they are multi-structured yet not disordered, and the resulting conformational ensembles are essential for understanding their function.

We have prospectively tested this approach on the Neisserial virulence-associated protein Opa60, identifying maximally informative residue pairs, measuring distance distributions using DEER spectroscopy, and assessing how well these data refine the Opa60 conformational ensemble. Our simulation-guided approach significantly outperforms standard residue-pair selection, providing a systematic method for iterative experiment selection and incorporation. It further yields structural insight into how Opa60 engages cellular receptors while maintaining overall conformational flexibility.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Refinement of highly flexible protein structures using simulation-guided spectroscopy [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16341385bca:5412fd:93d646dc</id><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4845.short?rss=1</link><author><name>Bo Xiang, Raphael F.

TF knockdown experiments have revealed correlations between TF binding profiles and gene expression levels. We present a general framework capable of predicting genes with similar tissue-wide expression patterns from activated or repressed TF targets using machine learning to combine TF binding and epigenetic features. Methods: Genes with correlated expression patterns across 53 tissues were identified according to their Bray-Curtis similarity. DNase I-accessible promoter intervals of direct TF target genes were scanned with previously derived information theory-based position weight matrices (iPWMs) of 82 TFs. Features from information density-based TFBS clusters were used to predict target genes with machine learning classifiers. The accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the classifiers were determined for different feature sets. Mutations in TFBSs were also introduced to in silico examine their impact on cluster densities and the regulatory states of target genes. Results: We initially chose the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1), whose regulation has been extensively studied, to test this approach. SLC25A32 and TANK were found to exhibit the most similar expression patterns to this gene across 53 tissues. A Decision Tree classifier exhibited the largest area (0.9987 and 0.9956 respectively before and after eliminating inaccessible promoter intervals based on DNase I HyperSensitive Regions (DHSs)) under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve in detecting such coordinately regulated genes. Target gene prediction was confirmed using siRNA knockdown data of TFs, which was more accurate than CRISPR inactivation. In-silico mutation analyses of TFBSs also revealed that one or more information-dense TFBS clusters in promoters are required for accurate target gene prediction. Conclusions: Machine learning based on TFBS information density, organization, and chromatin accessibility accurately identifies gene targets with comparable tissue-wide expression patterns. Multiple, information-dense TFBS clusters in promoters appear to protect promoters from the effects of deleterious binding site mutations in a single TFBS that would effectively alter the expression state of these genes.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283267v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>d8bd3590</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283267v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Background: The distribution and composition of cis-regulatory modules (e.g. transcription factor binding site (TFBS) clusters) in promoters substantially determine gene expression patterns and TF targets, whose expression levels are significantly regulated by TF binding.

Structural comparisons with other TRP channels give novel insights into the general architecture and domain organization of this superfamily of channels and help to understand their function and pharmacology.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1630b2b1723:100d5e6:fc1f8953</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019371?af=R</link><author><name>Kanav Setia</name></author><published>1524635335000</published><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1524900763427</crawled><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019371?af=R</originId><fingerprint>c7252096</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019371?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Bravyi-Kitaev Superfast simulation of electronic structure on a quantum computer</title><unread>True</unread><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163a74b2a75:184a155:2835af05</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05276-w</link><author><name>NA</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05276-w</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527490800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drilling reveals the Great Barrier Reef’s restless past&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drilling reveals the Great Barrier Reef’s restless past, Published online: 28 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05276-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05276-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The world’s largest coral reef is a resilient nomad.</description><crawled>1527520111221</crawled><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05276-w/d41586-018-05276-w_15789452.jpg</url><width>1024</width><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><fingerprint>ca709851</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05276-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drilling reveals the Great Barrier Reef’s restless past&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drilling reveals the Great Barrier Reef’s restless past, Published online: 28 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05276-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05276-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The world’s largest coral reef is a resilient nomad.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Drilling reveals the Great Barrier Reef’s restless past</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395c0:3dd877af</id><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/748-g?rss=1</link><author><name>Kiberstis, P.

Potential confounders (e.g. age, ischemia time, MELD score) were comparable. One-year patient and graft survival were similar. Frequencies of rejections, primary-non function or re-transplantation were not different.

Intermittent water supplies (IWS) deliver piped water to one billion people; this water is often microbially contaminated. Contaminants that accumulate while IWS are depressurized are flushed into customers’ homes when these systems become pressurized. In addition, during the steady-state phase of IWS, contaminants from higher-pressure sources (e.g., sewers) may continue to intrude where pipe pressure is low. To guide the operation and improvement of IWS, this paper proposes an analytic model relating supply pressure, supply duration, leakage, and the volume of intruded, potentially-contaminated, fluids present during flushing and steady-state. The proposed model suggests that increasing the supply duration may improve water quality during the flushing phase, but decrease the subsequent steady-state water quality. As such, regulators and academics should take more care in reporting if water quality samples are taken during flushing or steady-state operational conditions. Pipe leakage increases with increased supply pressure and/or duration. We propose using an equivalent orifice area (EOA) to quantify pipe quality. This provides a more stable metric for regulators and utilities tracking pipe repairs. Finally, we show that the volume of intruded fluid decreases in proportion to reductions in EOA. The proposed relationships are applied to self-reported performance indicators for IWS serving 108 million people described in the IBNET database and in the Benchmarking and Data Book of Water Utilities in India. This application shows that current high-pressure, continuous water supply targets will require extensive EOA reductions. For example, in order to achieve national targets, utilities in India will need to reduce their EOA by a median of at least 90%.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196887</originId><fingerprint>e8c43234</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196887</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by David D.

Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß.

The leukocyte chemosensory pathway detects attractant gradients and directs cell migration to sites of inflammation, infection, tissue damage, and carcinogenesis. Previous studies have revealed that local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signals at the leading edge of polarized leukocytes play central roles in positive feedback loop essential to cell polarization and chemotaxis. These prior studies showed that stimulation of the leading edge Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal can strongly activate PI3K, thereby triggering a larger PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signal, but did not elucidate the mechanistic link between Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signaling. A hypothesis explaining this link emerged, postulating that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated PKC displaces the MARCKS protein from plasma membrane PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby releasing sequestered PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to serve as the target and substrate lipid of PI3K in PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; single molecule studies of the reconstituted pathway on lipid bilayers demonstrated the feasibility of this PKC-MARCKS-PI3K regulatory module linking Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signals in the reconstituted system. The present study tests the model predictions in live macrophages by quantifying the effects of: (a) two pathway activators—PDGF and ATP that stimulate chemoreceptors and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, respectively; and (b) three pathway inhibitors—wortmannin, EGTA, and Go6976 that inhibit PI3K, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, and PKC, respectively; on (c) four leading edge activity sensors—AKT-PH-mRFP, CKAR, MARCKSp-mRFP, and leading edge area that report on PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; density, PKC activity, MARCKS membrane binding, and leading edge expansion/contraction, respectively. The results provide additional evidence that PKC and PI3K are both essential elements of the leading edge positive feedback loop, and strongly support the existence of a PKC-MARCKS-PI3K regulatory module linking the leading edge Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signals. As predicted, activators stimulate leading edge PKC activity, displacement of MARCKS from the leading edge membrane and increased leading edge PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; levels, while inhibitors trigger the opposite effects. Comparison of the findings for the ameboid chemotaxis of leukocytes with recently published findings for the mesenchymal chemotaxis of fibroblasts suggests that some features of the emerging leukocyte leading edge core pathway (PLC-DAG-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-PKC-MARCKS-PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PI3K-PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) may well be shared by all chemotaxing eukaryotic cells, while other elements of the leukocyte pathway may be specialized features of these highly optimized, professional gradient-seeking cells. More broadly, the findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the strong links between phospho-MARCKS and many human cancers.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196678</originId><fingerprint>f9587645</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196678</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Brian P.

Objective &lt;p&gt;In the liver, a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH) is oxidative stress, which leads to the accumulation of highly reactive electrophilic α/β unsaturated aldehydes. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of NASH on protein carbonylation and antioxidant responses in a murine model.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Liver-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deletion mice (PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt;) or control littermates were fed a standard chow diet for 45–55 weeks followed by analysis for liver injury, oxidative stress and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Histology and Picrosirius red-staining of collagen deposition within the extracellular matrix revealed extensive steatosis and fibrosis in the PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice but no steatosis or fibrosis in controls. Increased steatosis and fibrosis corresponded with significant increases in inflammation. PTEN-deficient livers showed significantly increased cell-specific oxidative damage, as detected by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and acrolein staining. Elevated staining correlated with an increase in nuclear DNA repair foci (γH2A.X) and cellular proliferation index (Ki67) within zones 1 and 3, indicating oxidative damage was zonally restricted and was associated with increased DNA damage and cell proliferation. Immunoblots showed that total levels of antioxidant response proteins induced by nuclear factor erythroid-2-like-2 (Nrf2), including GSTμ, GSTπ and CBR1/3, but not HO-1, were elevated in PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; as compared to controls, and IHC showed this response also occurred only in zones 1 and 3. Furthermore, an analysis of autophagy markers revealed significant elevation of p62 and LC3II expression. Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis identified significantly more carbonylated proteins in whole cell extracts prepared from PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice (966) as compared to controls (809). Pathway analyses of identified proteins did not uncover specific pathways that were preferentially carbonylated in PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; livers but, did reveal specific strongly increased carbonylation of thioredoxin reductase and of glutathione-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-transferases (GST) M6, O1, and O2.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Results show that disruption of PTEN resulted in steatohepatitis, fibrosis and caused hepatic induction of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant system at least in part due to elevation of p62. This response was both cell-type and zone specific. However, these responses were insufficient to mitigate the accumulation of products of lipid peroxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198139</originId><fingerprint>587ec5e7</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198139</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dennis R.

However, these responses were insufficient to mitigate the accumulation of products of lipid peroxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Elevated Nrf-2 responses are insufficient to mitigate protein carbonylation in hepatospecific PTEN deletion mice</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1527282000000</updated></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163833f9bde:6664dd9:93d646dc</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0143-x</link><author><name>Ken-ichi Uchida</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0143-x</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><engagement>25</engagement><published>1526886000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation of anisotropic magneto-Peltier effect in nickel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observation of anisotropic magneto-Peltier effect in nickel, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0143-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0143-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A ‘magneto-Peltier effect’ produces cooling or heating in a material without junctions, by forcing a change in angle between the current and magnetization in a single ferromagnetic nickel slab.</description><crawled>1526915374046</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-018-0143-x/MediaObjects/41586_2018_143_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><height>185</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><fingerprint>64e33e1</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0143-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation of anisotropic magneto-Peltier effect in nickel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observation of anisotropic magneto-Peltier effect in nickel, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0143-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0143-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A ‘magneto-Peltier effect’ produces cooling or heating in a material without junctions, by forcing a change in angle between the current and magnetization in a single ferromagnetic nickel slab.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Observation of anisotropic magneto-Peltier effect in nickel</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1636a9ab268:44c7f9d:2835af05</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323899v1?rss=1</link><author><name>Parmar, J.

Accordingly there are many diseases that result directly from either lack or excess of iron. Iron has also been associated with a wide range of other diseases and may have an important role in aging. Yet many molecular and physiological aspects of iron regulation have only been discovered recently and others are still awaiting elucidation. In the last 18 years, after the discovery of the hormone hepcidin, many details of iron regulation have become better understood and a clearer picture is starting to emerge, at least in qualitative terms.

To adequately fit the ferrokinetic data required including the following mechanisms: a) the role of transferrin in deliving iron to tissues, b) the induction of hepcidin by high levels of transferrin-bound iron, c) the ferroportin-dependent hepcidin-regulated iron export from tissues, d) the erythropoietin regulation of erythropoiesis, and e) direct NTBI uptake by the liver. The utility of such a model to simulate disease interventions was demonstrated by using it to investigate the outcome of different schedules of transferrin treatment in {beta}-thalassemia.

This study investigated &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; expression in the &lt;i&gt;pars tuberalis&lt;/i&gt; (PT) of the pituitary and medio-basal hypothalamus (MBH) of sheep, across seasons and reproductive states. It has recently been proposed that season impacts alternative splicing of &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in the PT, which shifts the balance between angiogenic VEGFAxxx and anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms (with xxx the number of amino acids of the mature VEGFA proteins) to modulate seasonal breeding. Here, we used various RT-PCR methodologies and analysis of RNAseq datasets to investigate seasonal variation in expression and splicing of the ovine &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; gene. Collectively, we identify 5 different transcripts for &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; within the ewe PT/MBH, which correspond to splicing events previously described in mouse and human. All identified transcripts encode angiogenic VEGFAxxx isoforms, with no evidence for alternative splicing within exon 8. These findings led us to investigate in detail how “&lt;i&gt;Vegfaxxxb&lt;/i&gt;-like” PCR products could be generated by RT-PCR and misidentified as endogenous transcripts, in sheep and human HEK293 cells. In conclusion, our findings do not support the existence of anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms in the ovine PT/MBH and shed new light on the interpretation of prior studies, which claimed to identify &lt;i&gt;Vegfaxxxb&lt;/i&gt; isoforms by RT-PCR.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197123</originId><fingerprint>7ab7b568</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197123</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Didier Lomet, Benoît Piégu, Shona H.

Surveys of restored oyster reefs need to produce accurate population estimates to assess the efficacy of restoration. Due to the complex structure of subtidal oyster reefs, one effective and efficient means to sample is by patent tongs, rather than SCUBA, dredges, or bottom cores. Restored reefs vary in relief and oyster density, either of which could affect survey efficiency. This study is the first to evaluate gear (the first full grab) and survey (which includes selecting a specific half portion of the first grab for further processing) efficiencies of hand-operated patent tongs as a function of reef height and oyster density on subtidal restoration reefs. In the Great Wicomico River, a tributary of lower Chesapeake Bay, restored reefs of high- and low-relief (25–45 cm, and 8–12 cm, respectively) were constructed throughout the river as the first large-scale oyster sanctuary reef restoration effort (sanctuary acreage &gt; 20 ha at one site) in Chesapeake Bay. We designed a metal frame to guide a non-hydraulic mechanical patent tong repeatedly into the same plot on a restored reef until all oysters within the grab area were captured. Full capture was verified by an underwater remotely-operated vehicle. Samples (n = 19) were taken on nine different reefs, including five low- (n = 8) and four high-relief reefs (n = 11), over a two-year period. The gear efficiency of the patent tong was estimated to be 76% (± 5% standard error), whereas survey efficiency increased to 81% (± 10%) due to processing. Neither efficiency differed significantly between young-of-the-year oysters (spat) and adults, high- and low-relief reefs, or years. As this type of patent tong is a common and cost-effective tool to evaluate oyster restoration projects as well as population density on fished habitat, knowing the gear and survey efficiencies allows for accurate and precise population estimates.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196725</originId><fingerprint>c959b6b1</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196725</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by David M.

As this type of patent tong is a common and cost-effective tool to evaluate oyster restoration projects as well as population density on fished habitat, knowing the gear and survey efficiencies allows for accurate and precise population estimates.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Gear and survey efficiency of patent tongs for oyster populations on restoration reefs</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525294800000</updated></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4f1:3dd877af</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198235</link><author><name>Michaela Mallow</name></author><published>1527195600000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198235</canonicalUrl><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michaela Mallow, Lee Gary, Timmy Jeng, Bob Bongomin Jr, Miriam Tamar Aschkenasy, Peter Wallis, Hilarie H.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was the largest in history. Starting in September 2014, International Medical Corps (IMC) operated five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) in Sierra Leone and Liberia. This paper explores how future infectious disease outbreak facilities in resource-limited settings can be planned, organized, and managed by analyzing data collected on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and infection prevention control (IPC) protocols.&lt;/p&gt; Design/Methodology/Approach &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study by analyzing WASH/IPC activity data routinely recorded on paper forms or white boards at ETUs during the outbreak and later merged into a database from two IMC-run ETUs in Sierra Leone between December 2014 and December 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The IMC WASH/IPC database contains data from over 369 days. Our results highlight parameters key to designing and maintaining an ETU. High concentration chlorine solution usage was highly correlated with both daily patient occupancy and high-risk zone staff entries; low concentration chlorine usage was less well explained by these measures. There is high demand for laundering and disinfecting of personal protective equipment (PPE) on a daily basis and approximately 1 (0–4) piece of PPE is damaged each day.&lt;/p&gt; Research limitations/Implications &lt;p&gt;Lack of standardization in the type and format of data collected at ETUs made constructing the WASH/IPC database difficult. However, the data presented here may help inform humanitarian response operations in future epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198235</originId><fingerprint>24439f27</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198235</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michaela Mallow, Lee Gary, Timmy Jeng, Bob Bongomin Jr, Miriam Tamar Aschkenasy, Peter Wallis, Hilarie H.

We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining lipid homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate lipid mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-fat diet in mice or hepatic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-nitrosylation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity.

We generated a large toxicogenomics resource comprising ~6,000 expression profiles corresponding to 330 chemicals profiled in HepG2 cells at multiple doses and in replicates. Predictive models of carcinogenicity were built using a Random Forest classifier. Differential pathway enrichment analysis was performed to identify pathways associated with carcinogen exposure. Signatures of carcinogenicity and genotoxicity were compared with external data sources including Drugmatrix and the Connectivity Map. Among profiles with sufficient bioactivity, our classifiers achieved 72.2% AUC for predicting carcinogenicity and 82.3% AUC for predicting genotoxicity. Our analysis showed that chemical bioactivity, as measured by the strength and reproducibility of the transcriptional response, is not significantly associated with long-term carcinogenicity, as evidenced by the many carcinogenic chemicals that did not elicit substantial changes in gene expression at doses up to 40 uM. However, sufficiently high transcriptional bioactivity is necessary for a chemical to be used for prediction of carcinogenicity. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed several pathways consistent with literature review of pathways that drive cancer, including DNA damage and DNA repair.

However, computational identification of lncRNAs in a wide range of species remains challenging; it requires prior knowledge of well-established sequences and annotations or species-specific training data, but the reality is that only a limited number of species have high-quality sequences and annotations. Here we first characterize lncRNAs by contrast to protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship and find that the feature relationship between ORF (open reading frame) length and GC content presents universally substantial divergence in lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs, as observed in a broad variety of species. Based on the feature relationship, accordingly, we further present LGC, a novel algorithm for identifying lncRNAs that is able to accurately distinguish lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs in a cross-species manner without any prior knowledge. As validated on large-scale empirical datasets, comparative results show that LGC outperforms existing algorithms by achieving higher accuracy, well-balanced sensitivity and specificity, and is robustly effective (&gt;90% accuracy) in discriminating lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs across diverse species that range from plants to mammals. To our knowledge, this study, for the first time, differentially characterizes lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship, which is further applied in computational identification of lncRNAs. Taken together, our study represents a significant advance in characterization and identification of lncRNAs and LGC thus bears broad potential utility for computational analysis of lncRNAs in a wide range of species.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327882v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>1db04f06</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327882v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>The significance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in many biological processes and diseases has gained intense interests over the past several years.

Many tumors are characterized by genetic instability, producing an assortment of genetic variants of tumor cells called subclones. These tumors and their surrounding environments form complex multi-cellular ecosystems, where subclones compete for resources and cooperate to perform multiple tasks, including cancer invasion. Our recent empirical studies revealed existence of such distinct phenotypes of cancer cells, leaders and followers, in lung cancer. These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. This class can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast these manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZu0gxkmVxM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006131</link><crawled>1527184669816</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006131</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006131</originId><fingerprint>9b9b4055</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/cZu0gxkmVxM/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seth Haney, Jessica Konen, Adam I.

In this study, we examine the impact of socioeconomic situations of children’s families during their early childhood on the children’s social adaptation in Japanese elementary school.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The current investigation consisted of two sets of data relating to two separate years (with a one-year interval). The participants included preschoolers aged five years at Time 1 (the first year) and first graders aged six years at Time 2 (the second year); 1,712 met the inclusion criteria for both years. Parents of the participants completed a self-reported questionnaire regarding their SES (i.e., family economy and mother’s education) and their children’s mental health. Mental health was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist/4–18, Parent Report.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For each SES indicator, we found an inverse relationship across all the symptom dimensions. Specifically, bivariate analyses revealed that lower family income, maternal education level, and paternal education level predict all three domains of behavioral problems (i.e., internalized problems, externalized problems, and total behavioral problems). Further, multivariate analyses revealed that lower family income consistently predicts all domains of behavioral problems, lower maternal education level predicted externalized problems and total behavioral problems, and paternal education level did not predict any clinically significant behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In this sample, we found that, for children, family income and parental education when entering preschool were significant predictors of mental health problems after elementary school enrollment; in particular, low income and low maternal educational achievement predicted a high probability of the development of a psychiatric disorder.

For the last 100 years, it has been uncontroversial to state that the plant germline is set aside late in development, but there is surprisingly little evidence to support this view. In contrast, much evolutionary theory and several recent empirical studies seem to suggest the opposite—that the germlines of some and perhaps most plants may be set aside early in development. But is this really the case? How much does it matter? How can we reconcile the new evidence with existing knowledge of plant development? And is there a way to reliably establish the timing of germline segregation in both model and nonmodel plants? Answering these questions is vital to understanding one of the most fundamental aspects of plant development and evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0LiCyHbkEf4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005439</link><crawled>1526493856788</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005439</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005439</originId><fingerprint>1cb6484f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/0LiCyHbkEf4/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Lanfear&lt;/p&gt;

The Tasmanian devil (&lt;i&gt;Sarcophilus harrisii)&lt;/i&gt;, the largest extant carnivorous marsupial and endemic to Tasmania, is at the verge of extinction due to the emergence of a transmissible cancer known as devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). DFTD has spread over the distribution range of the species and has been responsible for a severe decline in the global devil population. To protect the Tasmanian devil from extinction in the wild, our group has focused on the development of a prophylactic vaccine. Although this work has shown that vaccine preparations using whole DFTD tumour cells supplemented with adjuvants can induce anti-DFTD immune responses, alternative strategies that induce stronger and more specific immune responses are required. In humans, heat shock proteins (HSPs) derived from tumour cells have been used instead of whole-tumour cell preparations as a source of antigens for cancer immunotherapy. As HSPs have not been studied in the Tasmanian devil, this study presents the first characterisation of HSPs in this marsupial and evaluates the suitability of these proteins as antigenic components for the enhancement of a DFTD vaccine. We show that tissues and cancer cells from the Tasmanian devil express constitutive and inducible HSP. Additionally, this study suggests that HSP derived from DFTD cancer cells are immunogenic supporting the future development of a HSP-based vaccine against DFTD.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196469</originId><fingerprint>7b279864</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196469</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cesar Tovar, Amanda L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Increased hepatic insulin clearance (HIC) is important in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study is to analyze an effective insulin resistance (IR) index that is minimally affected by HIC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Our study involved 20 participants with T2DM and 21 healthy participants without diabetes (Non-DM). Participants underwent a meal tolerance test from which plasma glucose, insulin and serum C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) were measured, and HOMA-IR and HIC were calculated. Participants then underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp from which the glucose disposal rate (GDR) was measured.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The index CPR-IR = 20/(fasting CPR × fasting plasma glucose) was correlated more strongly with GDR, than was HOMA-IR, and CPR-IR could be used to estimate GDR.

In Non-DM, CPR-IR and HOMA-IR were equally well correlated with GDR regardless of HIC.

Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease, with considerable genetic contribution. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified a number of genomic regions for the risk of psoriasis. However, it is challenging to pinpoint the functional causal variants and then further decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying each region. In order to prioritize potential functional causal variants within psoriasis susceptibility regions, we integrated the genetic association findings and functional genomic data publicly available, i.e. histone modifications in relevant immune cells. We characterized a pervasive enrichment pattern of psoriasis variants in five core histone marks across immune cells/tissues. We discovered that genetic alleles within psoriasis association regions might influence gene expression levels through significantly affecting the binding affinities of 17 transcription factors. We established a catalog of 654 potential functional causal variants for psoriasis and suggested that they significantly overlapped with causal variants for autoimmune diseases. We identified potential causal variant rs79824801 overlay with the peaks of five histone marks in primary CD4+ T cells. Its alternative allele affected the binding affinity of transcription factor &lt;i&gt;IKZF1&lt;/i&gt;. This study highlights the complex genetic architecture and complicated mechanisms for psoriasis. The findings will inform the functional experiment design for psoriasis.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196635</originId><fingerprint>a06cfa57</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196635</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yan Lin, Lu Liu, Yujun Sheng, Changbing Shen, Xiaodong Zheng, Fusheng Zhou, Sen Yang, Xianyong Yin, Xuejun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

People who have been advocating this for years will now get a chance to see how it works out in practice – and in fact, I would encourage them to go ahead and put down some predictions about what they think might happen. Predicting that not much will change, or that it will be hard to notice the effects, etc., is not (to my mind) a particularly good answer for supporters of this approach, because one then wonders why it was worth going to the trouble at all. But I’m not a supporter, so that’s my prediction: little change, with potential for harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/06/10/right_to_try_here_we_go&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/06/20/stem_cells_the_center_of_right_to_try&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt; many times before, but in case my views aren’t clear, here we go: I think Right to Try laws are largely useless, and have the potential to cause actual harm disproportionate to the good they might do. I think that there are sincere, principled advocates for them, but at the same time, there are many people on that side of the issue who are either ill-informed about medical research or who are simply grandstanding for votes and popular support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, my biggest reasons for thinking this way are: (1) most investigational drugs don’t work. The failure rate in human clinical trials is around 90 per cent, and it’s been that way for a long time. (2) there are disease areas where a tragedy-of-the-commons situation will mean that controlled clinical trials (which are still the only way to determine if a new drug works) will be much more difficult to run under a “why wait for proof?” system (I have to note that the current bill restricts right-to-try to those patients who are ineligible for clinical trials, which is a good provision). (3) opening up unproven therapies could lead to a moral hazard, where it becomes lucrative to put useless-but-harmless “drug candidates” into “clinical trials” so you can charge desperate patients at “cost”. I mean every quotation mark in that last sentence. I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-05-24/right-to-try-drug-law-risks-exploiting-desperate-patients&quot;&gt;not the only person&lt;/a&gt; who thinks this way. My own suggestion for the last point has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dereklowe/status/826761000032600064&quot;&gt;already been made&lt;/a&gt;: antioxidant phytonutrients – i.e., dried grape juice pills – for Alzheimer’s. Won’t do a thing, but hey, you have the right to try ’em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/372440-hundreds-sign-on-to-letter-opposing-right-to-try-drug-bill&quot;&gt;empirical evidence&lt;/a&gt; for all of these positions. Many states have passed their own right-to-try laws (in various forms), and if there has been any decrease in human suffering or advance in medical knowledge through them, I have missed it. To get specific, when Colorado passed its own law in 2014, one of the first companies that announced plans to offer treatments under its provisions was a stem-cell company, Neuralstem. And guess what? None of their treatments &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4094360-neuralstem-doomed&quot;&gt;ever worked&lt;/a&gt;. Most things don’t. (As an earlier link shows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, I’m inclined to put this current legislation in the “grandstanding” category. That’s because, as I understand it, there are no provisions that any given company has to provide such an experimental drug for use. It might be better named “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/right-to-try-bill-passes-trump-to-sign-will-it-help-terminally-ill-patients/&quot;&gt;right to ask&lt;/a&gt;“, and the compassionate-use program already provides just that. What’s changed? Well, now that we have a brand new federal law, all sorts of politicians will be able to talk about how they brought lifesaving therapies directly to critically ill patients, shook up the horrible drug approval process, struck a blow for the common people and stuck it to the drug companies, and on and on. Not always a very instructive spectacle, politics. Scott Gottlieb &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/05/24/614105544/right-to-try-act-poses-big-challenge-for-fda&quot;&gt;now gets to implement&lt;/a&gt; this law, and good luck to him.&lt;/p&gt;

Furthermore, we show the existence of high water permeability sites in the Turing structures, where water transport through the membranes is enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><keywords><item>Chemistry, Materials Science</item></keywords><title>Polyamide membranes with nanoscale Turing structures for water purification</title><unread>True</unread><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1634b2fd2d5:1526271:3dd877af</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6</link><author><name>NA</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><engagement>51</engagement><published>1525935600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05137-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Microbes weaken host’s immune response by triggering pain neurons.</description><crawled>1525974815445</crawled><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05137-6/d41586-018-05137-6_15749214.jpg</url><width>1024</width><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><fingerprint>9c388810</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05137-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Microbes weaken host’s immune response by triggering pain neurons.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><engagementRate>0.3</engagementRate><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce960:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/856?rss=1</originId><author><name>Gibson, P.

Among these methods, Hi-C plays a key role. Here, we present GITAR (Genome Interaction Tools and Resources), a software to perform a comprehensive Hi-C data analysis, including data preprocessing, normalization, visualization and topologically associated domains (TADs) analysis. GITAR is composed of two main modules: 1) HiCtool, a Python library to process and visualize Hi-C data, including TADs analysis and 2) Processed data library, a large collection of human and mouse datasets processed using HiCtool. HiCtool leads the user step-by-step through a pipeline which goes from the raw Hi-C data to the computation, visualization and optimized storage of intra-chromosomal contact matrices and topological domain coordinates. A large collection of standardized processed data allows to compare different datasets in a consistent way and it saves time of work to obtain data for visualization or additional analyses. GITAR enables users without any programming or bioinformatic expertise to work with Hi-C data and it is freely available for the public at http://genomegitar.org as an open source software.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259515v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>8a0ba080</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259515v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Interactions between chromatin segments play a large role in functional genomic assays and developments in genomic interaction detection methods have shown interacting topological domains within the genome.

Ramie (&lt;i&gt;Boehmeria nivea&lt;/i&gt; L. Gaud) fiber, one of the most important natural fibers, is extracted from stem bark. Continuous cropping is the main obstacle to ramie stem growth and a major cause of reduced yields. Root-associated microbes play crucial roles in plant growth and health. In this study, we investigated differences between microbial communities in the soil of healthy and continuously cropped ramie plants, and sought to identify potential mechanisms whereby these communities could counteract the problems posed by continuous cropping. Paired-end Illumina MiSeq analysis of 16S rRNA and ITS gene amplicons was employed to study bacterial and fungal communities. Long-term monoculture of ramie significantly decreased fiber yields and altered soil microbial communities. Our findings revealed how microbial communities and functional diversity varied according to the planting year and plant health status. Soil bacterial diversity increased with the period of ramie monoculture, whereas no significant differences were observed for fungi. Sequence analyses revealed that &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acidobacteria&lt;/i&gt; were the most abundant bacterial phyla. &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; abundance decreased with the period of ramie monoculture and correlated positively with the stem length, stem diameter, and fiber yield. The &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Chloroflexi&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/i&gt; phyla exhibited a significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) negative correlation with yields during continuous cultivation. Some &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt; members showed reduced microbial diversity, which prevented continuous ramie cropping. &lt;i&gt;Ascomycota&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Basidiomycota&lt;/i&gt; were the main fungal phyla. The relatively high abundance of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; observed in healthy ramie may contribute to disease suppression, thereby promoting ramie growth. In summary, soil weakness and increased disease in ramie plants after long-term continuous cropping can be attributed to changes in soil microbes, a reduction in beneficial microbes, and an accumulation of harmful microbes.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197095</originId><fingerprint>85b3937f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197095</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Siyuan Zhu, Yanzhou Wang, Xiaomin Xu, Touming Liu, Duanqing Wu, Xia Zheng, Shouwei Tang, Qiuzhong Dai&lt;/p&gt;

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006175</link><crawled>1526924658806</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006175</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006175</originId><fingerprint>9868ed43</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bABG40KQDFw/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Hyun Bak, Seogjoo J.

Advanced graphics capabilities have enabled the use of virtual reality as an efficient design technique. The integration of virtual reality in the design phase still faces impediment because of issues linked to the integration of CAD and virtual reality software. A set of empirical tests using the selected conversion parameters was found to yield properly represented virtual reality models. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 72.71% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 86.64%, indicating that 86.64% of the response variability can be explained by the model. The R-sq (pred) is 67.45%, which is not very high, indicating that the model should be further reduced by eliminating insignificant terms. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 73.32% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 79.49%, indicating that 79.49% of the response variability can be explained by the model. Using the optimization software MODE Frontier (Optimization, MOGA-II, 2014), four types of response surfaces for the three considered response variables were tested for the data of DOE. The parameter values obtained using the proposed experimental design methodology result in better graphics quality, and other necessary design attributes.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197673</originId><fingerprint>828ae9b1</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197673</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mustufa Haider Abidi, Abdulrahman Al-Ahmari, Ali Ahmad&lt;/p&gt;

In the 5‐step carboxylase reaction, the substrate Ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate (RuBP) first binds Rubisco and undergoes enolization before binding the second substrate, CO2. Hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex is followed by CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation. However, details of the roles and protonation states of active‐site residues, and sources of protons and water, remain highly speculative. Large‐scale computations on active‐site models provide a means to better understand this complex chemical mechanism. The computational protocol comprises a combination of hybrid semi‐empirical quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics within constrained molecular dynamics simulations, together with constrained gradient minimization calculations using density functional theory. Alternative pathways for hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex and associated active‐site protonation networks and proton and water sources were investigated. The main findings from analysis of the resulting energetics advocate major revision to existing mechanisms such that: hydration takes place anti to the CO2; both hydration and CC bond scission require early protonation of CO2 in the RuBP.CO2 complex; CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation reactions are concerted and, effectively, there is only one stable intermediate, the C3‐gemdiolate complex. Our main conclusions for interpreting enzyme kinetic results are that the gemdiolate may represent the elusive Michaelis–Menten‐like complex corresponding to the empirical Km (=Kc) with turnover to product via bond scission concerted with stereospecific protonation consistent with the observed catalytic rate. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><crawled>1526330805274</crawled><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25343?af=R</originId><fingerprint>60a40e84</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25343?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Revised mechanism of carboxylation of ribulose‐1,5‐biphosphate by rubisco from large scale quantum chemical calculations</title><unread>True</unread><summary><content>Here, we describe a computational approach for studying enzymes that catalyze complex multi‐step reactions and apply it to Ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase–oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme that fixes atmospheric carbon dioxide within photosynthesis.

Our main conclusions for interpreting enzyme kinetic results are that the gemdiolate may represent the elusive Michaelis–Menten‐like complex corresponding to the empirical Km (=Kc) with turnover to product via bond scission concerted with stereospecific protonation consistent with the observed catalytic rate. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><id>9eIPIKV4kOcW5lEUHqUkf3UaeBlngqwYuFsoLusj66Y=_1638e108b1f:752b7e9:3dd877af</id><link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301935%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8d96e50774755b743254f6f9e60414f9</link><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1527095913000</published><origin><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell Systems</title><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/24054712</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471218301935</canonicalUrl><crawled>1527096838943</crawled><description>Publication date: &lt;span&gt;23 May 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Pigeon racing is a popular sport worldwide. Pigeons are under continuous selection to improve speed, spatial orientation, and endurance during long flights. However, numerous genetic and non-genetic factors affect survivability and homing ability, making such traits difficult for breeders to control. Polymorphisms in the lactate dehydrogenase A gene (&lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt;) likely affects pigeon racing and homing abilities, due to its role in physical and mental performance. Additionally, the adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt;) has been associated with physiological and behavioral shifts that occur during avian migration. In this study, we examined the association between &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; genotypes with pigeon survivability during racing competitions. Survivability was evaluated through the estimated breeding value (EBV) of each individual’s total race distances during its athletic life. &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; was not polymorphic among our samples, while &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes were significantly associated with deviated EBV values of longer total race distance; individuals carrying the &lt;i&gt;S+&lt;/i&gt; genotype had higher EBV (i.e., greater survivability). Thus, the &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; locus might be useful for marker-assisted selection, empowering breeders and trainers to maximize pigeon quality. Moreover, data obtained from breeding will also improve our understanding of the genetic mechanism underlying navigation and flight for wild migrating bird species.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195121</originId><fingerprint>559650b6</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195121</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sherif Ramadan, Takeshi Miyake, Junichi Yamaura, Miho Inoue-Murayama&lt;/p&gt;

Adequate clinical exposure and training in cost-effective care is essential to train clinicians who are cost-conscious in any specialty.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Internal medicine trainees&apos; knowledge and confidence in using the American Society of Hematology Choosing Wisely guidelines in hemostasis, thrombosis, and non-malignant hematology</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526504400000</updated></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16360cb9953:32b4bf7:3dd877af</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25807-9</link><author><name>Darwin Elizondo-Quiroga</name></author><published>1526367600000</published><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Zika Virus in Salivary Glands of Five Different Species of Wild-Caught Mosquitoes from Mexico&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Zika Virus in Salivary Glands of Five Different Species of Wild-Caught Mosquitoes from Mexico, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25807-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25807-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Zika Virus in Salivary Glands of Five Different Species of Wild-Caught Mosquitoes from Mexico&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/rKt3DIuMsuo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1526337345875</crawled><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25807-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25807-9</originId><fingerprint>a86a7ab8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/rKt3DIuMsuo/s41598-018-25807-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Zika Virus in Salivary Glands of Five Different Species of Wild-Caught Mosquitoes from Mexico&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Zika Virus in Salivary Glands of Five Different Species of Wild-Caught Mosquitoes from Mexico, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25807-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25807-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Zika Virus in Salivary Glands of Five Different Species of Wild-Caught Mosquitoes from Mexico&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/rKt3DIuMsuo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Author Correction: Zika Virus in Salivary Glands of Five Different Species of Wild-Caught Mosquitoes from Mexico</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16373a61a23:537dd9e:2835af05</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325522v1?rss=1</link><author><name>Moshiri, N.</name></author><published>1526626800000</published><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><engagement>52</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/18/325522</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526653655587</crawled><description>Background: Phylogenetic trees are essential to evolutionary biology, and numerous methods exist that attempt to extract information applicable to a wide range of disciplines, such as epidemiology and metagenomics.

However, one challenge in accurately characterizing microbial communities is exogenous bacterial DNA contamination. This is particularly problematic for sites of low microbial biomass such as the urinary tract, placenta, and lower airway. Computational approaches have been proposed as a post-processing step to identify and remove potential contaminants, but their performance has not been independently evaluated. To identify the impact of decreasing microbial biomass on polymicrobial 16S rRNA gene sequencing experiments, we used a serial dilution of a mock microbial community. We evaluated two computational approaches to identify and remove contaminants: 1) identifying sequences that have an inverse correlation with DNA concentration implemented in Decontam and 2) predicting the proportion of experimental sample arising from defined contaminant sources implemented in SourceTracker. Results: As expected, the proportion of contaminant bacterial DNA increased with decreasing starting microbial biomass, with 79.12% of the most dilute sample arising from contaminant sequences. Inclusion of contaminant sequences in analyses leads to overinflated diversity estimates (up to 12 times greater than the expected values) and distorts microbiome composition. SourceTracker successfully removed over 98% of contaminants when the experimental environments are well defined. However, SourceTracker performed poorly when the experimental environment is unknown, failing to remove the majority of contaminants. Decontam successfully removed 74 - 91% of contaminants regardless of prior knowledge of the experimental environment. Conclusions: Our study indicates that computational methods can reduce the amount of contaminants in 16S rRNA gene sequencing experiments. The appropriate computational approach for removing contaminant sequences from an experiment depends on the prior knowledge about the microbial environment under investigation and can be evaluated with a dilution series of a mock microbial community.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329854v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>7de5d1bc</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329854v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Background: Microbial communities are commonly studied using culture-independent methods such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Hand hygiene practice in hospitals is unfortunately still widely insufficient, even though it is known that transmitting pathogens via hands is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. Previous research has shown that improving knowledge, providing feedback on past behaviour and targeting social norms are promising approaches to improve hand hygiene practices. The present field experiment was designed to direct people on when to perform hand hygiene and prevent forgetfulness. This intervention is the first to examine the effect of inducing injunctive social norms via an emoticon-based feedback system on hand hygiene behaviour. Electronic monitoring and feedback devices were installed in hospital patient rooms on top of hand-rub dispensers, next to the doorway, for a period of 17 weeks. In the emoticon condition, screens at the devices activated whenever a person entered or exited the room. Before using the alcohol-based hand-rub dispenser, a frowny face was displayed, indicating that hand hygiene should be performed. If the dispenser was subsequently used, this picture changed to a smiley face to positively reinforce the correct behaviour. Hand hygiene behaviour in the emoticon rooms significantly outperformed the behaviour in three other tested conditions. The strong effect in this field experiment indicates that activating injunctive norms may be a promising approach to improve hand hygiene behaviour. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197465</originId><fingerprint>e2c7e98f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197465</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Gaube, Dimitrios Tsivrikos, Daniel Dollinger, Eva Lermer&lt;/p&gt;

Given the limited efficacy of anticancer therapies targeting single tumor suppressor genes, we developed small circular single-stranded DNA (CSSD) that can up-regulate the expression of co-silenced tumor suppressor genes by sequestering microRNAs (miRNAs) that negatively regulate these genes. We found that cancer patients with low tumor expression of the tumor suppressor genes &lt;i&gt;KLF17&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CDH1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;LASS2&lt;/i&gt; had shortened survival times. The up-regulation of these genes upon transfection of artificial CSSD-9 inhibited tumor proliferation and metastasis and promoted apoptosis in vitro as well as in ex vivo and patient-derived xenograft models.

Given the limited efficacy of anticancer therapies targeting single tumor suppressor genes, we developed small circular single-stranded DNA (CSSD) that can up-regulate the expression of co-silenced tumor suppressor genes by sequestering microRNAs (miRNAs) that negatively regulate these genes. We found that cancer patients with low tumor expression of the tumor suppressor genes &lt;i&gt;KLF17&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CDH1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;LASS2&lt;/i&gt; had shortened survival times. The up-regulation of these genes upon transfection of artificial CSSD-9 inhibited tumor proliferation and metastasis and promoted apoptosis in vitro as well as in ex vivo and patient-derived xenograft models. In addition, CSSD is more stable and effective than current miRNA inhibitors, and transfecting CSSDs via nanoparticles substantially improved delivery efficiency. The use of a single CSSD can promote the inhibition of multiple tumor suppressor genes. This study provides evidence for the possibility of using CSSDs as therapeutic miRNA inhibitors to target the co-silencing of multiple tumor suppressor genes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>[Research Articles] Derepression of co-silenced tumor suppressor genes by nanoparticle-loaded circular ssDNA reduces tumor malignancy</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af2:5785ab88</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196943</link><author><name>Julio Barrera</name></author><published>1525381200000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196943</canonicalUrl><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julio Barrera, Shobana Subramanian, Ornit Chiba-Falek&lt;/p&gt;
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), is a transcription factor that governs pathways, such as lipid metabolism and immune response, that have been implicated in the etiology of LOAD. Previously, we established HepG2-derived cell-lines with stable knockdown of PPARγ gene, and showed an increase in mRNA levels of genes mapped in the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; linkage disequilibrium (LD) region on chromosome 19q13.32, with the greatest effect observed for &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;-mRNA. Here, we extended the analysis using our &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown model system and investigated the broader effect on expression changes of genes implicated in LOAD via genome wide association studies (GWAS). We applied the nCounter gene expression assay (NanoString) using a panel of twenty-four LOAD-associated genes inferred by proximity to the top significantly associated SNPs. Two independent &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown cell-lines showed changes in mRNA levels of a total of seven genes compared to a control HepG2 cell-line; six of which, &lt;i&gt;ABCA7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CASS4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CELF1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PTK2B&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ZCWPW1&lt;/i&gt;, were upregulated and one, &lt;i&gt;DSG2&lt;/i&gt;, was downregulated upon &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. Our results propose that &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; may act as a master regulator of the transcription of several genes involved in LOAD pathogenesis.

The analysis of XMCQDPT2‐based geometries reveals rather weak coupling between in‐plane and out‐of‐plane structural evolution and minor energetical relaxation of three locked‐11.8 conformers. Therefore, a strong coupling between bonds length inversion and backbone out‐of‐plane deformation resulting in a very steep S1 energy profile predicted by CASSCF/CASPT2 calculations is in clear contradiction with the reference XMCQDPT2 results.

An insight from coupled cluster and multireference perturbation theory calculations</title><unread>True</unread><summary><content>The initial S1 excited‐state relaxation of retinal protonated Schiff base (RPSB) analog with central C11C12 double bond locked by eight‐membered ring (locked‐11.8) was investigated by means of multireference perturbation theory methods (XMCQDPT2, XMS‐CASPT2, MS‐CASPT2) as well as single‐reference coupled‐cluster CC2 method. The analysis of XMCQDPT2‐based geometries reveals rather weak coupling between in‐plane and out‐of‐plane structural evolution and minor energetical relaxation of three locked‐11.8 conformers. Therefore, a strong coupling between bonds length inversion and backbone out‐of‐plane deformation resulting in a very steep S1 energy profile predicted by CASSCF/CASPT2 calculations is in clear contradiction with the reference XMCQDPT2 results. Even though CC2 method predicts good quality ground‐state structures, the excited‐state structures display more advanced torsional deformation leading to ca. 0.2 eV exaggerated energy relaxation and significantly red shifted (0.4–0.7 eV) emission maxima. According to our findings, the initial photoisomerization process in locked‐11.8, and possibly in other RPSB analogs, studied fully (both geometries and energies) by multireference perturbation theory may be somewhat slower than predicted by CASSCF/CASPT2 or CC2 methods. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_1632c052b75:5eddee:c2c34441</id><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12836</link><author><name>Aditi Sharma, Sven H.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine the association between preoperational factors and patients’ short-term outcome after proximal fibular osteotomy (PFO) and to provide a basis for detailed surgical indication and patient selection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing PFO between January 2015 and December 2015. Preoperational clinical data including gender, age, duration of disease, visual analogue score (VAS) and American Knee Society (KSS) score were collected. The radiological factors including hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA angle), condyle-plateau angle (CP angle), Kellgren and Lawrence grade (KL grade), joint space width of both compartments and settlement value were also considered. Patients were followed for at 12 months postoperatively. Both clinical and functional KSS scores were obtained. The outcome of interest was divided into clinical outcome and functional outcome. For each, two criteria were defined: satisfaction and significant improvement. Satisfaction is characterized by a KSS clinical or functional score over 70 points (excellent and good results); significant improvement refers to an increase in KSS scores of more than 15 points. Bivariate logistic regression for the association between preoperational factors and outcomes of interest was performed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to detect the independent factors affecting the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 84 patients and 111 knees were followed-up. Of these, 17 knees were from males and 94 were from females. The average age was 59.45±8.82 years. The average preoperational VAS score, KSS clinical and functional score were 7.08±1.41 points, 49.14±10.95 points and 44.97±17.71 points, respectively. According to KL grading, there were 17 knees of grade 2, 47 knees of grade 3, and 47 knees of grade 4. In clinical outcomes, there were 51 knees in the satisfaction group and 77 knees in the significant improvement group. In functional outcomes, 43 knees were in the satisfaction group and 76 knees in the significant improvement group. KSS clinical score (OR = 1.134, 95%CI = 1.067–1.205, P = 0.000) was the independent factor associated with clinical satisfaction. Age (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.000–1.150, P = 0.048), VAS score (OR = 1.679, 95%CI = 1.041–2.706, P = 0.033), KSS clinical (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.005–1.144, P = 0.034) and functional (OR = 1.100, 95%CI = 1.044–1.159, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.345, 95%CI = 1.119–1.617, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 7.540, 95%CI = 1.307–43.484, P = 0.024) were the independent factors associated with functional satisfaction. KSS clinical (OR = 0.905, 95%CI = 0.850–0.963, P = 0.002) score, CP angle (OR = 0.760, 95%CI = 0.593–0.973, P = 0.030) and medial joint space width (OR = 0.001, 95%CI = 0.000–0.107, P = 0.003) were the independent factors associated with significant clinical improvement; VAS score (OR = 1.582, 95%CI = 1.042–2.402, P = 0.031), KSS functional (OR = 0.888, 95%CI = 0.838–0.942, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.292, 95%CI = 1.101–1.518, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 9.990, 95%CI = 1.485–67.197, P = 0.018) were the independent factors associated with significant functional improvement.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The independent factors affecting postoperative clinical outcome after PFO were KSS clinical score, CP angle and medial joint space width. In addition, the independent factors that influenced functional outcome included age, VAS score, KSS score, HKA angle and settlement value. As objective radiological evidence, HKA angle and settlement value could be used as an important basis for patient selection for PFO.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197980</originId><fingerprint>95b1bb0a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197980</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Liu, Wei Chen, Qi Zhang, Xiaoli Yan, Fei Zhang, Tianhua Dong, Guang Yang, Yingze Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

To improve short- and long-term outcomes, it is critical to detect at-risk sepsis patients at an early stage. Objective: Our primary goal was to develop machine learning models capable of predicting sepsis using streaming physiological data in real-time. Methods: A dataset consisting of high-frequency physiological data from 1,161 critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was analyzed in this IRB-approved retrospective observational cohort study. Of that total, 634 patients were identified to have developed sepsis. In this paper, we define sepsis as meeting the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria in the presence of the suspicion of infection. In addition to the physiological data, we include white blood cell count (WBC) to develop a model that can signal the future occurrence of sepsis. A random forest classifier was trained to discriminate between sepsis and non-sepsis patients using a total of 108 features extracted from 2-hour moving time-windows. The models were trained on 80% of the patients and were tested on the remaining 20% of the patients, for two observational periods of lengths 3 and 6 hours. Results: The models, respectively, resulted in F1 scores of 75% and 69% half-hour before sepsis onset and 79% and 76% ten minutes before sepsis onset. On average, the models were able to predict sepsis 210 minutes (3.5 hours) before the onset. Conclusions: The use of robust machine learning algorithms, continuous streams of physiological data, and WBC, allows for early identification of at-risk patients in real-time with high accuracy.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322305v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>dcf66e2e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322305v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Rationale: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality rates and expensive treatment costs.

Conclusions: The use of robust machine learning algorithms, continuous streams of physiological data, and WBC, allows for early identification of at-risk patients in real-time with high accuracy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Physiomarkers in Real-Time Physiological Data Streams Predict Adult Sepsis Onset Earlier Than Clinical Practice [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761238:93d646dc</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197728</link><author><name>Alemayehu Amberbir</name></author><published>1526936400000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197728</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alemayehu Amberbir, Victor Singano, Alfred Matengeni, Zahra Ismail, Gift Kawalazira, Adrienne K.

Background &lt;p&gt;While dyslipidemia importantly contributes to increased cardiovascular disease risk among patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), data on lipid patterns among African adults on ART are limited. We describe the prevalence of lipid abnormalities and associated factors in two HIV clinics in Malawi.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2014 and enrolled adult patients at a rural and an urban HIV clinic in Zomba district, Malawi. We recorded patient characteristics, CVD risk factors and anthropometric measurements, using the WHO STEPS validated instrument. Non-fasting samples were taken for determination of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with elevated TC and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;554 patients were enrolled, 50% at the rural HIV clinic, 72.7% were female, the median (IQR) age was 42 years (36–50); 97.3% were on ART, 84.4% on tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz, 17.5% were overweight/obese and 27.8%% had elevated waist/hip ratio. 15.5% had elevated TC, 15.9% reduced HDL-c, 28.7% had elevated TG and 3.8% had elevated TC/HDL-c ratio. Lipid abnormalities were similar in rural and urban patients. Women had significantly higher burden of elevated TC and TG whereas men had higher prevalence of reduced HDL-c. Waist-to-hip ratio was independently associated with elevated TC (aOR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.17–3.10, p = 0.01) and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio (aOR = 3.50; 95% CI: 1.38–8.85, p = 0.008). Increasing age was independently associated with elevated TC level (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI 0.51–4.59 for age 31–45; aOR = 3.69, 95% CI 1.24–10.95 for age &gt;45 years vs. ≤30 years; p-trend &amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found a moderate burden of dyslipidemia among Malawian adults on ART, which was similar in rural and urban patients but differed significantly between men and women. High waist-hip ratio predicted elevated TC and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio and may be a practical tool for CVD risk indication in resource limited settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197728</originId><fingerprint>8aece9d2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197728</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alemayehu Amberbir, Victor Singano, Alfred Matengeni, Zahra Ismail, Gift Kawalazira, Adrienne K.

The P8 stem-loop region of the &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L intron, which is known to be hypervariable in size with multiple repeat motifs and created difficulties in alignment, is always excluded in phylogenetic as well as barcode analyses. This region was investigated for species discrimination in 98 taxa of orchids belonging to the tribe Vandeae using in silico mapping of restriction site polymorphism. The length of the P8 regions varied from 200 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Aerides rosea&lt;/i&gt; to 669 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Dendrophylax sallei&lt;/i&gt;. Forty two taxa had unique lengths, while as many as eight shared a common length of 521 nucleotides. Of the 35 restriction endonucleases producing digestions in the P8 regions, three, viz., &lt;i&gt;Ags&lt;/i&gt;I, &lt;i&gt;Apo&lt;/i&gt;I and &lt;i&gt;Tsp&lt;/i&gt;DTI turned out to have recognition sites across all the 98 taxa being studied. When their restriction data were combined, 92 taxa could be discriminated leaving three taxon pairs. However, &lt;i&gt;Acampe papillosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aeranthes arachnites&lt;/i&gt; despite having similar restriction sites differed in their P8 lengths. This is the first report on thorough investigation of the P8 region of &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L intron for search of species specific restriction sites and hence its use as a potential plant DNA barcode.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196680</originId><fingerprint>8165df3</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196680</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rajkumar Kishor, G.

Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; dominant pathway for ligand binding.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v22HP1dNVjw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</link><crawled>1526665788268</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</originId><fingerprint>43541b1d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/v22HP1dNVjw/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jagannath Mondal, Navjeet Ahalawat, Subhendu Pandit, Lewis E.

Background &lt;p&gt;The discussion on the use of bevacizumab is still ongoing and often doctors are deterred from using bevacizumab due to legal or political issues. Bevacizumab is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), albeit unregistered for the disease. Therefore, in some countries ophthalmologists use the equally effective but expensive drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept. We describe the economic consequences of this dilemma surrounding AMD treatment from a societal perspective.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We modelled cost-effectiveness of treatment with ranibizumab (as-needed), aflibercept (bimonthly) and bevacizumab (as-needed). Effectiveness was estimated by systematic review and meta-analysis. The drug with the most favourable cost-effectiveness profile compared to bevacizumab was used for threshold analyses. First, we determined how much we overspend per injection. Second, we calculated the required effectiveness to justify the current price and the reasonable price for a drug leading to optimal vision. Finally, we estimated how much Europe overspends if bevacizumab is not first choice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab treatment costs €27,087 per year, about €4,000 less than aflibercept and €6,000 less than ranibizumab. With similar effectiveness for all drugs as shown by meta-analysis, bevacizumab was the most cost-effective. Aflibercept was chosen for threshold analyses. Aflibercept costs €943 per injection, but we determined that the maximum price to be cost-effective is €533. Alternatively, at its current price, aflibercept should yield about twice the visual gain. Even when optimal vision can be achieved, the maximum price for any treatment is €37,453 per year. Most importantly, Europe overspends €335 million yearly on AMD treatment when choosing aflibercept over bevacizumab.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab is the most cost-effective treatment for AMD, yet is not the standard of care across Europe. The registered drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept lead to large overspending without additional health benefits. Health authorities should consider taking steps to implement bevacizumab into clinical practice as first choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197670</originId><fingerprint>ec939012</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197670</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Freekje van Asten, Charlotte T.

Health authorities should consider taking steps to implement bevacizumab into clinical practice as first choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>The cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration—A cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526590800000</updated></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4ed:3dd877af</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198165</link><author><name>Tanapat Pangeson</name></author><published>1527195600000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198165</canonicalUrl><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tanapat Pangeson, Torpong Sanguansermsri, Khwanruedee Mahingsa, Phanchana Sanguansermsri&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to identify potential CpG site(s) or DNA methylation pattern(s) in the pseudo α-globin 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene), the gene which locates in α-thalassemia-1 deletion mutation, to differentiate plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;DNA methylation profiles of placenta and peripheral blood from the MethBase database were compared to screen differentially methylated regions. This region was confirmed the differential by methylation-sensitive high resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. The differential region was used to compare DNA methylation profile of plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women by bisulfite amplicon sequencing in three levels: overall, individual CpG sites and individual molecules (DNA methylation patterns).&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Using MethBase data, four consecutive CpG sites in the &lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene were identified as regions of differential DNA methylation between placenta and peripheral blood. The confirmation by MS-HRM showed the differential DNA methylation profile between the placenta and plasma from non-pregnant women. The comparison of DNA methylation profiles between the plasma of pregnant and non-pregnant women showed that, in the overall levels of the four CpG sites, DNA methylation of pregnant women was detected at lower levels than non-pregnant women. In the individual CpG site level, only the second CpG site showed differential DNA methylation between the groups. In the DNA methylation pattern level, there was no strongly significant differences in DNA methylation patterns between the pregnant and non-pregnant groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our result demonstrated that, in the plasma from pregnant women, only one of the four CpG sites displays a decrease in DNA methylation compared with non-pregnant women. It indicates that this CpG site might be useful for determining the presence or absence of fetal wild-type α-globin gene cluster allele in maternal plasma.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198165</originId><fingerprint>5ae0903e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198165</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tanapat Pangeson, Torpong Sanguansermsri, Khwanruedee Mahingsa, Phanchana Sanguansermsri&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of two forms (CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CuS); and Cu nanoparticles (CuNP)) and dosages (standard 6.5 mg/kg (H), half of the standard (L)) of additional dietary Cu administered to growing rats on gastrointestinal and hepatic function and morphology. Copper in the form of CuNP vs CuS caused lower Cu faecal/urinal excretion and increased Cu accumulation in the brain tissue. Hepatic high-grade hydropic degeneration and necrotic lesions were observed only in the CuNP-H animals. In the lower gut, the dietary application of CuNP stifled bacterial enzymatic activity of caecal gut microbiota and resulted in lower SCFA production. That diminishing effect of CuNP on caecal microbiota activity was accompanied by a relative increase in the secretion of glycoside hydrolases by bacterial cells. The results showed that in comparison to Cu from CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Cu nanoparticles to a greater extent were absorbed from the intestine, accumulated in brain tissue, exerted antimicrobial effect in the caecum, and at higher dietary dose caused damages in the liver of rats.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197083</originId><fingerprint>2b7ea5d4</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197083</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ewelina Cholewińska, Katarzyna Ognik, Bartosz Fotschki, Zenon Zduńczyk, Jerzy Juśkiewicz&lt;/p&gt;

analysis of isomeric equilibria for small M+(H2O)n clusters, with M = Li, Na, K, Rb,
and Cs, from 0 K to 200 K. To determine the relative stability of different isomers of each M+(H2O)n cluster as a function of temperature, replica exchange simulations are
carried out at both classical and quantum levels with the recently developed many-body
MB-nrg potential energy functions, which have been shown to exhibit chemical accuracy. Anharmonic vibrational spectra are then calculated within the local monomer
approximation and found to be in agreement with the available experimental data,
providing further support for the accuracy of the MB-nrg potential energy functions.
The present analysis indicates that nuclear quantum effects become increasingly im-
portant for larger M+(H2O)n clusters containing the heavier alkali metal ions, which
is explained in terms of competing ion-water and water-water interactions along with
the interplay between energetic and entropic effects. Directly connecting experimental
measurements with molecular properties calculated at the quantum mechanical level,
this study represents a further step toward the development of a consistent picture of
ion hydration from the gas to the condensed phase.</description><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Isomeric_Equilibria_Nuclear_Quantum_Effects_and_Vibrational_Spectra_of_M_H2O_n_1_3_Clusters_with_M_Li_Na_K_Rb_and_Cs_Through_Many-Body_Representations/6223694</originId><fingerprint>bbede9f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Isomeric_Equilibria_Nuclear_Quantum_Effects_and_Vibrational_Spectra_of_M_H2O_n_1_3_Clusters_with_M_Li_Na_K_Rb_and_Cs_Through_Many-Body_Representations/6223694</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Isomeric Equilibria, Nuclear Quantum Effects, and Vibrational Spectra of M+(H2O)n=1−3 Clusters, with M = Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs, Through Many-Body Representations</title><summary><content>A quantitative characterization of the molecular mechanisms that regulate ion solvation is key to the microscopic understanding of fundamental processes taking place in

Over the last decades, the treatment of schizophrenia has shifted fundamentally from a focus on symptom reduction to a focus on recovery and improving aspects of functioning. In this study, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on social cognitive and nonsocial neurocognitive functions, as well as on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures, in individuals with schizophrenia. Thirty-seven individuals with schizophrenia were administered one of three different tDCS conditions (cathodal, anodal, and sham) per visit over the course of three visits, with approximately one week between each visit. Order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. For the active conditions, the electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the reference electrode over right supraorbital cortex. Current intensity was 2 mA and was maintained for two 20-minute sessions, with a one hour break between the sessions. Assessments were conducted immediately following each session, in a counterbalanced order of administration. No systematic effects were found across the social and nonsocial cognitive domains, and no significant effects were detected on event-related potentials (ERPs). The very small effect sizes, further validated by &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; power analyses (large Critical Ns), demonstrated that these findings were not due to lack of statistical power. Except for mild local discomfort, no significant side effects were reported. Findings demonstrate the safety and ease of administration of this procedure, but suggest that a single dose of tDCS over these areas does not yield a therapeutic effect on cognition in schizophrenia.

Background &lt;p&gt;In airway epithelium, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22) are induced by defective epithelial barriers such as E-cadherin and attract the effector cells of Th2 immunity. However, the association between the epithelial barrier and CCL17 expression has not been studied in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). Thus, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CCL17 and its regulation by Th cytokines in nasal polyp (NP) epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The expression and distribution of CCL17, CCL22, E-cadherin and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were measured using real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry and compared between normal ethmoid sinus epithelium and NP epithelium. In addition, the expression level of CCL17 was determined in cultured epithelial cells treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The expression of CCL17 was decreased in the NP epithelium compared to the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus, whereas the expression of CCL22 was not decreased. E-cadherin was differentially distributed between the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus and NP epithelium. EGFR was also decreased in NPs. Interestingly, the stimulation of cultured epithelial cells with Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, resulted in an upregulation of CCL17 expression only in NP epithelial cells whereas the expression of CCL17 was increased in both normal epithelial cells and NP epithelial cells by Th1 cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decreased expression of CCL17 in defective NP epithelium may be closely connected to NP pathogenesis and can be differentially regulated by cytokines in the NP epithelium of patients with CRSwNP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197355</originId><fingerprint>3145940b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197355</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Byoungjae Kim, Hyun-Ji Lee, Nu-Ri Im, Doh Young Lee, Ha Kyun Kim, Cha Young Kang, Il-Ho Park, Seung Hoon Lee, Heung-Man Lee, Sang Hag Lee, Seung-Kuk Baek, Tae Hoon Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Repeated concussion is becoming increasingly recognized as a serious public health concern around the world. Moreover, there is a greater awareness amongst health professionals of the potential for repeated pediatric concussions to detrimentally alter the structure and function of the developing brain. To better study this issue, we developed an awake closed head injury (ACHI) model that enabled repeated concussions to be performed reliably and reproducibly in juvenile rats. A neurological assessment protocol (NAP) score was generated immediately after each ACHI to help quantify the cumulative effects of repeated injury on level of consciousness, and basic motor and reflexive capacity. Here we show that we can produce a repeated ACHI (4 impacts in two days) in both male and female juvenile rats without significant mortality or pain. We show that both single and repeated injuries produce acute neurological deficits resembling clinical concussion symptoms that can be quantified using the NAP score. Behavioural analyses indicate repeated ACHI acutely impaired spatial memory in the Barnes maze, and an interesting sex effect was revealed as memory impairment correlated moderately with poorer NAP score performance in a subset of females. These cognitive impairments occurred in the absence of motor impairments on the Rotarod, or emotional changes in the open field and elevated plus mazes. Cresyl violet histology and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that repeated ACHI did not produce significant structural damage. MRI also confirmed there was no volumetric loss in the cortex, hippocampus, or corpus callosum of animals at 1 or 7 days post-ACHI. Together these data indicate that the ACHI model can provide a reliable, high throughput means to study the effects of concussions in juvenile rats.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197187</originId><fingerprint>288c5762</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197187</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alicia Meconi, Ryan C.

The anti-inflammatory properties of sand fly saliva favor the establishment of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania infantum&lt;/i&gt; infection. In contrast, an antibody response against &lt;i&gt;Lutzomyia longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; saliva is often associated with a protective cell-mediated response against canine visceral leishmaniasis. Genetic studies may demonstrate to what extent the ability to secrete anti-saliva antibodies depends on genetic or environmental factors. However, the genetic basis of canine antibody response against sand fly saliva has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with the anti-&lt;i&gt;Lu&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; salivary IgG response in 189 dogs resident in endemic areas in order to provide information for prophylactic strategies. Dogs were classified into five groups based on serological and parasitological diagnosis and clinical evaluation. Anti-salivary gland homogenate (SGH) IgG levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and genotyped using a SNP chip with 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The following linear regression model was fitted: IgG level = mean + origin + sex + age + use of a repellent collar, and the residuals were assumed as pseudo-phenotypes for the association test between phenotypes and genotypes (GWA). A component of variance model that takes into account polygenic and sample structure effects (EMMAX) was employed for GWA. Phenotypic findings indicated that anti-SGH IgG levels remained higher in exposed and subclinically infected dogs than in severely diseased dogs even in regression model residuals. Five associated markers were identified on chromosomes 2, 20 and 31. The mapped genes included &lt;i&gt;CD180&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RP105&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MITF&lt;/i&gt; related to the rapid activation of B lymphocytes and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells.

Complex innovations– ideas, practices, and technologies that hold uncertain benefits for potential adopters—often vary in their ability to diffuse in different communities over time. To explain why, I develop a model of innovation adoption in which agents engage in naïve (DeGroot) learning about the value of an innovation within their social networks. Using simulations on Bernoulli random graphs, I examine how adoption varies with network properties and with the distribution of initial opinions and adoption thresholds. The results show that: (i) low-density and high-asymmetry networks produce polarization in influence to adopt an innovation over time, (ii) increasing network density and asymmetry promote adoption under a variety of opinion and threshold distributions, and (iii) the optimal levels of density and asymmetry in networks depend on the distribution of thresholds: networks with high density (&gt;0.25) and high asymmetry (&gt;0.50) are optimal for maximizing diffusion when adoption thresholds are right-skewed (i.e., barriers to adoption are low), but networks with low density (&amp;lt;0.01) and low asymmetry (&amp;lt;0.25) are optimal when thresholds are left-skewed. I draw on data from a diffusion field experiment to predict adoption over time and compare the results to observed outcomes.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196699</originId><fingerprint>381cc6fc</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196699</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Valentina A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), particularly pathologic complete response (pCR), is an independent predictor of favorable clinical outcome in breast cancer (BC). The accuracy of residual disease measurement and reporting is of critical importance in treatment planning and prognosis for these patients. Currently, gross pathological evaluation of the residual tumor bed is the greatest determinant for accurate reporting of NACT response. Fluorescence imaging (FI) is a new technology that is being evaluated for use in the detection of tumors in different oncological conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate whether indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) is able to detect residual breast tumor tissue after NACT in breast surgical operative specimens.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients who underwent NACT for BC and were admitted for breast surgery were selected for participation in this study. Free ICG (0.25 mg/kg) was injected intraoperatively. Tumor-to-background fluorescence ratio (TBFR) was calculated on ex vivo samples from the surgical specimen.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and seventy-two samples from nine breast surgical specimens were evaluated for their fluorescence intensity. Among them, 52 were malignant (30.2%) and 120 were benign (69.8%). The mean TBFR was 3.3 (SD 1.68) in malignant samples and 1.9 (SD 0.97) in benign samples (p = 0.0002). With a TBFR cut-off value of 1.3, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, false negative rate, and false positive rate of ICG-FI to predict residual tumoral disease in breast surgical samples post-NACT were 94.2%, 31.7%, 92.7%, 5.8%, and 68.3%, respectively. If we restricted our analysis to only patients who achieved pCR, the negative predictive value for ICG-FI was 100%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These first observations indicate that ex vivo ICG-FI is sensitive but not sufficiently specific to discriminate between benign breast tissue and malignant residual tissue.

Ferroptosis is a cell death process driven by damage to cell membranes and linked to numerous human diseases. Ferroptosis is caused by loss of activity of the key enzyme that is tasked with repairing oxidative damage to cell membranes—glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). GPX4 normally removes the dangerous products of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, protecting cell membranes from this type of damage; when GPX4 fails, ferroptosis ensues. Ferroptosis is distinct from apoptosis, necroptosis, necrosis, and other modes of cell death. Several key mysteries regarding how cells die during ferroptosis remain unsolved. First, the drivers of lipid peroxidation are not yet clear. Second, the subcellular location of lethal lipid peroxides remains an outstanding question. Finally, how exactly lipid peroxidation leads to cell death is an unsolved mystery. Answers to these questions will provide insights into the mechanisms of ferroptotic cell death and associated human diseases, as well as new therapeutic strategies for such diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LCHMnGYG4g0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006203</link><crawled>1527183909217</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006203</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006203</originId><fingerprint>e4a45b7a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/LCHMnGYG4g0/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Huizhong Feng, Brent R.

Jasmonates (JAs) are signalling molecules involved in stress responses, development and secondary metabolism biosynthesis, although their roles in fleshy-fruit development and ripening processes are not well known. In strawberry fruit, it has been proposed that JAs could regulate the early development through the activation of the JAs biosynthesis. Moreover, it has been reported that JA treatment increases anthocyanin content in strawberry fruit involving the bioactive jasmonate biosynthesis. Nevertheless, JA signalling pathway, of which main components are the COI1-JAZ co-receptor and the MYC transcription factors (TFs), has not been characterized in strawberry until now. Here we identified and characterized the woodland strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;) JAZ and MYC genes as well as studied their expression during development and ripening stages in commercial strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;) fruit. We described twelve putative JAZ proteins and two MYC TFs, which showed high conservation with respect to their orthologs in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and in other fleshy-fruit species such as &lt;i&gt;Malus&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;domestica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; as revealed by gene synteny and phylogenetic analyses. Noteworthy, their expression levels exhibited a significant decrease from fruit development to ripening stages in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;, along with others of the JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaNINJA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FaJAM&lt;/i&gt;s, encoding for negative regulators of JA responses. Moreover, we found that main JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaMYC2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;FaJAZ1&lt;/i&gt; are promptly induced by JA treatment at early times in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit. These results suggest the conservation of the canonical JA signalling pathway in strawberry and a possible role of this pathway in early strawberry fruit development, which also correlates negatively with the beginning of the ripening process.</description><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197118</originId><fingerprint>114197ce</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197118</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Adrián Garrido-Bigotes, Nicolás E.

A growing literature has been developed demonstrating the clinical relevance of a biomathematical model, the Proliferation-Invasion (PI) model, of glioblastoma growth. Of interest here is the development of a treatment response metric, Days Gained (DG). This metric is based on individual tumor kinetics estimated through segmented volumes of hyperintense regions on T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced (T1Gd) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs). This metric was shown to be prognostic of time to progression. Further, it was shown to be more prognostic of outcome than standard response metrics. While promising, the original paper did not account for uncertainty in the calculation of the DG metric leaving the robustness of this cutoff in question. We harness the Bayesian framework to consider the impact of two sources of uncertainty: 1) image acquisition and 2) interobserver error in image segmentation. We first utilize synthetic data to characterize what non-error variants are influencing the final uncertainty in the DG metric. We then consider the original patient cohort to investigate clinical patterns of uncertainty and to determine how robust this metric is for predicting time to progression and overall survival. Our results indicate that the key clinical variants are the time between pre-treatment images and the underlying tumor growth kinetics, matching our observations in the clinical cohort. Finally, we demonstrated that for this cohort there was a continuous range of cutoffs between 94 and 105 for which the prediction of the time to progression and was over 80\% reliable. While further validation must be done, this work represents a key step in ascertaining the clinical utility of this metric.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325340v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>3f66da56</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325340v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Glioblastomas, lethal primary brain tumors, are known for their heterogeneity and invasiveness.

Testudinid herpesviruses (TeHVs) have a worldwide distribution among tortoises. However, information such as risk factors promoting the occurrence or the recrudescence of the associated disease and the mid-term sequelae of an outbreak comprising the extent and dynamic of the viral shedding have been only minimally investigated. Critical management information is also lacking or anecdotal. Furthermore, major aspects of the viral pathogenesis including the likelihood of vertical transmission of the virus are virtually unknown. The present study describes the occurrence and the management of an outbreak of &lt;i&gt;Testudinid herpesvirus&lt;/i&gt; genotype 3 (TeHV3) in a large, private collection of chelonians.

Testudinid herpesviruses (TeHVs) have a worldwide distribution among tortoises. However, information such as risk factors promoting the occurrence or the recrudescence of the associated disease and the mid-term sequelae of an outbreak comprising the extent and dynamic of the viral shedding have been only minimally investigated. Critical management information is also lacking or anecdotal. Furthermore, major aspects of the viral pathogenesis including the likelihood of vertical transmission of the virus are virtually unknown. The present study describes the occurrence and the management of an outbreak of &lt;i&gt;Testudinid herpesvirus&lt;/i&gt; genotype 3 (TeHV3) in a large, private collection of chelonians. Clinical, pathological, molecular and serological characterization of the outbreak were carried out. Seventy-five percent of the infected tortoises died. Complementation of molecular and serological testing was a critical point for successful management implementations. A case-control study was performed to analyze possible risk factors associated with the infection. Furthermore, a subgroup of six asymptomatic infected tortoises was monitored for two consecutive seasons after the outbreak: all the infected tortoises were determined to be intermittent shedders, except one, which was a persistent shedder. Post-hibernation was associated with the highest number of shedders. Finally, evidence of the most likely vertical transmission of the virus was obtained for the first time.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Clinical, virological and epidemiological characterization of an outbreak of Testudinid Herpesvirus 3 in a chelonian captive breeding facility: Lessons learned and first evidence of TeHV3 vertical transmission</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525986000000</updated></item><item><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_16393683200:64de42:f3bf0074</id><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00140</link><author><name>Samo Turk, Benjamin Merget, Sameh Eid, Simone Fulle</name></author><published>1527134400000</published><origin><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00140/20180523/images/medium/jm-2018-001408_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00140&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

New biotic stresses have emerged around the globe over the last decades threatening food safety and security. In 2016, scientists confirmed the presence of the devastating wheat-blast disease in Bangladesh, South Asia–its first occurrence outside South America. Severely blast-affected wheat fields had their grain yield wiped out. This poses a severe threat to food security in a densely-populated region with millions of poor inhabitants where wheat is a major staple crop and per capita wheat consumption has been increasing. As an &lt;i&gt;ex ante&lt;/i&gt; impact assessment, this study examined potential wheat-blast scenarios in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Based on the agro-climatic conditions in the epicenter, where the disease was first identified in Bangladesh in 2016, this study identified the correspondingly vulnerable areas in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh amounting to 7 million ha. Assuming a conservative scenario of 5–10% for blast-induced wheat production loss, this study estimated the annual potential wheat loss across the sampled countries to be 0.89–1.77 million tons, equivalent to USD 132–264 million. Such losses further threaten an already-precarious national food security, putting pressure on wheat imports and wheat prices.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work in this paper on the synthetic procedures, both to prepare these compounds and to investigate their chemistry. What it tells you is that (as you would have figured) that C-to-Si is a nontrivial switch in the fume hood, because the chemistries involved can be quite different. For instance, that first core on the list does N-alkylation and N-acylation reactions just fine, but when you try to do metal-catalyzed N-C couplings on it, things go to pieces (protodesilylation and other decomposition reactions). Protodesilylation in general was something that had to be looked out for, with attention paid to solvent choice and temperature in the reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme that comes up several times is that the nitrogens, when exposed to base, can be significantly more prone to oxidative side reactions than expected (even fairly simple reductive amination reactions had to be performed under inert atmosphere, although they were successful then). Metalation reactions were also tricky. Some of them worked just fine and reacted as expected with a range of electrophiles, while others would work with some partners but not others. But some of them just fell apart immediately on attempts to form the anions (such as C2 of the second compound on the list shown), and the only way to find that out was to try them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the group was able to prepare an impressive range of functionalized derivatives of these cores, almost all of which are shots into unknown territory. How, then, do such compounds behave? Their cLogP values are almost invariably higher than their carbon analogs, but as usual when you move into unusual structure space, it would be interesting to have some experimental values to make sure that that some of this just isn’t a problem with the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the Si and C matched pairs in assays, there seems to be no difference in P-gp transporter behavior &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, for starters. There was a slight trend towards more instability against CYP enzymes, but this wasn’t universal (and was also species-dependent, with the rat enzymes being more vigorous. (That’s often the case; rats have a reputation for having more strongly oxidizing liver enzymes, which I’ve always attributed to their rather broad definitions of suitable food). Inhibition of these enzymes didn’t show much of a trend one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second compound on the list above and its carbon analog were compared in rat PK experiments as well (oral and i.v.) Intravenous behavior was fairly similar – the Si compound had slightly higher clearance and slightly higher volume of distribution. As for p.o. dosing, the Si compound is significantly more bioavailable, although it has a lower Cmax. Overall AUC was pretty much the same, though. And even though it had greater instability to the rat enzymes, it had a twofold great half-life&lt;em&gt; in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, which makes you think plasma protein binding. So this is only one point, but taken with the other Si compounds in the literature, it seems as if they fall inside the normal range of variation that you see with all-carbon compounds – there’s nothing intrinsically weird about them from a pharmacokinetic/metabolic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up what I mentioned in my past last year, though: perhaps it would be better for silicon-containing drugs if there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; something unusual about them. Admittedly, that could also be “unusually bad”, but overall, it’s harder to make the case for moving to silicon if the effects of doing so are (a) not huge and (b) not all that predictable. You’re already in that zone with carbon analogs, most likely, so why bother? The paper itself has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This lack of success in the pharmaceutical industry may be attributed to two key factors: (1) an absence of general and accessible synthetic methods for the construction of appropriately functionalized silicon-containing molecules and (2) ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon, of which the “carbon/silicon switch” is the most common. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that second point is what we’re talking about. “Ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon”, from another angle, means “lack of a good reason to use it at all”. If some effective uses for it can be found – and they may well be out there, who knows? – then things will change. But not until then. If the late-stage silicon switch doesn’t necessarily get you anything, it’s true that you’re going to have to look earlier (good activity in a silicon-containing compound that isn’t replicated by its carbon analog), and this work is an attempt to provide a host of new Si-containing chemical matter towards that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would go a long way to answering the overall question would be if someone were to produce a library of (say) ten or twenty thousand diverse silicon-containing drug-like structures and their exact carbon analogs, and do some high-throughput screening campaigns (variously targeted, cellular, and phenotypic) to see how they behave. But no one’s going to go to that trouble just yet, for just the reasons described (an absence of ways to make such things and an absence of compelling reasons to make them). The chicken and egg question remains.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Denmark-Si.jpeg</url><width>1054</width><height>184</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><keywords><item>Chemical News</item><item>Drug Assays</item><item>Odd Elements in Drugs</item><item>Pharmacokinetics</item></keywords><title>Silicon In Drug Molecules, Revisited</title><unread>True</unread><summary><content>Here’s an update to a post from last year about silicon in drug-like molecules.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Patients who have incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and an estimated intermediate risk (5–60%) of lung cancer frequently are followed via computed tomography (CT) surveillance to detect nodule growth, despite guidelines for a more aggressive diagnostic strategy. We examined the cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (AABT)—Early Cancer Detection Test-Lung (EarlyCDT-Lung&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;)—as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer among such patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate use of the AABT versus CT surveillance alone. In the model, patients with a positive AABT—because they are at substantially enhanced risk of lung cancer—are assumed to go directly to biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of lung cancer in earlier stages than under current guidelines (a beneficial stage shift).

Objective &lt;p&gt;Patients who have incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and an estimated intermediate risk (5–60%) of lung cancer frequently are followed via computed tomography (CT) surveillance to detect nodule growth, despite guidelines for a more aggressive diagnostic strategy. We examined the cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (AABT)—Early Cancer Detection Test-Lung (EarlyCDT-Lung&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;)—as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer among such patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate use of the AABT versus CT surveillance alone. In the model, patients with a positive AABT—because they are at substantially enhanced risk of lung cancer—are assumed to go directly to biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of lung cancer in earlier stages than under current guidelines (a beneficial stage shift). Patients with a negative AABT, and those scheduled for CT surveillance alone, are assumed to have periodic CT screenings to detect rapid growth and thus to have their lung cancers diagnosed—on average—at more advanced stages.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 1,000 patients who have incidentally detected nodules 8–30 mm, have an intermediate-risk of lung cancer, and are evaluated by CT surveillance alone, 95 (9.5%) are assumed to have lung cancer (local, 73.6%; regional, 22.0%; distant, 4.4%).

Long reads, which are nowadays cheaper to produce and more widely available than ever before, have been used to reduce the fragmentation of the assembled haplotypes since their ability to span several variants along the genome. These long reads are also characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long reads deal only with limited coverages. Results: Here, we propose a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method to significantly reduce the required computational resources, allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool, HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up to 60x coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower runtimes. Conclusions: Our method leverages the long-range information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.

Heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans and mice cause severe ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). Abnormalities include pupil displacement, corneal opacity, iridocorneal adhesions, and variable intraocular pressure, as well as some retinal and vascular defects. It is presently not known what source of BMP4 is responsible for these defects, as BMP4 is expressed in several developing ocular and surrounding tissues. In particular, BMP4 is expressed in the ciliary margins of the optic cup which give rise to anterior segment structures such as the ciliary body and iris, making it a good candidate for the required source of BMP4 for anterior segment development. Here, we test whether ciliary margin-derived BMP4 is required for ocular development using two different conditional knockout approaches. In addition, we compared the conditional deletion phenotypes with &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous null mice. Morphological, molecular, and functional assays were performed on adult mutant mice, including histology, immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging, and intraocular pressure measurements. Surprisingly, in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mutants, our analyses revealed that the anterior and posterior segments of &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockouts developed normally. These results indicate that ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development, although subtle alterations could not be ruled out. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anterior and posterior phenotypes observed in &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous animals showed a strong propensity to co-occur, suggesting a common, non-cell autonomous source for these defects.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197048</originId><fingerprint>8f86ac9c</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197048</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Next generation sequencing tests (NGS) are usually performed on relatively small core biopsy or fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples.

This study aimed to investigate the molecular pathways involved in muscle wasting in an animal model of osteoarthritis (OA) induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) in rats. Reduction of protein syntheses, increased proteolysis and impaired muscle regeneration are important pathways related to muscle wasting, and myogenin, MyoD, myostatin and MuRF-1 are some of their markers. Female Wistar rats were allocated into two groups: OA (submitted to the ACLT) and SHAM (submitted to surgery without ACLT). Nociception, spontaneous exploratory locomotion and body weight of animals were evaluated weekly. Twelve weeks after the disease induction, animals were euthanized, and the right knee joints were collected. Gastrocnemius muscle of the right hind paw were dissected and weighed. Gastrocnemius was used for evaluation of muscle atrophy and expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, Pax7, myogenin, MyoD, myostatin and MuRF-1. Histopathology of the knee confirmed the development of the disease in animals of OA group. Gastrocnemius of OA animals showed a reduction of about 10% in area and an increased IL-1β expression compared to animals of SHAM group. Expression of myostatin was increased in OA group, while myogenin expression was decreased. TNF-α, Pax7, MuRF-1 and MyoD expression was similar in both OA and SHAM groups. Nociception was significantly elevated in OA animals in the last two weeks of experimental period. Spontaneous exploratory locomotion, body weight and weight of gastrocnemius showed no difference between OA and SHAM groups. Gastrocnemius atrophy in OA induced by ACLT involves elevated expression of IL-1β within the muscle, as well as increased expression of myostatin and decreased expression of myogenin. Therefore, muscle wasting may be linked to impaired muscle regeneration.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196682</originId><fingerprint>3c29cbd8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196682</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jordana Miranda de Souza Silva, Paulo Vinicius Gil Alabarse, Vivian de Oliveira Nunes Teixeira, Eduarda Correa Freitas, Francine Hehn de Oliveira, Rafael Mendonça da Silva Chakr, Ricardo Machado Xavier&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Up to 25% of acute stroke patients first note symptoms upon awakening. We hypothesized that patients awaking with stroke symptoms may be safely treated with intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) using non-contrast head CT (NCHCT), if they meet all other standard criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The SAfety of Intravenous thromboLytics in stroke ON awakening (SAIL ON) was a prospective, open-label, single treatment arm, pilot safety trial of standard dose IV tPA in patients who presented with stroke symptoms within 0–4.5 hours of awakening. From January 30, 2013, to September 1, 2015, twenty consecutive wakeup stroke patients selected by NCHCT were enrolled. The primary outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in the first 36 hours. Secondary outcomes included NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) at 24 hours; and modified Rankin Score (mRS), NIHSS, and Barthel index at 90 days.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The average age was 65 years (range 47–83); 40% were women; 50% were African American. The average NIHSS was 6 (range 4–11). The average time from wake-up to IV tPA was 205 minutes (range 114–270). The average time from last known well to IV tPA was 580 minutes (range 353–876). The median mRS at 90 days was 1 (range 0–5). No patients had sICH; two of 20 (10%) had asymptomatic ICH on routine post IV tPA brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Administration of IV tPA was feasible and may be safe in wakeup stroke patients presenting within 4.5 hours from awakening, screened with NCHCT.

Thus, there is a compelling need for robust 3D nuclear morphometric techniques to carry out population-wise analysis. We propose a new approach that combines modeling, analysis, and interpretation of morphometric characteristics of cell nuclei and nucleoli in 3D. We use robust surface reconstruction that allows accurate approximation of 3D object boundary. Then, we compute geometric morphological measures characterizing the form of cell nuclei and nucleoli. Using these features, we compare over 450 nuclei with about 1,000 nucleoli of epithelial and mesenchymal prostate cancer cells, as well as 1,000 nuclei with over 2,000 nucleoli from serum-starved and proliferating fibroblast cells. Classification of sets of 9 and 15 cells achieves accuracy of 95.4% and 98%, respectively, for prostate cancer cells, and 95% and 98% for fibroblast cells.

Bloodstream infection (BSI) and associated sepsis represent a major source of mortality in industrialized countries. Prompt treatment with targeted antibiotics affects both the financial impact and the clinical outcome of BSI: every hour gained in initiating the correct antimicrobial therapy significantly increases the probability of patient survival. However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%.

Bloodstream infection (BSI) and associated sepsis represent a major source of mortality in industrialized countries. Prompt treatment with targeted antibiotics affects both the financial impact and the clinical outcome of BSI: every hour gained in initiating the correct antimicrobial therapy significantly increases the probability of patient survival. However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%. The clinical significance of discrepant results was evaluated reviewing the patients’ clinical records and the results of additional relevant microbiological tests. The data here obtained support the ability of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay to identify a broad range of bacteria directly from primary whole blood samples, within eight hours. This might allow a timely administration of a suitable treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Rapid diagnosis of bloodstream infections in the critically ill: Evaluation of the broad-range PCR/ESI-MS technology</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526418000000</updated></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219f:93d646dc</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197339</link><author><name>Louis-Solal Giboin</name></author><published>1526331600000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197339</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Louis-Solal Giboin, Ehsan Amiri, Raphael Bertschinger, Markus Gruber&lt;/p&gt;

We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects.

Not because it’s useful – that’s already known – but because it can explode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b00270&quot;&gt;Here’s the paper&lt;/a&gt; (from UC-Irvine and Amgen), and the compound is the 4-azido derivative of phenylalanine. Interestingly, the authors were not trying to investigate its hazards, but were after an easier, safer, and cheaper synthetic route. They succeeded, by the way, along with providing some valuable reference work about how to determine its chiral purity and also (re)establishing a poorly characterized coupling reagent (Boc-Oxyma) as a useful species. Now, some people will look at this target compound and say “Well, yeah, sure, azide”, but organoazides are not all explosive. The lower the molecular weight, the more likely you are to run into trouble, but there are smaller azides than this one that still aren’t a problem to handle. I’ll say right off that I don’t know of any incidents with azido-Phe, which is a good thing, but the data in this paper suggest that such an incident is certainly possible. More on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns about the synthetic routes to this compound, I should note, is the presence of an azide ion / copper combination. It is a very solid general rule to avoid the formation of any transition-metal or heavy-metal azide species; they should all be considered explosion hazards (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/08/28/mercury_azides_ill_get_right_on_those_for_you&quot;&gt;“Things I Won’t Work With” reference&lt;/a&gt;, for emphasis). Want some more backing for that statement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The sensitivity of dry cupric azide to friction is so great that it is prone to explosion &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/257189.pdf&quot;&gt;during its removal&lt;/a&gt; from filter paper. Copper(I) azide (cuprous azide) is similarly perilous, and explosions have been reported for this complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.19110244402&quot;&gt;while completely submerged&lt;/a&gt; in water and after being lightly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/257189.pdf&quot;&gt;touched with a feather&lt;/a&gt; in open air. An intelligence bulletin from The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health warned in 1976 that several explosions had occurred in the United States and Canada, apparently resulting from the accumulation of heavy-metal azides in hospital plumbing. These events were likely due to the routine disposal of NaN3-laced waste from automatic blood cell counting machines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/78-127/78127_13.html&quot;&gt;directly into hospital drains&lt;/a&gt;. Since many of these incidents occurred while attempting to clear a blocked pipe, it seems unlikely that any metal azides present were dry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said the manuscript, dryly. So no, I don’t think we’ll be wanting any copper azide species if that can be helped (the covalent azides used in the copper-catalyzed “click” reaction are a different thing altogether). Since this new synthesis does still involve a copper-catalyzed azide formation, the authors carefully investigated the material in each step for explosion hazards. The good news is that none of the intermediates (nor the precipitates formed) seem to be hazardous. The bad news is that the final product is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was determined through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a technique where a (small!) sample is heated to increasing temperatures and monitored for excess heat being given off (exothermic decomposition), and its partner technique, accelerating-rate calorimetry (ARC). What these show is that the N-Boc derivative of azido-Phe is possibly a cause for concern, but the unprotected species is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; a problem. Its calorimetric behavior is similar to that of a high explosive, and it appears as if it could be shock-sensitive as well. I would say that this problem is unappreciated in the chemical literature, and it’s a good thing that no one discovered this the hard way. Perhaps a salt of the compound has better behavior and would be a safer reagent and article of commerce?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Wild bees are essential pollinators whose survival partly depends on the capacity of their environment to offer a sufficient amount of nectar and pollen. Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a generalist mining bee, &lt;i&gt;Andrena cineraria&lt;/i&gt;, that forages and reproduces during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; was explained by the interaction between flower density in the grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators. Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed rape resources.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197684</originId><fingerprint>6a8112f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197684</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Colin Van Reeth, Gaël Caro, Christian Bockstaller, Nadia Michel&lt;/p&gt;

Prevalence and molecular epidemiology studies for hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus are scarce in Warao Amerindians from Venezuela, where an epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has recently been documented. To carry out a molecular epidemiology analysis of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus in Warao individuals from the Delta Amacuro State of Venezuela. A total of 548 sera were tested for serological and molecular markers for HBV and HCV. The prevalence of active infection (presence of HBV surface antigen, HBsAg), exposure to HBV (presence of Antibody to HBV core antigen, anti-HBc) and anti-HCV, was 1.8%, 13% and 0% respectively. HBV exposure was significantly lower in men below 18 years old and also lower than rates previously reported in other Amerindian communities from Venezuela. Thirty one percent (31%, 25/80) of individuals without evidence of HBV infection exhibited anti-HBs titer ≥ 10U.I / ml, being significantly more frequent in individuals younger than 20 years. A higher HBV exposure was observed among HIV-1 positive individuals (33% vs 11%, p &amp;lt;0.005). A high prevalence of occult HBV infection was also observed (5.6%, 11/195). Phylogenetic analysis of S gene and complete HBV genomes showed that F3 is the only circulating subgenotype, different from the F2 subgenotype found in 1991 in this population. These results suggest a recent introduction of subgenotype F3, with a low divergence among the isolates. These results highlight the importance of molecular epidemiology studies for viral control, and support the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing transmission of HBV.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197662</originId><fingerprint>c4313e9e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197662</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ruth Y.

Before organizing mixed-mode data collection for the self-administered questionnaire of the Belgian Health Interview Survey, measurement effects between the paper-and-pencil and the web-based questionnaire were evaluated. A two-period cross-over study was organized with a sample of 149 employees of two Belgian research institutes (age range 22–62 years, 72% female). Measurement agreement was assessed for a diverse range of health indicators related to general health, mental and psychosocial health, health behaviors and prevention with kappa coefficients and intraclass correlation (ICC). The quality of the data collected by both modes was evaluated by quantifying the missing, ‘don’t know’ and inconsistent values and data entry mistakes. Good to very good agreement was found for all categorical indicators with kappa coefficients superior to 0.60, except for two mental and psychosocial health indicators namely the presence of a sleeping disorder and of a depressive disorder (kappa≥0.50). For the continuous indicators high to acceptable agreement was observed with ICC superior to 0.70. Inconsistent answers and data-entry mistakes were only occurring in the paper-and-pencil mode. There were no less missing values in the web-based mode compared to the paper-and-pencil mode. The study supports the idea that web-based modes provide, in general, equal responses to paper-and-pencil modes. However, health indicators based upon factual and objective items tend to have higher measurement agreement than indicators requiring an assessment of personal subjective feelings. A web-based mode greatly facilitates the data-entry process and guides the completing of a questionnaire. However, item non-response was not positively affected.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197434</originId><fingerprint>26193670</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197434</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elise Braekman, Finaba Berete, Rana Charafeddine, Stefaan Demarest, Sabine Drieskens, Lydia Gisle, Geert Molenberghs, Jean Tafforeau, Johan Van der Heyden, Guido Van Hal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Lactococcus lactis&lt;/i&gt; is an ovoid bacterium that forms filaments during planktonic and biofilm lifestyles by uncoupling cell division from cell elongation. In this work, we investigate the role of the leading peptidoglycan synthase PBP2b that is dedicated to cell elongation in ovococci. We show that the localization of a fluorescent derivative of PBP2b remains associated to the septal region and superimposed with structural changes of FtsZ during both vegetative growth and filamentation indicating that PBP2b remains intimately associated to the division machinery during the whole cell cycle. In addition, we show that PBP2b-negative cells of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lactis&lt;/i&gt; are not only defective in peripheral growth; they are also affected in septum positioning. This septation defect does not simply result from the absence of the protein in the cell growth machinery since it is also observed when PBP2b-deficient cells are complemented by a catalytically inactive variant of PBP2b. Finally, we show that round cells resulting from β-lactam treatment are not altered in septation, suggesting that shape elongation as such is not a major determinant for selection of the division site. Altogether, we propose that the specific PBP2b transpeptidase activity at the septum plays an important role for tagging future division sites during &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lactis&lt;/i&gt; cell cycle.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198014</originId><fingerprint>559dbb78</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198014</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Blandine David, Marie-Clémence Duchêne, Gabrielle Laurie Haustenne, Daniel Pérez-Núñez, Marie-Pierre Chapot-Chartier, Xavier De Bolle, Eric Guédon, Pascal Hols, Bernard Hallet&lt;/p&gt;

Regulating membrane potential and synaptic function contributes significantly to the energetic costs of brain signaling, but the relative costs of action potentials (APs) and synaptic transmission during high-frequency firing are unknown. The continuous high-frequency (200-600Hz) electric organ discharge (EOD) of &lt;i&gt;Eigenmannia&lt;/i&gt;, a weakly electric fish, underlies its electrosensing and communication. EODs reflect APs fired by the muscle-derived electrocytes of the electric organ (EO). Cholinergic synapses at the excitable posterior membranes of the elongated electrocytes control AP frequency. Based on whole-fish O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption, ATP demand per EOD-linked AP increases exponentially with AP frequency. Continual EOD-AP generation implies first, that ion homeostatic processes reliably counteract any dissipation of posterior membrane E&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; and second that high frequency synaptic activation is reliably supported. Both of these processes require energy. To facilitate an exploration of the expected energy demands of each, we modify a previous excitability model and include synaptic currents able to drive APs at frequencies as high as 600 Hz. Synaptic stimuli are modeled as pulsatile cation conductance changes, with or without a small (sustained) background conductance. Over the full species range of EOD frequencies (200–600 Hz) we calculate frequency-dependent “Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-entry budgets” for an electrocyte AP as a surrogate for required 3Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/2K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase activity. We find that the cost per AP of maintaining constant-amplitude APs increases nonlinearly with frequency, whereas the cost per AP for synaptic input current is essentially constant. This predicts that Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel density should correlate positively with EOD frequency, whereas AChR density should be the same across fish. Importantly, calculated costs (inferred from Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-entry through Nav and ACh channels) for electrocyte APs as frequencies rise are much less than expected from published whole-fish EOD-linked O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption. For APs at increasingly high frequencies, we suggest that EOD-related costs external to electrocytes (including packaging of synaptic transmitter) substantially exceed the direct cost of electrocyte ion homeostasis.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196508</originId><fingerprint>5517a4b0</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196508</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bela Joos, Michael R.

The ability to arrange thoughts and actions in an appropriate serial order (the problem of serial order) is essential to complex behaviors such as language, reasoning and cognitive planning. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) perform poorly in tasks that rely on the successful rearrangement of working memory representations. We hypothesized that serial ordering is impaired in nondemented patients with mild PD. We recruited 49 patients with mild idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr Scale 1–2.5) and 51 matched healthy adults. Nineteen patients had normal global cognition (PD-NC, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA≥26/30) and thirty patients had mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, 21≤MoCA≤25). All participants underwent three working memory assessments: two experimental tests that require reordering random digits following a particular rule (adaptive digit ordering test and digit span backward test) and a control test that requires maintaining but no reordering (digit span forward test). PD-NC and PD-MCI patients performed significantly worse (with lower test scores and larger ordering costs) than healthy controls in both digit ordering and backward tests, although they performed normally in the forward test. The ordering cost increased as a function of age across groups, indicating an aging-related decline in the ability of serial ordering. However, individual patients’ task performances were not correlated with their severity or duration of motor symptoms, or daily exposure to dopaminergic drugs. These results suggested that serial ordering deficits exist in early stages of PD, prior to subtle changes in global cognition and in parallel with motor symptoms.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197489</originId><fingerprint>6d61d35c</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197489</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinghong Ma, Shaoyang Ma, Haiqiang Zou, Yizhi Zhang, Piu Chan, Zheng Ye&lt;/p&gt;

These results suggested that serial ordering deficits exist in early stages of PD, prior to subtle changes in global cognition and in parallel with motor symptoms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Impaired serial ordering in nondemented patients with mild Parkinson’s disease</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526504400000</updated></item><item><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1636e7c4ace:4b11760:2835af05</id><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37234</link><author><name>Susan_Gerbi@Brown.edu (Susan A Gerbi)</name></author><published>1526515200000</published><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><engagement>3</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37234</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526567029454</crawled><description>Structures known as chromocenters, comprising satellite DNA and proteins such as D1 or HMGA1, help to contain DNA inside the nucleus between cell divisions.</description><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37234</originId><fingerprint>4c996932</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37234</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><visual><url>none</url></visual><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item></keywords><title>Bundling up DNA</title><summary><content>Structures known as chromocenters, comprising satellite DNA and proteins such as D1 or HMGA1, help to contain DNA inside the nucleus between cell divisions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42268:5785ab88</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197058</link><author><name>Kyu Jin Han</name></author><published>1525726800000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197058</canonicalUrl><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kyu Jin Han, Young Hoon Lee&lt;/p&gt;
Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the thickness of retinal layers and association with final visual acuity using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in macular area of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients after a successful macular re-attachment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In retrospective study, a total 24 eyes with macula-off RRD were enrolled. All patients underwent vitrectomy to repair RRD. Outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptor layer (PR), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thicknesses were measured by the Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) SD-OCT with automated segmentation software. The relationship between the thicknesses of each retinal layer and postoperative logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution scale (LogMAR) visual acuity was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;OPL and RPE thicknesses were not significantly different between the retinal detachment eyes and fellow eyes (P = 0.839, 0.999, respectively). The ONL and photoreceptor thickness were significantly thinner in the retinal detachment eyes (P &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.001, respectively). In the univariate regression analysis, preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ONL thickness and photoreceptor thickness showed association with the postoperative BCVA (P = 0.003, &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.024, respectively). In final multiple linear regression model, ONL thickness was the only variable significantly associated with postoperative BCVA (P = 0.044).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Segmented ONL and photoreceptor thickness of retinal detachment eyes were significantly thinner than fellow eyes. Segmental analysis of the retinal layer in macular region may provide valuable information for evaluation RRD. And ONL thickness can be used as a potential biomarker to predict visual outcome after RRD repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197058</originId><fingerprint>a1d2f9a8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197058</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kyu Jin Han, Young Hoon Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Crime and violence causes massive disruptions to the health, survival and development of populations. In South Africa, incredibly high rates of crime and violence are noted. The country also has a very large youth population whose health, survival and development are key to economic growth. Among other efforts to encourage healthy youth development and the promotion of social activities such as sports, youth groups, choirs and so forth. This study examines the relationship between perceived community safety and the uptake of social activities among youth in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Data and methods &lt;p&gt;This paper uses data from the National Youth Lifestyle Survey (2008) with an unweighted sample of 4,391 youth (age12-22 years old). Using chi-square and logistic regression analysis the association between perceived community safety and social activity participation are tested.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that youth participation in social activities in South Africa is high (55% of males and 45% of females). Among males, the most prominent activity is sports (51.8%), while for females there is high participation in choir and singing groups (55.68%). More than 50% of males perceive their communities as risky while less than half of females feel the same. Male youth are more likely to participate in social activities if they perceive their communities as risky (OR = 1.04). Females (OR = 0.83), youth have a negative view of their future (OR = 0.43) are less likely to participate in social activities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There exists an association between youth’s perception of community safety and their participation in social activities. Whether sports and groups are protective or enabling environments for youth from unsafe communities is moot. More in-depth research is needed on why youth participate in these clubs and groups to truly understand the role of social activities in South African societies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197549</originId><fingerprint>b2b960f2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197549</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicole De Wet, Oluwaseyi Somefun, Ndivhuwo Rambau&lt;/p&gt;

VCPA consists of two independent but linkable components: pipeline and tracking database. The pipeline is coded in Workflow Description Language and is fully optimized for the Amazon elastic compute cloud environment. This includes steps for processing raw sequence reads including read alignment, and all the way up to variant calling using GATK. The tracking database allows users to dynamically view the statuses of jobs running and the quality metrics reported by the pipeline. Users can thus monitor the production process and diagnose if any problem arises during the procedure. All quality metrics (&gt;100 collected per processed genome) are stored in the database, thus facilitating users to compare, share and visualize the results. To summarize, VCPA is functional equivalent to the CCDG/TOPMed pipeline. Together with the dockerized database (also available as Amazon Machine Image), users can easily process any WGS/WES data on Amazon cloud with minimal installation. Availability: VCPA is released under the MIT license and is available for academic and nonprofit use for free.

The establishment of agricultural matrices generally involves deforestation, which leads to fragmentation of the remaining forest. This fragmentation can affect forest dynamics both positively and negatively. Since most animal species are affected, certain groups can be used to measure the impact of such fragmentation. This study aimed to measure the impacts of agricultural crops (matrices) on ant communities of adjacent lower montane Atlantic rainforest fragments. We sampled nine forest fragments at locations surrounded by different agricultural matrices, namely: coffee (3 replicates); sugarcane (3); and pasture (3). At each site we installed pitfall traps along a 500 m transect from the interior of the matrix to the interior of the fragment (20 pitfall traps ~25 m apart). Each transect was partitioned into four categories: interior of the matrix; edge of the matrix; edge of the fragment; and interior of the fragment. For each sample site, we measured ant species richness and ant community composition within each transect category. Ant richness and composition differed between fragments and matrices. Each sample location had a specific composition of ants, probably because of the influence of the nature and management of the agricultural matrices. Species composition in the coffee matrix had the highest similarity to its corresponding fragment. The variability in species composition within forest fragments surrounded by pasture was greatest when compared with forest fragments surrounded by sugarcane or, to a lesser extent, coffee. Functional guild composition differed between locations, but the most representative guild was ‘generalist’ both in the agricultural matrices and forest fragments. Our results are important for understanding how agricultural matrices act on ant communities, and also, how these isolated forest fragments could act as an island of biodiversity in an ‘ocean of crops’.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197697</originId><fingerprint>718c265b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197697</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Santana Assis, Iracenir Andrade Dos Santos, Flavio Nunes Ramos, Katty Elena Barrios-Rojas, Jonathan David Majer, Evaldo Ferreira Vilela&lt;/p&gt;

The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in relation to human population densities. Samples from wild red foxes (n = 528) included in the Norwegian monitoring programme on antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food, feed and animals were included. All samples were divided into three different groups based on population density in the municipality where the foxes were hunted. Of the 528 samples included, 108 (20.5%), 328 (62.1%) and 92 (17.4%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. A single faecal swab was collected from each fox. All samples were plated out on a selective medium for &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; for culturing followed by inclusion and susceptibility testing of one randomly selected &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; to assess the overall occurrence of AMR in the Gram-negative bacterial population. Furthermore, the samples were subjected to selective screening for detection of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; displaying resistance towards extended-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. In addition, a subset of samples (n = 387) were subjected to selective culturing to detect &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; resistant to carbapenems and colistin, and enterococci resistant to vancomycin. Of these, 98 (25.3%), 200 (51.7%) and 89 (23.0%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. Overall, the occurrence of AMR in indicator &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; from wild red foxes originating from areas with different human population densities in Norway was low to moderate (8.8%). The total occurrence of AMR was significantly higher; χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1,N = 336) = 6.53, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01 in areas with high population density compared to areas with medium population density. Similarly, the occurrence of fluoroquinolone resistant &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; isolated using selective detection methods was low in areas with low population density and more common in areas with medium or high population density. In conclusion, we found indications that occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in Norway is associated with human population density. Foxes living in urban areas are more likely to be exposed to AMR bacteria and resistance drivers from food waste, garbage, sewage, waste water and consumption of contaminated prey compared to foxes living in remote areas. The homerange of red fox has been shown to be limited thereby the red fox constitutes a good sentinel for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in the environment. Continuous monitoring on the occurrence of AMR in different wild species, ecological niches and geographical areas can facilitate an increased understanding of the environmental burden of AMR in the environment. Such information is needed to further assess the impact for humans, and enables implementation of possible control measures for AMR in humans, animals and the environment in a true “One Health” approach.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198019</originId><fingerprint>f1dd2015</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198019</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Solveig Sølverød Mo, Anne Margrete Urdahl, Knut Madslien, Marianne Sunde, Live L.

Hair growth disorders often carry a major psychological burden. Therefore, more effective human hair growth–modulatory agents urgently need to be developed. Here, we used the hypertrichosis-inducing immunosuppressant, Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a lead compound to identify new hair growth–promoting molecular targets. Through microarray analysis we identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-regulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/β-catenin activity through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collectively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non–immune-inhibitory CsA target; (b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical β-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new promoter of human hair growth. Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through ligands that are already present, this ‘ligand-limited’ therapeutic strategy for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt over-activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0-d2BFNTwPU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1525816154670</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003705</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003705</originId><fingerprint>eed50c14</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/0-d2BFNTwPU/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan J.

We spend a lot of time thinking about proteins in terms of their primary sequence and features of their three-dimensional structure (binding pockets, recognition domains, etc.) And that’s understandable. But it’s always important not to lose sight of the fact that the surfaces of proteins are decorated with all kinds of ornaments that are vital for their function, even if they’re synthetically hard to control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief among those are phosphates, you’d have to say. Kinases, of course, phosphorylate things and phosphatases take those back off (and as is often the case in biology, those two classes of enzymes are rather unbalanced: there are a lot more specific kinases out there, compared to a relatively small number of jack-of-all-trades phosphatases). Phosphorylation state can be a powerful on/off switch on specific protein residues, but it’s worth remembering that proteins can have a whole long list of phosphoryation sites once you get past the heavy-duty ones. The number of kinase inhibitors out there is proof enough that this method of regulating protein function can be taken advantage of, but it’s worth keeping in mind that making specifically phosphorylated proteins can be a painful process if you don’t have a living cell or at least a tame enzyme to do it for you. That’s particularly true if you’re interested in one of the less-common phosphorylation sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have a very different sort of polarity modification, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenylation&quot;&gt;prenylation&lt;/a&gt;. Farnesyl (or geranyl-geranyl) groups are small lipophilic chains that get attached to proteins to modify their function and/or cellular localization. Proteins also get decorated with even longer lipid chains via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitoylation&quot;&gt;palmitoylation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myristoylation&quot;&gt;myristoylation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s believed that these are generally involved in localizing things to membrane sites (as those greasy side chains settle into the lipid membrane). What’s for sure is that these modifications can make proteins rather tricky to work with (as is generally the case when you have a big polar/nonpolar structural separation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that you get to the proteins-modified-with-other-proteins class, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin&quot;&gt;ubiquitination&lt;/a&gt; at the head of that class. Ubiquitin, as the name implies, is all over the place, and proteins get ubiquitinated (at lysine residues) to mark them for degradation, to mark them not to be degraded, to change their localization and interaction networks, and for who knows what else. It’s a huge topic, since there are lots of varieties of ubiquitin attachment, and if you think we’ve got them all figured out you are sadly mistaken. Then there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUMO_protein&quot;&gt;SUMOylation&lt;/a&gt;, another add-a-small-protein process that’s clearly important but which we understand even less. It’s less common than ubiquitination (we think!), but there are several different sorts of SUMO proteins and places that they can be attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m skipping over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification&quot;&gt;several other&lt;/a&gt; post-translational modifications to get to a big class of them that I haven’t mentioned yet: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation&quot;&gt;glycosylations&lt;/a&gt;. Sugar molecules (and chains of them) are stapled on to residues like tyrosine, starting with good old glucose and going on from there. These things can also be linked through amine and sometimes even SH residues, and that is just the beginning. I did my graduate work using carbohydrates as starting materials for organic synthesis, and anyone who’s worked with them will have some appreciation of the complications that are available. With all those open hydroxyls available, carbohydrates have a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside&quot;&gt;linking possibilities&lt;/a&gt; (some more common than others, naturally), and you have the alpha/beta anomeric centers for variety as well. Two naturally occurring amino acids can give you four peptides, but two naturally occurring sugars can give you a whole lot more disaccharides, at least in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modifications are hugely important in proteins and many other biomolecules (including small-molecule natural products), but when I was in grad school, a lot of this was, chemically and biologically speaking, dark matter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK453015/&quot;&gt;A lot of it&lt;/a&gt; still is. Sometimes people would prefer just to ignor that part – even now, you’ll see total syntheses of some natural product as “whateverol aglycon”, that is, minus those pesky sugars. And when it comes to proteins, you almost have to rely on a living cell to glycosylate them properly, because chemically it can be a beast. A lot of chemical glycosylations are variations on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koenigs%E2%80%93Knorr_reaction&quot;&gt;Koenigs-Knorr&lt;/a&gt; reaction, with glycosyl halides, pseudohalides, and other leaving groups, and the number of variations on this is surely beyond counting. Holy cow, are there ever a lot of attempts to make glycosylation a better and more predictable reaction. My old “Lowe’s Laws of the Lab List” had one that went “&lt;em&gt;When there are twenty different ways of running a reaction in the literature, it means that there is no good way to run the reaction&lt;/em&gt;“, and the Koenigs-Knorr was what I had in mind. But it’s true: every time you vary the substrate being glycosylated or mess with the structure of the sugar part in any way, you can expect to see a new mixture of alpha/beta glycosides at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper I linked to so many paragraphs ago is a good shot, though, at taming this stuff for plain glucose-style glycosylation. The authors have a glycosyl fluoride protocol worked out (calcium hydroxide turns out to be a key addition) that seems to give pretty solid results on tyrosines (and phenols in general). What’s really impressive is that it works under aqueous conditions, using an unprotected sugar, and works on native (unprotected) proteins and peptides. It’s not perfect – you still get some glycosylation on other residues (serine, etc.), but it’s certainly the best I’ve ever seen. It would be interesting to see what happens when you try it on a protein with several possible tyrosines or with competing Cys residues, and I get the impression that the authors are heading there next. But even as it stands, this looks like a significantly better option than anything else out there for fast one-step glycosylation without messing around with protecting groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sorts of tools that are available for synthesizing, manipulating, and analyzing proteins and nucleic acids are (in general) just not available for carbohydrates. They either don’t exist anywhere or haven’t been domesticated from their biochemical forms.

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a serious complication during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Currently, the diagnosis of CI-AKI relies on serum creatinine (SCr) that is however affected by several limitations potentially leading to delayed or missed diagnoses. In this study we examined the diagnostic accuracy of a “bedside” measurement of plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) in the early detection of CI-AKI in 97 patients undergoing elective PCI. The overall incidence of CI-AKI was 3%. A significant positive correlation was observed between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI SCr (r = 0.339, p = 0.004) and a significant negative correlation between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI CrCl (r = -0.303, p = 0.010). In patients with post-PCI SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl (median SCr absolute increase), delta NGAL 0–6 hours and 6-hours NGAL values were higher compared with patients with SCr elevation below the defined threshold (p = 0.049 and p = 0.056). The ROC analysis showed that a 6 hours NGAL value &gt; 96 ng/ml significantly predicted an absolute SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl after contrast exposure with sensitivity of 53% and specificity of 74% (AUC 0.819, 95% CI: 0.656 to 0.983, p = 0.005). The use of bedside NGAL assessment may significantly hasten diagnosis and treatment of CI-AKI, with remarkable clinical prognostic consequences.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197833</originId><fingerprint>bf3a02f9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197833</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Annunziata Nusca, Marco Miglionico, Claudio Proscia, Laura Ragni, Massimiliano Carassiti, Francesca Lassandro Pepe, Germano Di Sciascio&lt;/p&gt;

The use of bedside NGAL assessment may significantly hasten diagnosis and treatment of CI-AKI, with remarkable clinical prognostic consequences.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Early prediction of contrast-induced acute kidney injury by a &quot;bedside&quot; assessment of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin during elective percutaneous coronary interventions</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1527109200000</updated></item><item><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163a5aab38d:1587650:3dd877af</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029252?af=R</link><author><name>Gabriel Cabra</name></author><published>1526960634000</published><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1527492817805</crawled><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029252?af=R</originId><fingerprint>66b25433</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029252?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/20&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 20&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>On simulation of local fluxes in molecular junctions</title><unread>True</unread><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1636320fcdf:3602ec3:3dd877af</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04209-5</link><author><name>Lun Cui</name></author><published>1526367600000</published><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>2</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A CRISPRi screen in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; reveals sequence-specific toxicity of dCas9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CRISPRi screen in &amp;lt;i&gt;E. coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; reveals sequence-specific toxicity of dCas9, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04209-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04209-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) is a method for targeted silencing of transcription that requires the coexpression of protein dCas9 and a customized guide RNA.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Point-of-care nerve conduction devices (POCD) have been studied in younger patients and may facilitate screening for polyneuropathy in non-specialized clinical settings. However, performance may be impaired with advanced age owing to age-related changes in nerve conduction. We aimed to evaluate the validity of a POCD as a proxy for standard nerve conduction studies (NCS) in older adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sural nerve amplitude potential (AMP) and sural nerve conduction velocity (CV) was measured in 68 participants with ≥ 50 years T1D duration and 71 controls (from age/sex-matched subgroups) using POCD and NCS protocols. Agreement was determined by the Bland-Altman method, and validity was determined by receiver operating characteristic curves.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;T1D were 53% female, aged 66±8yr and had diabetes duration 54yr[52,58]. Controls were 56%(p = 0.69) female and aged 65±8yr(p = 0.36). Mean AMP&lt;sub&gt;POCD&lt;/sub&gt; and CV&lt;sub&gt;POCD&lt;/sub&gt; for the 139 participants was 7.4±5.8μV and 45.7±11.2m/s and mean AMP&lt;sub&gt;NCS&lt;/sub&gt; and CV&lt;sub&gt;NCS&lt;/sub&gt; was 7.2±6.1μV and 43.3±8.3m/s.

However, whether and how robust DNA repair machinery promotes longevity is elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ATM-centered DNA damage response (DDR) progressively declines with senescence and age, while low dose of chloroquine (CQ) activates ATM, promotes DNA damage clearance, rescues age-related metabolic shift, and prolongs replicative lifespan. Molecularly, ATM phosphorylates SIRT6 deacetylase and thus prevents MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Extra copies of &lt;i&gt;Sirt6 &lt;/i&gt;extend lifespan in &lt;i&gt;Atm-/-&lt;/i&gt; mice, with restored metabolic homeostasis. Moreover, the treatment with CQ remarkably extends lifespan of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, but not the ATM-1 mutants. In a progeria mouse model with low DNA repair capacity, long-term administration of CQ ameliorates premature ageing features and extends lifespan. Thus, our data highlights a pro-longevity role of ATM, for the first time establishing direct causal links between robust DNA repair machinery and longevity, and providing therapeutic strategy for progeria and age-related metabolic diseases.</description><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34836</originId><fingerprint>8ff21a16</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34836</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item></keywords><title>Boosting ATM activity alleviates ageing and extends lifespan in a mouse model of progeria</title><summary><content>DNA damage accumulates with age (Lombard et al., 2005).

Age is a major risk factor for diseases caused by ischemic hypoxia, such as stroke and coronary artery disease. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are the major cells respond to ischemic hypoxia through angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. However, the effect of aging on EPCs and their responses to hypoxia are not well understood. CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs were isolated from healthy volunteers and aged by replicative senescence, which was to passage cells until their doubling time was twice as long as the original cells. Young and aged CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs were exposed to a hypoxic environment (1% oxygen for 48hrs) and their gene expression profiles were evaluated using gene expression array. Gene array results were confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and BALB/c female athymic nude mice hindlimb ischemia model. We identified 115 differentially expressed genes in young CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs, 54 differentially expressed genes in aged CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs, and 25 common genes between normoxia and hypoxia groups. Among them, the expression of solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 1 (SLC2A1) increased the most by hypoxia in young cells. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated the pathways affected by aging and hypoxia most, including genes “response to oxygen levels” in young EPCs and genes involved “chondroitin sulfate metabolic process” in aged cells. Our study results indicate the key factors that contribute to the effects of aging on response to hypoxia in CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs. With the potential applications of EPCs in cardiovascular and other diseases, our study also provides insight on the impact of ex vivo expansion might have on EPCs.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196572</originId><fingerprint>b8ac7bee</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196572</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tzu-Wei Wu, Chun-Chieh Liu, Chung-Lieh Hung, Chih-Hsien Yen, Yih-Jer Wu, Li-Yu Wang, Hung-I Yeh&lt;/p&gt;

A clinically useful prediction algorithm should be accurate, generalizable, be able to integrate diverse data types, and handle sparse data. A clinical predictor based on genomic data needs to be easily interpretable to drive hypothesis-driven research into new treatments. We describe netDx, a novel supervised patient classification framework based on patient similarity networks. netDx meets the above criteria and particularly excels at data integration and model interpretability. As a machine learning method, netDx demonstrates consistently excellent performance in a cancer survival benchmark across four cancer types by integrating up to six genomic and clinical data types. In these tests, netDx has significantly higher average performance than most other machine-learning approaches across most cancer types and its best model outperforms all other methods for two cancer types. In comparison to traditional machine learning-based patient classifiers, netDx results are more interpretable, visualizing the decision boundary in the context of patient similarity space. When patient similarity is defined by pathway-level gene expression, netDx identifies biological pathways important for outcome prediction, as demonstrated in diverse data sets of breast cancer and asthma. Thus, netDx can serve both as a patient classifier and as a tool for discovery of biological features characteristic of disease. We provide a software complete implementation of netDx along with sample files and automation workflows in R.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/084418v4?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>a235e9cc</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/084418v4?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Patient classification has widespread biomedical and clinical applications, including diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response prediction.

We provide a software complete implementation of netDx along with sample files and automation workflows in R.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>netDx: Interpretable patient classification using integrated patient similarity networks [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1632c364878:1616c70:3dd877af</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313932v1?rss=1</link><author><name>Cermak, N.</name></author><published>1525417200000</published><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/04/313932</canonicalUrl><crawled>1525455145080</crawled><description>Simple synthetic bacterial communities are powerful tools for studying microbial ecology and evolution, as they enable rapid iteration between controlled laboratory experiments and theoretical modeling. However, their utility is hampered by the lack of fast, inexpensive, and accurate methods for quantifying bacterial community composition. For instance, while next-generation amplicon sequencing can be very accurate, high costs (&gt;$30 per sample) and turnaround times (&gt;1 month) limit the nature and pace of experiments. Here, we introduce a new approach for quantifying composition in synthetic bacterial communities based on Sanger sequencing. First, for a given community, we PCR-amplify a universal marker gene (here, the 16S rRNA gene), which yields a mixture of amplicons. Second, we sequence this amplicon mixture in a single Sanger sequencing reaction, which produces a &amp;quot;mixed&amp;quot; electropherogram with contributions from each community member. We also sequence each community member&apos;s marker gene individually to generate &amp;quot;individual&amp;quot; electropherograms. Third, we fit the mixed electropherogram as a linear combination of time-warped individual electropherograms, thereby allowing us to estimate the fractional amplicon abundance of each strain within the community. Importantly, our approach accounts for retention-time variability in electrophoretic signals, which is crucial for accurate compositional estimates. Using synthetic communities of marine bacterial isolates, we show that this approach yields accurate and reproducible abundance estimates for two-, four-, and seven-strain bacterial communities. Furthermore, this approach can provide results within one day and costs ~$5 USD per sample. We envision this approach will enable new insights in microbial ecology by increasing the number of samples that can be analyzed and enabling faster iteration between experiments and theory. We have implemented our method in a free and open-source R package called CASEU (&amp;quot;Compositional Analysis by Sanger Electropherogram Unmixing&amp;quot;), available at https://bitbucket.org/DattaManoshi/caseu.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313932v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>a050e664</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313932v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Simple synthetic bacterial communities are powerful tools for studying microbial ecology and evolution, as they enable rapid iteration between controlled laboratory experiments and theoretical modeling.

Most annotations of PPIs mix experimental and computational data. The mix optimizes coverage, but obfuscates the annotation origin. Some resources excel at focusing on reliable experimental data. Here, we focused on new pairs of interacting proteins for several model organisms based solely on sequence-based prediction methods. Results: We extracted reliable experimental data about which proteins interact (binary) for eight diverse model organisms from public databases, namely from Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and for the previously used Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Those data were the base to develop a PPI prediction method for each model organism. The method used evolutionary information through a profile-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). With the resulting eight models, we predicted all possible protein pairs in each organism and made the top predictions available through a web application. Almost all of the PPIs made available were predicted between proteins that have not been observed in any interaction, in particular for less well-studied organisms. Thus, our work complements existing resources and is particularly helpful for designing experiments because of its uniqueness. Experimental annotations and computational predictions are strongly influenced by the fact that some proteins have many partners and others few. To optimize machine learning, the newly methods explicitly ignored such a network-structure and rely either on domain knowledge or sequence-only methods. Our approach is independent of domain-knowledge and leverages evolutionary information.

An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. Methods: We designed mathematical models and fit them to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We used the model to predict the level of immune protection and morbidity for different inoculum doses and to explore what an optimal inoculum dose might be. Results: We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. We find that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity depends on the pathogen and both protection and morbidity do not always increase with increasing inoculum dose. An intermediate inoculum dose can provide the best balance between immune protection and morbidity, though this depends on the specific weighting of protection and morbidity. Conclusions: Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework which combines data and models can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328559v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>7174121</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328559v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Background: Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases.

Conclusions: Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework which combines data and models can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Exploring the impact of inoculum dose on host immunity and morbidity to inform model-based vaccine design [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce942:3dd877af</id><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-q?rss=1</link><author><name>Ash, C.</name></author><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-q?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527183688000</published><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/870.17.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>bdb0ece2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-q?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Anatomy, Morphology, Biomechanics, Evolution</item></keywords><title>Multiple parasites speed host evolution</title><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce952:3dd877af</id><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-a?rss=1</link><author><name>Hines, P.

Infection experiments are critical for understanding wildlife disease dynamics. Although infection experiments are typically designed to reduce complexity, disease outcomes still result from complex interactions between host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Cryptic variation across factors can lead to decreased repeatability of infection experiments within and between research groups and hinder research progress. Furthermore, studies with unexpected results are often relegated to the “file drawer” and potential insights gained from these experimental outcomes are lost. Here, we report unexpected results from an infection experiment studying the response of two differentially-susceptible but related frogs (American Bullfrog &lt;i&gt;Rana catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; and the Mountain yellow-legged frog &lt;i&gt;Rana muscosa&lt;/i&gt;) to the amphibian-killing chytrid fungus (&lt;i&gt;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&lt;/i&gt;, Bd). Despite well-documented differences in susceptibility between species, we found no evidence for antibody-mediated immune response and no Bd-related mortality in either species. Additionally, during the study, the sham-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; control group became unexpectedly Bd-positive. We used a custom genotyping assay to demonstrate that the aberrantly-infected &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; carried a Bd genotype distinct from the inoculation genotype. Thus &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; individuals were acquired with low-intensity infections that could not be detected with qPCR. In the Bd-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; treatment group, the inoculated genotype appeared to out-compete the cryptic infection. Thus, our results provide insight into Bd coinfection dynamics, a phenomenon that is increasingly relevant as different pathogen strains are moved around the globe. Our experiment highlights how unexpected experimental outcomes can serve as both cautionary tales and opportunities to explore unanswered research questions. We use our results as a case study to highlight common sources of anomalous results for infection experiments. We argue that understanding these factors will aid researchers in the design, execution, and interpretation of experiments to understand wildlife disease processes.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196851</originId><fingerprint>54d76600</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196851</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Allison Q.

Brain structure and learning capacities both vary with experience, but the mechanistic link between them is unclear. Here, we investigated whether experience-dependent variability in learning performance can be explained by neuroplasticity in foraging honey bees. The mushroom bodies (MBs) are a brain center necessary for ambiguous olfactory learning tasks such as reversal learning. Using radio frequency identification technology, we assessed the effects of natural variation in foraging activity, and the age when first foraging, on both performance in reversal learning and on synaptic connectivity in the MBs. We found that reversal learning performance improved at foraging onset and could decline with greater foraging experience. If bees started foraging before the normal age, as a result of a stress applied to the colony, the decline in learning performance with foraging experience was more severe. Analyses of brain structure in the same bees showed that the total number of synaptic boutons at the MB input decreased when bees started foraging, and then increased with greater foraging intensity. At foraging onset MB structure is therefore optimized for bees to update learned information, but optimization of MB connectivity deteriorates with foraging effort. In a computational model of the MBs sparser coding of information at the MB input improved reversal learning performance. We propose, therefore, a plausible mechanistic relationship between experience, neuroplasticity, and cognitive performance in a natural and ecological context.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196749</originId><fingerprint>356b887b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196749</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Amélie Cabirol, Alex J.

We show that RSV infection up-regulated hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase expression and increased PGD2 release by cultured human primary airway epithelial cells (AECs). Moreover, PGD2 production was elevated in nasopharyngeal samples from young infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis compared to healthy controls. In a neonatal mouse model of severe viral bronchiolitis, DP2 antagonism decreased viral load, immunopathology, and morbidity and ablated the predisposition for subsequent asthma onset in later life. This protective response was abolished upon dual DP1/DP2 antagonism and replicated with a specific DP1 agonist.

We show that RSV infection up-regulated hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase expression and increased PGD2 release by cultured human primary airway epithelial cells (AECs). Moreover, PGD2 production was elevated in nasopharyngeal samples from young infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis compared to healthy controls. In a neonatal mouse model of severe viral bronchiolitis, DP2 antagonism decreased viral load, immunopathology, and morbidity and ablated the predisposition for subsequent asthma onset in later life. This protective response was abolished upon dual DP1/DP2 antagonism and replicated with a specific DP1 agonist.

That’s how it is in drug research, and how it is in science in general. The problems and questions we’re working on are bigger than any one nationality; we’re tackling these things as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s disquieting to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/584?rss=1&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. That article reports that the (quite nationalist) government in Hungary is causing trouble for universities there, specifically the Central European University, accusing it and some of its faculty members of being in the pay of opponents of the government. It’s especially sad to see the national science funding agency participate in such actions. Hungarian scientists were a profound influence on the 20th century; the country produced a run of mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and chemists that had colleagues at Los Alamos joking that they must be Martians in disguise. But they didn’t get to that point by trying to do only Pure Hungarian Research, because there’s no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than there is Pure American, Pure German, or Pure Chinese Research.A look at what Germany did to its own scientific establishment under the National Socialist government should be all that’s needed as an argument, but apparently not. These things are dangerous fantasies, because talent comes from everywhere (and it often doesn’t conform to any given government’s ideology, either). I have a strong feeling that the current Hungarian government would be denouncing John von Neumann as a secret agent of George Soros were he or his like alive today. And they’re doing their best to make sure that the country never produces another such figure, which is a loss for the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/china-to-roll-back-regulations-for-traditional-medicine-despite-safety-concerns-1.23038&quot;&gt;Here’s another example&lt;/a&gt; of nationalism at work, this time in drug research. The Chinese government is apparently planning to drop requirements for safety and efficacy testing of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapies. Xi Jinping himself is a big advocate, and what more do you need? Students who want to become TCM practitioners no longer need to pass the national medical exam to open their practices. Not only are these preparations getting easy regulatory treatment – the government is making it harder and harder for anyone to express any contrary opinions about them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With strong government support for the alternative medicines industry, Chinese censors have been quick to remove posts from the Internet that question its efficacy. On 23 October, an article on a medical news site that called for closer attention to the risks of aristolochic acid was removed from social media site WeChat. The story had been viewed more than 700,000 times in three days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debate over TCMs has been silenced before in China. Last year, a Beijing think tank — the Development Research Center of the State Council — proposed banning the practice of extracting Asiatic black bear bile, another common ingredient in TCMs. The think tank’s report questioned the remedy’s efficacy and suggested using synthetic alternatives. It was removed from the think tank’s website after the Chinese Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which supports the development of TCM, called it biased and demanded an apology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04886-8&quot;&gt;go to jail&lt;/a&gt; for criticizing this stuff. Now, I think the way that the US regulates (or doesn’t regulate) “dietary supplements” &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/11/04/the_herbal_supplement_industry_is_not_a_very_funny_joke&quot;&gt;is a disgrace&lt;/a&gt;, but this is insanely worse. China has a great many excellent scientists, in a great many fields, and in drug research in particular they’re working on joining the short list of countries who have their own research-based drug industry that can produce new therapies to help patients around the world. But this effort will not be aided by making it easier for the black bear bile industry. I leave aside for another time discussion of how some of these “remedies” are driving animals around the world to extinction, but that’s just another argument for actually seeing if any of these things work (or even cause actual harm instead), and &lt;em&gt;taking them off the market&lt;/em&gt; if they don’t. But the Chinese government has made the cynical calculation that promoting this stuff will pay off politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? There’s a connection between these two examples. Guess what the Hungarian government is interested in promoting? Traditional Chinese medicine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Government spokespeople declined to answer specific questions about CEU, but did address another flash point: the country’s growing embrace of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). On 16 April, Hungary’s University of Szeged signed an agreement with the Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine in Xianyang, China, to bring TCM researchers, medical experts, and lecturers to teach in the region. The University of Pécs in Hungary has had a similar arrangement since 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year, the Hungarian government also announced plans to allocate about €4.5 million ($5.3 million) to build a new institute with a whole floor dedicated to TCM at Semmelweis University, one of the most prestigious medical schools in Hungary. The government says it wants to bridge the gap between Western medicine and Eastern alternatives to improve Hungarian health care, and also strengthen the economic, political, and cultural ties between Hungary and China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would guess that the most important word in that last sentence is “economic”. It’s pretty strange to see the Hungarian government deciding that the honor of Hungary has to be protected by embracing Chinese herbal remedies, but I’m sure that there are plenty of idiotic speeches laying this connection out in soul-eroding detail. No, this sort of thing is bad news. The reason science works is that we ask questions, investigate them to the best of our abilities, and build on the results that we get &lt;em&gt;whether we like them or not&lt;/em&gt;. Wishful thinking doesn’t work so well. The physical world does what it does independent of anyone’s political agenda or nationalist sloganeering, and pretending otherwise is shameful and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><keywords><item>Current Events</item><item>Snake Oil</item></keywords><title>Nationalist Medicine?

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In sub-Saharan Africa foodborne disease and foodborne disease outbreaks are frequently ascribed to poor personal hygiene of street food vendors and food handlers in food establishments.

The reliability of any quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiment can be seriously compromised by variations between samples as well as between PCR runs. This usually result from errors in sample quantification, especially with samples that are obtained from different individuals and tissues and have been collected at various time intervals. Errors also arise from differences in qPCR efficiency between assays performed simultaneously to target multiple genes on the same plate. Consequently, the derived quantitative data for the target genes become distorted. To avoid this grievous error, an endogenous control, with relatively constant transcription levels in the target individual or tissue, is included in the qPCR assay to normalize target gene expression levels in the analysis. Several housekeeping genes (HKGs) have been used as endogenous controls in quantification studies of mRNA transcripts; however, there is no record in the literature of the evaluation of these genes for the tick-borne protozoan parasite, &lt;i&gt;Theileria parva&lt;/i&gt;. Importantly, the expression of these genes should be invariable between different &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; stocks, ideally under different experimental conditions, to gain extensive application in gene expression studies of this parasite. Thus, the expression of several widely used HKGs was evaluated in this study, including the genes encoding β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 28S rRNA, cytochrome b and fructose-2.6-biphosphate aldolase (F6P) proteins. The qPCR analysis revealed that the expression of genes encoding cytochrome b, F6P and GAPDH varied considerably between the two &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; stocks investigated, the cattle-derived &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; Muguga and the buffalo-derived &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; 7014. 28S rRNA and β-actin gene expression was the most stable; thus, these genes were considered suitable candidates to be used as endogenous control genes for mRNA quantification studies in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt;.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196715</originId><fingerprint>db0672b8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196715</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Teboho N.

Pollen analysis is widely used to verify the geographic origin of honeys, but has never been employed in Australia. In this study, we analysed the pollen content of 173 unblended honey samples sourced from most of the commercial honey producing regions in southern Australia. Southern Australian vegetation is dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; (Myrtaceae) forests and, as expected, most Australian honeys are palynologically dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt;, while other important components include Myrtaceae taxa such as &lt;i&gt;Corymbia&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Angophora&lt;/i&gt; and the tribe Leptospermeae; plus Brassicaceae, &lt;i&gt;Echium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Macadamia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acacia&lt;/i&gt;. An important feature of the honeys is the number of Myrtaceae pollen morphotypes per sample, which is generally high (mean = 4.6) compared to honeys produced outside of Australia, including &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys produced in the Mediterranean region, and honeys produced in South America, which has its own rich indigenous Myrtaceae flora. In the latter regions, the number of Myrtaceae morphotypes is apparently generally ≤2. A high number of Myrtaceae morphotypes may be a feasible criterion for authenticating the origin of Australian honeys, since most Australian honey is produced by honey bees mainly working indigenous floral resources. Myrtaceae morphotype diversity is a convenient melissopalynological measure that could be applied even where detailed knowledge of the pollen morphology of the many component genera and species is absent. Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</originId><fingerprint>2af529db</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by J.

A high number of Myrtaceae morphotypes may be a feasible criterion for authenticating the origin of Australian honeys, since most Australian honey is produced by honey bees mainly working indigenous floral resources. Myrtaceae morphotype diversity is a convenient melissopalynological measure that could be applied even where detailed knowledge of the pollen morphology of the many component genera and species is absent. Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Pollen analysis of Australian honey</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526504400000</updated></item><item><engagementRate>0.3</engagementRate><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce966:3dd877af</id><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/844?rss=1</link><author><name>Kupferschmidt, K.</name></author><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/844?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><engagement>13</engagement><published>1527183688000</published><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/844.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>c2a23902</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/844?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Epidemiology, Medicine, Diseases, Virology</item></keywords><title>A call to arms against the other retrovirus</title><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721f:2835af05</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197246</link><author><name>Michael A.

Influenza A virus infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and currently available prevention and treatment methods are suboptimal. In recent years, genome-wide investigations have revealed numerous host factors that are required for influenza to successfully complete its life cycle. However, only a select, small number of influenza strains were evaluated using this platform, and there was considerable variation in the genes identified across different investigations. In an effort to develop a universally efficacious therapeutic strategy with limited potential for the emergence of resistance, this study was performed to investigate the effect of combinatorial RNA interference (RNAi) on inhibiting the replication of diverse influenza A virus subtypes and strains. Candidate genes were selected for targeting based on the results of multiple previous independent genome-wide studies. The effect of single and combinatorial RNAi on the replication of 12 diverse influenza A viruses, including three strains isolated from birds and one strain isolated from seals, was then evaluated in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. After excluding overly toxic siRNA, two siRNA combinations were identified that reduced mean viral replication by greater than 79 percent in all mammalian strains, and greater than 68 percent in all avian strains. Host-directed combinatorial RNAi effectively prevents growth of a broad range of influenza virus strains &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for further development and future &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197246</originId><fingerprint>90d9f16</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197246</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael A.

Studies on &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; would benefit from the introduction of new selectable markers to allow more complex types of experiments to be conducted with this model animal. We established a new antibiotic selection marker for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; transformation based on nourseothricin (NTC) and its resistance-encoding gene, streptothricin-acetyl transferase 2 (&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt;). NTC was able to efficiently prevent worm development at very low concentrations, and the worms expressing &lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; were able to survive on the selection plates without any developmental defects. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and NTC selection, we were able to easily insert a 13-kb expression cassette into a defined locus in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. The structure and spectrum of NTC differs from other antibiotics like hygromycin B and geneticin, making it possible to use NTC alongside them. Indeed, we confirmed NTC-&lt;i&gt;sat2&lt;/i&gt; selection could work with the hygromycin B selection system simultaneously. Thus, the new NTC–&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; system can act as a useful dominant marker for gene transfer and genome editing in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197128</originId><fingerprint>2f1c4bbd</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197128</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hiroyuki Obinata, Asako Sugimoto, Shinsuke Niwa&lt;/p&gt;

Success rates for catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation patients are currently low; however, there is a subset of patients for whom electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins alone is a successful treatment strategy. It is difficult to identify these patients because there are a multitude of factors affecting arrhythmia susceptibility and maintenance, and the individual contributions of these factors are difficult to determine clinically. We hypothesised that the combination of pulmonary vein (PV) electrophysiology and atrial body fibrosis determine driver location and effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We used bilayer biatrial computer models based on patient geometries to investigate the effects of PV properties and atrial fibrosis on arrhythmia inducibility, maintenance mechanisms, and the outcome of PVI. Short PV action potential duration (APD) increased arrhythmia susceptibility, while longer PV APD was found to be protective. Arrhythmia inducibility increased with slower conduction velocity (CV) at the LA/PV junction, but not for cases with homogeneous CV changes or slower CV at the distal PV. Phase singularity (PS) density in the PV region for cases with PV fibrosis was increased. Arrhythmia dynamics depend on both PV properties and fibrosis distribution, varying from meandering rotors to PV reentry (in cases with baseline or long APD), to stable rotors at regions of high fibrosis density. Measurement of fibrosis and PV properties may indicate patient specific susceptibility to AF initiation and maintenance. PV PS density before PVI was higher for cases in which AF terminated or converted to a macroreentry; thus, high PV PS density may indicate likelihood of PVI success.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rn0Tfj7bu6A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006166</link><crawled>1527184669816</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006166</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006166</originId><fingerprint>ceb5f065</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rn0Tfj7bu6A/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Caroline H.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The pathogenic role of the lysophospholipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate and its receptor S1PR2 in lung fibrosis is unknown. We show here that genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; strikingly attenuated lung fibrosis induced by repeated injections of bleomycin in mice. We observed by using &lt;i&gt;S1pr&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;LacZ/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice that S1PR2 was expressed in alveolar macrophages, vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells in the lung and that S1PR2-expressing cells accumulated in the fibrotic legions. Bone marrow chimera experiments suggested that S1PR2 in bone marrow–derived cells contributes to the development of lung fibrosis. Depletion of macrophages greatly attenuated lung fibrosis. Bleomycin administration stimulated the mRNA expression of the profibrotic cytokines IL-13 and IL-4 and the M2 markers including arginase 1, Fizz1/&lt;i&gt;Retnla&lt;/i&gt;, Ccl17 and Ccl24 in cells collected from broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF), and &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; deletion markedly diminished the stimulated expression of these genes. BALF cells from bleomycin–administered wild-type mice showed a marked increase in phosphorylation of STAT6, a transcription factor which is activated downstream of IL-13, compared with saline–administered wild-type mice. Interestingly, in bleomycin–administered &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, STAT6 phosphorylation in BALF cells was substantially diminished compared with wild-type mice. Finally, pharmacological S1PR2 blockade in &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice alleviated bleomycin–induced lung fibrosis. Thus, S1PR2 facilitates lung fibrosis through the mechanisms involving augmentation of IL-13 expression and its signaling in BALF cells, and represents a novel target for treating lung fibrosis.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197604</originId><fingerprint>33641c1d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197604</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Juanjuan Zhao, Yasuo Okamoto, Yuya Asano, Kazuhiro Ishimaru, Sho Aki, Kazuaki Yoshioka, Noriko Takuwa, Takashi Wada, Yutaka Inagaki, Chiaki Takahashi, Takumi Nishiuchi, Yoh Takuwa&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, pharmacological S1PR2 blockade in &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice alleviated bleomycin–induced lung fibrosis. Thus, S1PR2 facilitates lung fibrosis through the mechanisms involving augmentation of IL-13 expression and its signaling in BALF cells, and represents a novel target for treating lung fibrosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-2 facilitates pulmonary fibrosis through potentiating IL-13 pathway in macrophages</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526936400000</updated></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1635df5d4fa:2dd49ca:3dd877af</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04322-5</link><author><name>Manuel Rodrigues</name></author><published>1526281200000</published><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outlier response to anti-PD1 in uveal melanoma reveals germline &lt;i&gt;MBD4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in hypermutated tumors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlier response to anti-PD1 in uveal melanoma reveals germline &amp;lt;i&gt;MBD4&amp;lt;/i&gt; mutations in hypermutated tumors, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04322-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04322-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hypermutated tumors respond more favorably to checkpoint inhibitor-based immune therapy.

Isomaltodextrin (IMD) is a novel dietary fiber-like polysaccharide: a type of α-glucan produced from starch using enzymes derived from microorganisms. The results of cohort studies show that dietary fiber can prevent cardiovascular disorders caused by lifestyle-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome. Inhibition of excess fat absorption by dietary fiber is known to be one of the mechanisms, and it is also known that the actions of dietary fiber vary depending on factors such as its structure or origin. Thus, we investigated the inhibitory actions of IMD on fat absorption, and analyzed its mechanism of action. In rats, the absorption of fat given by gavage was significantly lower at 1, 2, and 6 hours after IMD administration than after vehicle administration. In humans, IMD was associated with a lesser increase in blood triglycerides in subjects whose blood triglycerides were otherwise apt to rise. We also found by in vitro emulsion studies that IMD, which had no effect on digestive enzyme activity or emulsion formation, stabilized the micro size micelle by inducing enlarged micelle particle size and increased zeta potential. In conclusion, the mechanism of inhibition of fat absorption by IMD may be a delay in micelle particles accessing the intestinal epithelium through changes in the surface structure and the physical properties of the micelle particles.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196802</originId><fingerprint>c77a2e72</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196802</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryodai Takagaki, Yuki Ishida, Tsuyoshi Sadakiyo, Yoshifumi Taniguchi, Takeo Sakurai, Hitoshi Mitsuzumi, Hikaru Watanabe, Shigeharu Fukuda, Shimpei Ushio&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings suggest that aneuploidy screening using BCCM combined with BF could potentially serve as a novel NIPGS approach for use in human IVF.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Evaluation of a novel non-invasive preimplantation genetic screening approach</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525986000000</updated></item><item><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_1632dc4f8d4:3b05f:abeb7260</id><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00255</link><author><name>Barbora Krausova, Barbora Slavikova, Michaela Nekardova, Pavla Hubalkova, Vojtech Vyklicky, Hana Chodounska, Ladislav Vyklicky, Eva Kudova</name></author><published>1525406400000</published><origin><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00255/20180504/images/medium/jm-2018-00255b_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00255&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Unpasteurized dairy products are known to occasionally harbor &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and have been implicated in recent listeriosis outbreaks and numerous sporadic cases of listeriosis. However, the diversity and virulence profiles of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from these products have not been fully described. Here we report a genomic analysis of 121 &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from milk, milk filters, and milking equipment collected from bovine dairy farms in 19 states over a 12-year period. In a multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) analysis, 59 Virulence Types (VT) were identified, of which 25% were Epidemic Clones I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, or X, and 31 were novel VT. In a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis, 60 Sequence Types (ST) of 56 Clonal Complexes (CC) were identified. Within lineage I, CC5 and CC1 were among the most abundant, and within lineage II, CC7 and CC37 were the most abundant. Multiple CCs previously associated with central nervous system and maternal-neonatal infections were identified. A genomic analysis identified variable distribution of virulence markers, &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; pathogenicity islands (LIPI) -1, -3, and -4, and stress survival island-1 (SSI-1). Of these, 14 virulence markers, including LIPI-3 and -4 were more frequently detected in one lineage (I or II) than the other. LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks.

However, the actual state of the body of bioinformatics software remains largely unknown. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the state of source code in the bioinformatics community, specifically looking at relationships between code properties, development activity, developer communities, and software impact. To investigate these issues, we curated a list of 1,720 bioinformatics repositories on GitHub through their mention in peer-reviewed bioinformatics articles. Additionally, we included 23 high-profile repositories identified by their popularity in an online bioinformatics forum. We analyzed repository metadata, source code, development activity, and team dynamics using data made available publicly through the GitHub API, as well as article metadata. We found key relationships within our dataset, including: certain scientific topics are associated with more active code development and higher community interest in the repository; most of the code in the main dataset is written in dynamically typed languages, while most of the code in the high-profile set is statically typed; developer team size is associated with community engagement and high-profile repositories have larger teams; the proportion of female contributors decreases for high-profile repositories and with seniority level in author lists; and, multiple measures of project impact are associated with the simple variable of whether the code was modified at all after paper publication.

However, the actual state of the body of bioinformatics software remains largely unknown. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the state of source code in the bioinformatics community, specifically looking at relationships between code properties, development activity, developer communities, and software impact. To investigate these issues, we curated a list of 1,720 bioinformatics repositories on GitHub through their mention in peer-reviewed bioinformatics articles. Additionally, we included 23 high-profile repositories identified by their popularity in an online bioinformatics forum. We analyzed repository metadata, source code, development activity, and team dynamics using data made available publicly through the GitHub API, as well as article metadata. We found key relationships within our dataset, including: certain scientific topics are associated with more active code development and higher community interest in the repository; most of the code in the main dataset is written in dynamically typed languages, while most of the code in the high-profile set is statically typed; developer team size is associated with community engagement and high-profile repositories have larger teams; the proportion of female contributors decreases for high-profile repositories and with seniority level in author lists; and, multiple measures of project impact are associated with the simple variable of whether the code was modified at all after paper publication. In addition to providing the first large-scale analysis of bioinformatics code to our knowledge, our work will enable future analysis through publicly available data, code, and methods.

Hybrid triploid loaches (&lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt;) were generated from natural tetraploid and diploid loaches. We studied the gonads of parents and offspring from direct and reciprocal crosses through histological and transcriptome analyses. The triploid offspring had inferior ability to form sperm and egg cells compared with diploid forms. After sequencing the transcriptomes, 655,109,158 clean reads were obtained, and 62,821 unigenes and 178,962 transcripts were assembled. Of these unigenes, 23,189 were annotated in the GO database, 18,525 in the KEGG database and 24,661 in the KOG database. 36 fertility-related genes were found to be differentially expressed between the direct cross (2n × 4n) progenies and their parents, while 53 fertility-related genes between the reciprocal cross (4n × 2n) progenies and their parents. Following protein-protein interaction network analyses, 54 differentially expressed genes, including &lt;i&gt;PLCB4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cyp17a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pla2g4d&lt;/i&gt;, were mined, yielding candidate genes involved in the poor fertility of hybrid triploid loaches. This is the first report of transcriptomes of gonads of hybrid triploid loaches and their parents, offering a substantial contribution to sequence resources for this species and providing a deep insight into the molecular mechanism controlling the fertility of hybrid triploid fish.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198179</originId><fingerprint>d593552c</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198179</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by He Zhou, Qi-Zheng Xu, Rui Zhang, Zi-Xin Zhuang, Yin-Qiang Ma, Wei Wang, Tian-Yu Ma, Yi Sui, Yang Liu, Xiaojuan Cao&lt;/p&gt;

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are one of the important factors in controlling gene expression and elucidation of their roles has been attracting great interest. We have developed an improved method for analyzing a large variety of mutant CRE sequences in a simple and high-throughput manner. In our approach, mutant CREs with unique barcode sequences were obtained by biased randomization in a single PCR amplification. The original T7 promoter sequence was randomized by biased randomization, and the target number of base substitutions was set to be within the range of 0 to 5. The DNA library and subsequent transcribed RNA library were sequenced by next generation sequencers (NGS) to quantify transcriptional activity of each mutant. We succeeded in producing a randomized T7 promoter library with high coverage rate at each target number of base substitutions. In a single NGS analysis, we quantified the transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants. We confirmed that the bases from −9 to −7 play an important role in the transcriptional activity of the T7 promoter. This information coincides with the previous researches and demonstrated the validity of our methodology. Furthermore, using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; transcription/translation system, we found that transcriptional activities of these T7 variants were well correlated with the resultant protein abundance. We demonstrate that our method enables simple and high-throughput analysis of the effects of various CRE mutations on transcriptional regulation.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196905</originId><fingerprint>5f6e05bc</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196905</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Komura, Wataru Aoki, Keisuke Motone, Atsushi Satomura, Mitsuyoshi Ueda&lt;/p&gt;

Few studies have estimated the economic burden of chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers) attributable to unhealthy eating. In this study, we estimated the economic burden of chronic disease attributable to not meeting Canadian food recommendations. We first obtained chronic disease risk estimates for intakes of both protective (1. vegetables; 2. fruit; 3. whole grains; 4. milk; 5. nuts and seeds) and harmful (6. processed meat; 7. red meat; 8. sugar-sweetened beverages) foods from the Global Burden of Disease Study, and food intakes from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey 24-hour dietary recalls (n = 33,932 respondents). We then calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs) for all relevant food-chronic disease combinations by age and sex groups. These PAFs were then mathematically combined for each disease for each age and sex group. We then estimated attributable costs by multiplying these combined PAFs with estimated 2014 annual direct health care (hospital, drug, physician) and indirect (human capital approach) costs for each disease. We found that not meeting recommendations for the eight foods was responsible for CAD$13.8 billion/year (direct health care: CAD$5.1 billion, indirect: CAD$8.7 billion). Nuts and seeds and whole grains were the top cost contributors rather than vegetables and fruit. Our findings suggest that unhealthy eating constitutes a tremendous economic burden to Canada that is similar in magnitude to the burden of smoking and larger than that of physical inactivity which were estimated using similar approaches. A status quo in promotion of healthy eating will allow this burden to continue. Interventions to reduce the health and economic burden of unhealthy eating in Canada may be more effective if they are broad in focus and include promotion of nuts and seeds and whole grains along with vegetables and fruit rather than have a narrow focus such as primarily on vegetables and fruit.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196333</originId><fingerprint>5d98e56a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196333</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica R.

Particle separation in microfluidic devices is a common problematic for sample preparation in biology. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is efficiently implemented as a size-based fractionation technique to separate two populations of particles around a specific size. However, real biological samples contain components of many different sizes and a single DLD separation step is not sufficient to purify these complex samples. When connecting several DLD modules in series, pressure balancing at the DLD outlets of each step becomes critical to ensure an optimal separation efficiency. A generic microfluidic platform is presented in this paper to optimize pressure balancing, when DLD separation is connected either to another DLD module or to a different microfluidic function. This is made possible by generating droplets at T-junctions connected to the DLD outlets.

Particle separation in microfluidic devices is a common problematic for sample preparation in biology. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is efficiently implemented as a size-based fractionation technique to separate two populations of particles around a specific size. However, real biological samples contain components of many different sizes and a single DLD separation step is not sufficient to purify these complex samples. When connecting several DLD modules in series, pressure balancing at the DLD outlets of each step becomes critical to ensure an optimal separation efficiency. A generic microfluidic platform is presented in this paper to optimize pressure balancing, when DLD separation is connected either to another DLD module or to a different microfluidic function. This is made possible by generating droplets at T-junctions connected to the DLD outlets. Droplets act as pressure controllers, which perform at the same time the encapsulation of DLD sorted particles and the balance of output pressures. The optimized pressures to apply on DLD modules and on T-junctions are determined by a general model that ensures the equilibrium of the entire platform. The proposed separation platform is completely modular and reconfigurable since the same predictive model applies to any cascaded DLD modules of the droplet-based cartridge.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Purification of complex samples: Implementation of a modular and reconfigurable droplet-based microfluidic platform with cascaded deterministic lateral displacement separation modules</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526504400000</updated></item><item><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1631cf1c4b3:26b9588:11c251fd</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022389?af=R</link><author><name>Wentao Li</name></author><published>1525066441000</published><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1525198996659</crawled><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022389?af=R</originId><fingerprint>b1c4f62a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022389?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Free energy study of H2O, N2O5, SO2, and O3 gas sorption by water droplets/slabs</title><unread>True</unread><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16396969152:286e48:7cfe07d6</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26387-4</link><author><name>Vinod Kumar</name></author><published>1527231600000</published><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Development and validation of a LC-MS/MS assay for pharmacokinetic studies of complement C5a receptor antagonists PMX53 and PMX205 in mice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development and validation of a LC-MS/MS assay for pharmacokinetic studies of complement C5a receptor antagonists PMX53 and PMX205 in mice, Published online: 25 May 2018;

Bacteria belonging to the genus &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; have been frequently found in association with a wide variety of marine eukaryotic invertebrate hosts, indicative of their versatile and symbiotic lifestyle. A recent comparison of the sponge-associated &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; genomes has shed light on the mechanisms influencing a successful symbiotic association with sponges. In contrast, the genomic architecture of &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; bacteria associated with other marine hosts has received less attention. Here, we performed genus-wide comparative analyses of 18 &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; isolated from sponges, coral, tunicates, flatworm, and seawater. The analyses revealed a certain degree of commonality among the majority of sponge- and coral-associated bacteria.

This implementation generates results that agree with consensus output on a publicly-available match algorithm cross-validation dataset.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>GRIMM: GRaph IMputation and Matching for HLA Genotypes [CONFIRMATORY RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1636320fcdf:3602ec1:3dd877af</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04268-8</link><author><name>Erhan Genç</name></author><published>1526367600000</published><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>375</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diffusion markers of dendritic density and arborization in gray matter predict differences in intelligence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diffusion markers of dendritic density and arborization in gray matter predict differences in intelligence, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04268-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04268-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Previous studies suggest that individual differences in intelligence correlate with circuit complexity and dendritic arborization in the brain.

The purple sea urchin, &lt;i&gt;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&lt;/i&gt;, has a complex and robust immune system that is mediated by a number of multi-gene families including the &lt;i&gt;SpTransformer&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;SpTrf&lt;/i&gt;) gene family (formerly &lt;i&gt;Sp185/333&lt;/i&gt;). In response to immune challenge from bacteria and various pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the &lt;i&gt;SpTrf&lt;/i&gt; genes are up-regulated in sea urchin phagocytes and express a diverse array of SpTrf proteins. We show here that SpTrf proteins from coelomocytes and isolated by nickel affinity (cNi-SpTrf) bind to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and to Baker’s yeast, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, with saturable kinetics and specificity. cNi-SpTrf opsonization of the marine bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Vibrio diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt;, augments phagocytosis, however, opsonization by the recombinant protein, rSpTrf-E1, does not. Binding by cNi-SpTrf proteins retards growth rates significantly for several species of bacteria. SpTrf proteins, previously thought to be strictly membrane-associated, are secreted from phagocytes in short term cultures and bind &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt; that are located both outside of and within phagocytes. Our results demonstrate anti-microbial activities of native SpTrf proteins and suggest variable functions among different SpTrf isoforms. Multiple isoforms may act synergistically to detect a wide array of pathogens and provide flexible and efficient host immunity.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196890</originId><fingerprint>4798f1f9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196890</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hung-Yen Chou, Cheng Man Lun, L.

Medi-Cal pricing data was from the Workman’s Compensation Insurance System (WCIS). Average Wholesale Prices (AWP), Wholesale Acquisition Costs (WAC), Direct Prices (DP), Federal Upper Limit (FUL) prices, and National Average Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC) were from Medi-Span. We matched National Drug Codes (NDCs), pricing dates, and drug quantity for comparisons. We report pharmacy-dispensed (PD) claims frequency, reimbursement matching rate, and paid costs by CAWCS as the reference price against all alternative price benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 12,529,977 CAWCS claims for pharmaceutical products 11.6% (1,462,814) were for PD drugs. Prescription drug cost for CAWCS was over $152M; $63.9M, $47.9M, and $40.6M in 2011–2013. Ninety seven percent of these CAWCS PD claims had a Medi-Cal price. Alternative mechanisms provided a price for fewer claims; NADAC 94.23%, AWP 90.94%, FUL 73.11%, WAC 66.98%, and DP 14.33%. Among CAWCS drugs with no Medi-Cal price in PD claims, AWP, WAC, NADAC, DP, and FUL provided prices for 96.7%, 63.14%, 24.82%, 20.83%, and 15.08% of claims. Overall CAWCS paid 100.52% of Medi-Cal, 60% of AWP, 97% of WAC, 309.53% of FUL, 103.83% of DP, and 136.27% of NADAC.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CAWCS current Medi-Cal fee-schedule price list for PD drugs is more complete than all alternative fee-schedules. However, all reimbursement approaches would require combinations of pricing benchmarks. We suggest keeping primary reimbursement at 100% of Medi-Cal and for drugs without a primary Medi-Cal price calculating the maximum fee as 60% of AWP and then 97% of WAC. Alternatively, we suggest using NADAC as a primary fee-schedule followed by either 60% AWP and 97% WAC or AWP-40% for drugs with no NADAC price. Fee-schedules may not offer the best price and a formulary approach may provide more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197449</originId><fingerprint>86d77f6</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197449</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Leslie Wilson, Fatema A.

Our aims were to quantify and map the plant sub regions of the the Caatinga, that covers 844,453 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is the largest block of seasonally dry forest in South America. We performed spatial analyses of the largest dataset of woody plant distributions in this region assembled to date (of 2,666 shrub and tree species; 260 localities), compared these distributions with the current phytogeographic regionalizations, and investigated the potential environmental drivers of the floristic patterns in these sub regions. Phytogeographical regions were identified using quantitative analyses of species turnover calculated as Simpson dissimilarity index. We applied an interpolation method to map NMDS axes of compositional variation over the entire extent of the Caatinga, and then classified the compositional dissimilarity according to the number of biogeographical sub regions identified a priori using k-means analysis. We used multinomial logistic regression models to investigate the influence of contemporary climatic productivity, topographic complexity, soil characteristics, climate stability since the last glacial maximum, and the human footprint in explaining the identified sub regions. We identified nine spatially cohesive biogeographical sub regions. Current productivity, as indicated by an aridity index, was the only explanatory variable retained in the best model, explaining nearly half of the floristic variability between sub regions. The highest rates of endemism within the Caatinga were in the Core and Periphery Chapada Diamantina sub regions. Our findings suggest that the topographic complexity, soil variation, and human footprint in the Caatinga act on woody plant distributions at local scales and not as determinants of broad floristic patterns. The lack of effect of climatic stability since the last glacial maximum probably results from the fact that a single measure of climatic stability does not adequately capture the highly dynamic climatic shifts the region suffered during the Pleistocene. There was limited overlap between our results and previous Caatinga classifications.</description><crawled>1524850743729</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196130</originId><fingerprint>d2f705ed</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196130</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Augusto C.

To determine the molecular underpinnings of the disease risk of the heterogeneous GlycA signal, we used machine learning to build imputation models for GlycA&apos;s constituent glycoproteins, then estimated glycoprotein levels in 11,861 adults across two population-based cohorts with long-term follow-up. While alpha-1- acid glycoprotein had the strongest correlation with GlycA, our analysis revealed that alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) was the most predictive of morbidity and mortality for the widest range of diseases, including heart failure (HR=1.60 per s.d., P=1x10-10), influenza and pneumonia (HR=1.37, P=6x10-10), and liver diseases (HR=1.81, P=1x10-6). Despite emerging evidence of AAT&apos;s role in suppressing inflammation, transcriptional analyses revealed elevated expression of diverse inflammatory immune pathways with elevated AAT levels, suggesting AAT is elevating to compensate for low-grade chronic inflammation. This study clarifies the molecular underpinnings of the GlycA biomarker and its associated disease risk, and indicates a previously unrecognised association between elevated AAT and severe disease onset and mortality.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/309138v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>3935c508</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/309138v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Integration of electronic health records with systems-level biomolecular data has led to the discovery that GlycA, a complex nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy biomarker, predicts long-term risk of disease onset and death from myriad causes.

The response of each gene to changes in TF activity is generally assumed to be encoded in the promoter. Here we show that, even when the promoter itself remains constant, each gene has a unique TF dose response curve. Many genes have an intrinsic ability to either buffer or amplify the effects of high promoter activity. We present a coupled mathematical model and experimental system for quantifying this property. Promoter activity buffering can be encoded by sequences in both the open reading frame and 3UTR and can be implemented by both autoregulatory feedback loops and by titration of limiting trans regulators. We show experimentally that promoter activity buffering insulates cells from fitness defects due to misexpression. The response of genes to changes in [TF] is encoded by sequences outside of the promoter, and this effect can either insulate or amplify the effects of aneuploidy and misregulation on organismal fitness.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215186v3?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>858763ee</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215186v3?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Cells regulate gene expression by changing the concentration and activity of transcription factors (TFs).

key technology to a truly sustainable hydrogen-based energy economy. Synthetic
chemists have intuitively tried to enhance photocatalytic activity by tuning
the length of π-conjugated domains of their semiconducting polymers, but the
increasing flexibility and hydrophobicity of ever-larger organic building
blocks leads to adverse effects such as structural collapse and inaccessible
catalytic sites. To reach the ideal optical bandgap of ~2.3 eV, we
synthesised a library of eight sulphur and nitrogen containing porous polymers
(SNPs) with similar geometries but with optical bandgaps ranging from 2.07 to
2.60 eV using Stille coupling. These polymers combine π-conjugated
electron-withdrawing triazine- (C3N3) and electron
donating, sulphur-containing moieties as covalently-bonded donor-acceptor frameworks
with permanent porosity. The remarkable optical properties of SNPs enable
fluorescence on-off sensing of volatile organic compounds and illustrate
intrinsic charge-transfer effects. Moreover, obtained polymers effectively
evolve H2 gas from water under visible light irradiation with
hydrogen evolution rates up to 3158 µmol h-1 g-1 and high apparent
quantum efficiency which is the highest value obtained for microporous
organic polymers to-date. The design principles demonstrated here are
transferable to a new field of high-performance polymer photocatalysts based on
efficient donor-acceptor dyads.</description><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Exploring_the_Goldilocks_Zone_of_Semiconducting_Polymer_Photocatalysts_via_Donor-Acceptor_Interactions/6210110</originId><fingerprint>73470b39</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Exploring_the_Goldilocks_Zone_of_Semiconducting_Polymer_Photocatalysts_via_Donor-Acceptor_Interactions/6210110</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Exploring the “Goldilocks Zone” of Semiconducting Polymer Photocatalysts via Donor-Acceptor Interactions</title><summary><content>Water splitting using polymer photocatalysts is a

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the detrimental effects of intramedullary reaming used in conventional TKA for distal femur cutting are of concern. Avoiding intramedullary reaming with the use of computer-assisted navigation TKA can not only provide superior prosthetic alignment, but also mitigate perioperative blood loss and the dissipation of marrow emboli. We quantified local and systemic concentrations of inflammation markers for both techniques. Forty-four participants undergoing computer-assisted navigation and 53 receiving conventional TKA for advanced knee OA were recruited between 2013/02/08 and 2015/12/09. Blood samples were collected from all participants at baseline then again at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed by ELISA for interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1); these markers were also measured in Hemovac drain fluid collected at 24 and 72 hours. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β1(unit for all markers: pg/mL) were increased from baseline by smaller increments in the navigation TKA cohort compared with the conventional TKA group at 24 hours (17.06 vs 29.39, p = 0.02; 0.51 vs 0.83, p = 0.16; –0.04 vs 0.36, p &amp;lt; 0.01 and –48.18 vs 63.24, p&amp;lt; 0.01, respectively) and at 72 hours (12.27 vs 16.87, p = 0.01; –0.40 vs 0.48, p &amp;lt; 0.01; 0.58 vs 0.98, p = 0.07 and –55.16 vs 63.71, p &amp;lt; 0.01, respectively). IL-10 levels in drainage fluids collected 24 hours after TKA were also significantly lower in the navigation group versus the conventional TKA group (8.55 vs 12.32, p &amp;lt; 0.01). According to our evidence, the merits of computer-assisted navigation TKA are augmented by low levels of inflammation markers.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197097</originId><fingerprint>cdd4764d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197097</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shu-Jui Kuo, Horng-Chaung Hsu, Ching-Jen Wang, Ka-Kit Siu, Ya-Hung Hsu, Jih-Yang Ko, Chih-Hsin Tang&lt;/p&gt;

Exosomes are endosome-derived membrane vesicles that contain proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The exosomal transcriptome mediates intercellular communication, and represents an understudied reservoir of novel biomarkers for human diseases. Next-generation sequencing enables complex quantitative characterization of exosomal RNAs from diverse sources. However, detailed protocols describing exosome purification for preparation of exosomal RNA-sequence (RNA-Seq) libraries are lacking. Here we compared methods for isolation of exosomes and extraction of exosomal RNA from human cell-free serum, as well as strategies for attaining equal representation of samples within pooled RNA-Seq libraries. We compared commercial precipitation with ultracentrifugation for exosome purification and confirmed the presence of exosomes &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; both transmission electron microscopy and immunoblotting. Exosomal RNA extraction was compared using four different RNA purification methods. We determined the minimal starting volume of serum required for exosome preparation and showed that high quality exosomal RNA can be isolated from sera stored for over a decade. Finally, RNA-Seq libraries were successfully prepared with exosomal RNAs extracted from human cell-free serum, cataloguing both coding and non-coding exosomal transcripts. This method provides researchers with strategic options to prepare RNA-Seq libraries and compare RNA-Seq data quantitatively from minimal volumes of fresh and archival human cell-free serum for disease biomarker discovery.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196913</originId><fingerprint>d4c62ae4</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196913</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emily N.

Multifractal analysis offers a number of advantages to measure spatial economic segregation and inequality, as it is free of categories and boundaries definition problems and is insensitive to some shape-preserving changes in the variable distribution. We use two datasets describing Kyoto land prices in 1912 and 2012 and derive city models from this data to show that multifractal analysis is suitable to describe the heterogeneity of land prices. We found in particular a sharp decrease in multifractality, characteristic of homogenisation, between older Kyoto and present Kyoto, and similarities both between present Kyoto and present London, and between Kyoto and Manhattan as they were a century ago. In addition, we enlighten the preponderance of spatial distribution over variable distribution in shaping the multifractal spectrum. The results were tested against the classical segregation and inequality indicators, and found to offer an improvement over those.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196737</originId><fingerprint>d5af3a7f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196737</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hadrien Salat, Roberto Murcio, Keiji Yano, Elsa Arcaute&lt;/p&gt;

The vertebrate neuroepithelium is composed of elongated progenitors whose reciprocal attachments ensure the continuity of the ventricular wall. As progenitors commit to differentiation, they translocate their nucleus basally and eventually withdraw their apical endfoot from the ventricular surface. However, the mechanisms allowing this delamination process to take place while preserving the integrity of the neuroepithelial tissue are still unclear. Here, we show that Notch signaling, which is classically associated with an undifferentiated state, remains active in prospective neurons until they delaminate. During this transition period, prospective neurons rapidly reduce their apical surface and only later down-regulate N-Cadherin levels. Upon Notch blockade, nascent neurons disassemble their junctions but fail to reduce their apical surface. This disrupted sequence weakens the junctional network and eventually leads to breaches in the ventricular wall. We also provide evidence that the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) promotes differentiation by reducing Notch signaling through a &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition mechanism. However, during the delamination process, the ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1) transiently blocks this &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition and sustains Notch activity to defer differentiation. We propose that the fine-tuned balance between Notch &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-activation and &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition allows neuroepithelial cells to seamlessly delaminate from the ventricular wall as they commit to differentiation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OBYDT1hFD-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004162</link><crawled>1525111333970</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004162</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004162</originId><fingerprint>f39f2dd</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/OBYDT1hFD-8/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chooyoung Baek, Lucy Freem, Rosette Goïame, Helen Sang, Xavier Morin, Samuel Tozer&lt;/p&gt;

However, the mechanisms allowing this delamination process to take place while preserving the integrity of the neuroepithelial tissue are still unclear. Here, we show that Notch signaling, which is classically associated with an undifferentiated state, remains active in prospective neurons until they delaminate. During this transition period, prospective neurons rapidly reduce their apical surface and only later down-regulate N-Cadherin levels. Upon Notch blockade, nascent neurons disassemble their junctions but fail to reduce their apical surface. This disrupted sequence weakens the junctional network and eventually leads to breaches in the ventricular wall. We also provide evidence that the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) promotes differentiation by reducing Notch signaling through a &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition mechanism. However, during the delamination process, the ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1) transiently blocks this &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition and sustains Notch activity to defer differentiation. We propose that the fine-tuned balance between Notch &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-activation and &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition allows neuroepithelial cells to seamlessly delaminate from the ventricular wall as they commit to differentiation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OBYDT1hFD-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Mib1 prevents Notch &amp;lt;i&gt;Cis&amp;lt;/i&gt;-inhibition to defer differentiation and preserve neuroepithelial integrity during neural delamination</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525122000000</updated></item><item><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_163184a4753:2a43a:c2c34441</id><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03476</link><author><name>Sijia Peng, Wenjuan Wang, Chunlai Chen</name></author><published>1525060800000</published><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b03476/20180430/images/medium/jp-2018-03476r_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03476&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values represent a widely used, but pervasively misunderstood and fiercely contested method of scientific inference. Display items, such as figures and tables, often containing the main results, are an important source of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. We conducted a survey comparing the overall use of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and the occurrence of significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items of a sample of articles in the three top multidisciplinary journals (Nature, Science, PNAS) in 2017 and, respectively, in 1997. We also examined the reporting of multiplicity corrections and its potential influence on the proportion of statistically significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. Our findings demonstrated substantial and growing reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items, with increases of 2.5 to 14.5 times in 2017 compared to 1997. The overwhelming majority of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values (94%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 92% to 96%) were statistically significant. Methods to adjust for multiplicity were almost non-existent in 1997, but reported in many articles relying on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in 2017 (Nature 68%, Science 48%, PNAS 38%). In their absence, almost all reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant (98%, 95% CI 96% to 99%). Conversely, when any multiplicity corrections were described, 88% (95% CI 82% to 93%) of reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant. Use of Bayesian methods was scant (2.5%) and rarely (0.7%) articles relied exclusively on Bayesian statistics. Overall, wider appreciation of the need for multiplicity corrections is a welcome evolution, but the rapid growth of reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and implausibly high rates of reported statistical significance are worrisome.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197440</originId><fingerprint>3fc0005a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197440</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ioana Alina Cristea, John P.

Calcium is an important second messenger in plants that is released into the cytosol early after recognition of various environmental stimuli. Decoding of such calcium signals by calcium sensors is the key for the plant to react appropriately to each stimulus. Several members of Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) act as calcium sensors and some are known to mediate both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we study the role of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; CML9 in different stress responses. CML9 was reported earlier as defense regulator against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast to salicylic acid-mediated defense against biotrophic pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;syringae&lt;/i&gt;, defenses against herbivores and necrotrophic fungi are mediated by jasmonates. We demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; is induced upon wounding and feeding of the insect herbivore &lt;i&gt;Spodoptera littoralis&lt;/i&gt;. However, neither different &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function mutant lines nor overexpression lines were impaired upon insect feeding. No difference in herbivore-induced phytohormone elevation was detected in &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; lines. The defense against the spider mite &lt;i&gt;Tetranychus urticae&lt;/i&gt; was also unaffected. In addition, &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; mutant lines showed a wild type-like reaction to the necrotrophic fungus &lt;i&gt;Alternaria brassicicola&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our data suggest that CML9 might be a regulator involved only in the defense against biotrophic pathogens, independent of jasmonates. In addition, our data challenge the involvement of CML9 in plant drought stress response. Taken together, we suggest that CML9 is a specialized rather than a general regulator of stress responses in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197633</originId><fingerprint>68bdc357</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197633</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Monika Heyer, Sandra S.

Acute post-operative pain can remain untreated if patients cannot express themselves. The perfusion index (PI) may decrease when pain activates sympathetic tone and may increase after analgesics are administered. We evaluated if the perfusion index is a feasible indicator for objectively assessing pain relief in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and calculated the changes in PI measurements at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements to examine if the PI is a useful criterion for discharging patients from the postanesthesia care unit. This retrospective observational study enrolled female patients who were admitted for gynecological or general surgery. The patients received general anesthesia and were admitted to the postanesthesia care unit. The PI, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded before and after administration of intravenous morphine. Changes in these parameters before and after analgesics were administered and the difference of these parameters between age and BMI subgroups were compared. The correlation between the PI and VAS score, ΔPI and ΔVAS, and %ΔPI and %ΔVAS were also evaluated. The percentage change in ΔPI (P9-T0/T0) of the patients at the time of discharge from the postanesthesia care unit relative to baseline PI measurements was calculated. Eighty patients were enrolled, and there were 123 instances during which analgesia was required. Heart rate, PI, and VAS score were significantly different before and after analgesics were administered (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The difference of parameters between age and BMI subgroups were not significant. The correlation between the PI and VAS score, ΔPI and ΔVAS, and the percentage change in ΔPI and ΔVAS showed weak correlations in age, BMI subgroups, and all measurements. The baseline PI and the PI when arriving at and when being discharged from the postanesthesia care unit were significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The mean percentage change in Δ PI at the time of discharge from the PACU was 66.2%, and the 99% confidence interval was 12.2%~120.3%. The perfusion index was increased, and the VAS score was decreased significantly after analgesics were administered, but the correlation was weak in each subgroup. The VAS score is a subjective and psychometric parameter. The PI increased when partial pain relief was achieved after morphine was administered but did not reflect pain intensity or changes in the VAS score regardless of age or BMI. A percentage change in ΔPI at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements of greater than 12% can be used as a supplemental objective discharge criterion for pain assessment in the postanesthesia care unit.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197630</originId><fingerprint>c2c2f590</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197630</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chun-Lin Chu, Yi-You Huang, Ying-Hou Chen, Ling-Ping Lai, Huei-Ming Yeh&lt;/p&gt;

The adipose tissue (AT) contributes to systemic and B cell intrinsic inflammation, reduced B cell responses and secretion of autoimmune antibodies. In this study we show that adipocytes in the human obese subcutaneous AT (SAT) secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation, and consequent suboptimal immune responses in obese individuals, as we have previously shown. We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies. During the development of obesity, reduced oxygen and consequent hypoxia and cell death lead to further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, “self” protein antigens, cell-free DNA and lipids. All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of “self” antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197472</originId><fingerprint>87853ac7</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197472</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Frasca, Alain Diaz, Maria Romero, Seth Thaller, Bonnie B.

In this study we show that adipocytes in the human obese subcutaneous AT (SAT) secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation, and consequent suboptimal immune responses in obese individuals, as we have previously shown. We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies. During the development of obesity, reduced oxygen and consequent hypoxia and cell death lead to further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, “self” protein antigens, cell-free DNA and lipids. All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of “self” antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Secretion of autoimmune antibodies in the human subcutaneous adipose tissue</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526504400000</updated></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85452:93d646dc</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197942</link><author><name>Juan H.

Production of the iron regulatory peptide hepcidin is tightly controlled by a network of proteins in hepatocytes that sense levels of iron in the circulation (as diferric-transferrin) and in tissues (in ferritin). Human studies show high variability in the normal range of serum hepcidin levels. We have postulated that this may, in part, be related to inter-individual variability in the expression of genes in the iron sensing pathway, potentially governed by epigenetic factors. Here, we have investigated whether genes encoding hepatic iron sensing proteins and hepcidin are regulated by DNA methylation. Experiments were performed on two human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells. Basal expression of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in Huh7 cells compared with HepG2 cells. Analysis of bisulphite-converted DNA from Huh7 cells revealed partial methylation of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; (alpha transcript), which could result in gene silencing. Demethylation using 5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine (AZA) increased &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7. PCR analysis of bisulphite-converted &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; promoter DNA, using methylation-specific primers, revealed no differences between cell lines. However, &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7 was increased by AZA treatment, suggesting that methylation of one or more iron sensing genes may indirectly influence &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; expression. Our study provides evidence that DNA methylation might control expression of &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; and other hepatic iron sensing genes, and indicates that epigenetic influences on iron homeostasis warrant further investigation.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197863</originId><fingerprint>c9382993</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197863</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paul A.

To exploit the plethora of information provided by Next Generation Sequencing, the identification of the genetic mutations responsible for disease in general or cancer in particular, among the thousands of neutral germline or somatic variations is a crucial task. Genome-wide association studies for the detection of disease-associated genes or cancer drivers can only identify common variations or driver genes in a cohort of patients. Thus, they cannot discover unique disease-associated mutations or cancer driver genes on a personal basis. Moreover, even when there are such common variations, their significance is unknown. Here, we extend the machine learning based approach ENTPRISE developed for predicting the disease association of missense mutations to frameshift and nonsense mutations. The new approach, ENTPRISE-X, is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods VEST-indel and DDIG-in for predicting the disease association of germline frameshift mutations in terms of balanced measure Matthew’s correlation coefficient, MCC, with a MCC of 0.586 for ENTPRISE-X, versus 0.412 by VEST-indel and 0.321 by DDIG-in, respectively. Large scale testing on the ExAC dataset shows ENTPRISE-X has a much lower fraction of 16% of variations classified as disease causing, as compared to VEST-indel’s 26% and DDIG-in’s 65% of predictions as being disease-associated.

Here, we parameterized the model to reproduce experimental solvation free energies of a set of small molecules. The model reproduces well‐experimental solvation free energies of 70 molecules, yielding a root mean square difference of 0.8 kcal/mol versus 2.5 kcal/mol for the CHARMM36 additive force field. The polarization work associated with the solute transfer from the gas‐phase to the polar solvent, a term neglected in the framework of additive force fields, was found to make a large contribution to the total solvation free energy, comparable to the polar solute–solvent solvation contribution. The Drude PB/SASA also reproduces well the electronic polarization from the explicit solvent simulations of a small protein, BPTI. Model validation was based on comparisons with the experimental relative binding free energies of 371 single alanine mutations. With the Drude PB/SASA model the root mean square deviation between the predicted and experimental relative binding free energies is 3.35 kcal/mol, lower than 5.11 kcal/mol computed with the CHARMM36 additive force field.

This paper presents the design and fabrication of a multi-layer and multi-chamber microchip system using thiol-ene ‘click chemistry’ aimed for drug transport studies across tissue barrier models. The fabrication process enables rapid prototyping of multi-layer microfluidic chips using different thiol-ene polymer mixtures, where porous Teflon membranes for cell monolayer growth were incorporated by masked sandwiching thiol-ene-based fluid layers. Electrodes for trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements were incorporated using low-melting soldering wires in combination with platinum wires, enabling parallel real-time monitoring of barrier integrity for the eight chambers. Additionally, the translucent porous Teflon membrane enabled optical monitoring of cell monolayers. The device was developed and tested with the Caco-2 intestinal model, and compared to the conventional Transwell system. Cell monolayer differentiation was assessed via &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; immunocytochemistry of tight junction and mucus proteins, P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) mediated efflux of Rhodamine 123, and brush border aminopeptidase activity. Monolayer tightness and relevance for drug delivery research was evaluated through permeability studies of mannitol, dextran and insulin, alone or in combination with the absorption enhancer tetradecylmaltoside (TDM). The thiol-ene-based microchip material and electrodes were highly compatible with cell growth. In fact, Caco-2 cells cultured in the device displayed differentiation, mucus production, directional transport and aminopeptidase activity within 9–10 days of cell culture, indicating robust barrier formation at a faster rate than in conventional Transwell models. The cell monolayer displayed high TEER and tightness towards hydrophilic compounds, whereas co-administration of an absorption enhancer elicited TEER-decrease and increased permeability similar to the Transwell cultures. The presented cell barrier microdevice constitutes a relevant tissue barrier model, enabling transport studies of drugs and chemicals under real-time optical and functional monitoring in eight parallel chambers, thereby increasing the throughput compared to previously reported microdevices.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197101</originId><fingerprint>328caae4</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197101</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hsih-Yin Tan, Sofie Trier, Ulrik L.

The energy-growth nexus has important policy implications for economic development. The results from many past studies that investigated the causality direction of this nexus can lead to misleading policy guidance. Using data on China from 1953 to 2013, this study shows that an application of causality test on the time series of energy consumption and national output has masked a lot of information. The Toda-Yamamoto test with bootstrapped critical values and the newly proposed non-linear causality test reveal no causal relationship. However, a further application of these tests using series in different time-frequency domain obtained from wavelet decomposition indicates that while energy consumption Granger causes economic growth in the short run, the reverse is true in the medium term. A bidirectional causal relationship is found for the long run. This approach has proven to be superior in unveiling information on the energy-growth nexus that are useful for policy planning over different time horizons.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197785</originId><fingerprint>53fee790</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197785</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Junsheng Ha, Pei-Pei Tan, Kim-Leng Goh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is a vector-borne bacterial infection that is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. If not treated with antibiotics during the early stages of infection, disseminated infection can spread to the central nervous system (CNS). In non-human primates (NHPs) it has been demonstrated that the leptomeninges are among the tissues colonized by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; spirochetes. Although the NHP model parallels aspects of human borreliosis, a small rodent model would be ideal to study the trafficking of spirochetes and immune cells into the CNS. Here we show that during early and late disseminated infection, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; infects the meninges of intradermally infected mice, and is associated with concurrent increases in meningeal T cells. We found that the dura mater was consistently culture positive for spirochetes in transcardially perfused mice, independent of the strain of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; used. Within the dura mater, spirochetes were preferentially located in vascular regions, but were also present in perivascular, and extravascular regions, as late as 75 days post-infection. At the same end-point, we observed significant increases in the number of CD3+ T cells within the pia and dura mater, as compared to controls. Flow cytometric analysis of leukocytes isolated from the dura mater revealed that CD3+ cell populations were comprised of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that similarly to infection in peripheral tissues, spirochetes adhere to the dura mater during disseminated infection, and are associated with increases in the number of meningeal T cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that there are aspects of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; meningeal infection that can be modelled in laboratory mice, suggesting that mice may be useful for elucidating mechanisms of meningeal pathogenesis by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196893</originId><fingerprint>fe2946bc</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196893</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ali Divan, Timothy Casselli, S.

At the same end-point, we observed significant increases in the number of CD3+ T cells within the pia and dura mater, as compared to controls. Flow cytometric analysis of leukocytes isolated from the dura mater revealed that CD3+ cell populations were comprised of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that similarly to infection in peripheral tissues, spirochetes adhere to the dura mater during disseminated infection, and are associated with increases in the number of meningeal T cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that there are aspects of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; meningeal infection that can be modelled in laboratory mice, suggesting that mice may be useful for elucidating mechanisms of meningeal pathogenesis by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&amp;lt;/i&gt; adhere to blood vessels in the dura mater and are associated with increased meningeal T cells during murine disseminated borreliosis</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525381200000</updated></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1631d51f359:2877c86:fc1f8953</id><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4541.short?rss=1</link><author><name>Suzanne Bell, Sunita Sah, Thomas D.
