Background &lt;p&gt;Cancer and factor V Leiden mutation are both risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Cancer critically increases the thrombotic risk whereas Factor V Leiden is the most common pro-thrombotic mutation. The impact of the factor V Leiden on the risk of VTE in cancer patients remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the impact of factor V Leiden mutation in cancer-associated thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The EDITH hospital-based case-control study enrolled 182 patients with cancer and VTE as well as 182 control patients with cancer, matched for gender, age and cancer location, between 2000 and 2012, in the University Hospital of Brest. All cases and controls were genotyped for the factor V Leiden mutation and interviewed with a standardized questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty one of 182 (11.5%) patients with cancer-associated thrombosis carried the factor V Leiden mutation and 4 of 182 (2.2%) controls with cancer but no venous thrombosis. In multivariate analysis including cancer stage and family history of VTE, cancer patients with factor V Leiden mutation had a seven-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.04; 95% CI, 2.01–24.63).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The pro-thrombotic Factor V Leiden mutation was found to be an independent additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism in cancer patients and might therefore be considered in the individual thrombotic risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194973</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Risk of venous thromboembolism in association with factor V leiden in cancer patients – The EDITH case-control study</title><author><name>Adeline Heraudeau</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194973</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Adeline Heraudeau, Aurélien Delluc, Mickaël Le Henaff, Karine Lacut, Christophe Leroyer, Benoit Desrues, Francis Couturaud, Cécile Tromeur&lt;/p&gt;

Secreted Nano-luciferase (secNluc) is a newly engineered secreted luciferase that possesses advantages of high structural stability, long half-life, and glow-type kinetics together with high light emission intensity, and thus would become one of the most valuable tools for bioluminescence assays. However, like other secreted luciferases, secNluc has to mix with the components in the conditioned medium surrounding test cells, or in the biological samples such as blood or urine after being secreted. These components may interfere with secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions and thus limit the application of the secNluc reporter system. In this study, we first examined the effects of three factors, pH, serum and residual reagents, on secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions, finding that these factors could interfere with bioluminescence reactions and result in background signal. To resolve these problems, we applied a simple affinity purification strategy in which secNluc was fused with a FLAG-tag, and anti-FLAG magnetic beads were used to catch and transfer the fusion protein to PBST, an optimal buffer for secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions that was identified in this study. The results indicated that this strategy could not only negate the interferences from serum or residual reagents and enhance the stability of light emission but also greatly increase signal intensity through enzyme enrichment. This strategy may contribute to biomedical studies that utilize secNluc and other secreted luciferases, especially those requiring superior sensitivity, low background noise and high reproducibility.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196617</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Optimized application of the secreted Nano-luciferase reporter system using an affinity purification strategy</title><author><name>JingZhe Li</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196617</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by JingZhe Li, ZhiLan Guo, Takashi Sato, Bo Yuan, YanYan Ma, Dan Qian, JuYing Zhong, MengMeng Jin, Peng Huang, LuYang Che, Yi Wang, Yan Lei, ChangZhen Liu&lt;/p&gt;

This strategy may contribute to biomedical studies that utilize secNluc and other secreted luciferases, especially those requiring superior sensitivity, low background noise and high reproducibility.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525294800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196617</link><fingerprint>ec3a1a49</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a180:93d646dc</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196617</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1526473042015</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05154-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05154-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05154-5</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Romans would have denied robots legal personhood</title><author><name>Luciano Floridi</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05154-5</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05154-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05154-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526454000000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05154-5</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>7a0abceb</fingerprint><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16368e2285f:3fa1a20:3dd877af</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>9</engagement></item><item><updated>1526936400000</updated><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lynne Cassimeris, Jessica C.

Microtubules are dynamic polymers required for a number of processes, including chromosome movement in mitosis. While regulators of microtubule dynamics have been well characterized, we lack a convenient way to predict how the measured dynamic parameters shape the entire microtubule system within a cell, or how the system responds when specific parameters change in response to internal or external signals. Here we describe a Monte Carlo model to simulate an array of dynamic microtubules from parameters including the cell radius, total tubulin concentration, microtubule nucleation rate from the centrosome, and plus end dynamic instability. The algorithm also allows dynamic instability or position of the cell edge to vary during the simulation. Outputs from simulations include free tubulin concentration, average microtubule lengths, length distributions, and individual length changes over time. Using this platform and reported parameters measured in interphase LLCPK1 epithelial cells, we predict that sequestering ~ 15–20% of total tubulin results in fewer microtubules, but promotes dynamic instability of those remaining. Simulations also predict that lowering nucleation rate will increase the stability and average length of the remaining microtubules. Allowing the position of the cell’s edge to vary over time changed the average length but not the number of microtubules and generated length distributions consistent with experimental measurements. Simulating the switch from interphase to prophase demonstrated that decreased rescue frequency at prophase is the critical factor needed to rapidly clear the cell of interphase microtubules prior to mitotic spindle assembly. Finally, consistent with several previous simulations, our results demonstrate that microtubule nucleation and dynamic instability in a confined space determines the partitioning of tubulin between monomer and polymer pools. The model and simulations will be useful for predicting changes to the entire microtubule array after modification to one or more parameters, including predicting the effects of tubulin-targeted chemotherapies.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197538</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Monte Carlo simulations of microtubule arrays: The critical roles of rescue transitions, the cell boundary, and tubulin concentration in shaping microtubule distributions</title><author><name>Lynne Cassimeris</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197538</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lynne Cassimeris, Jessica C.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the nationwide seasonal peaks, risk factors, and utilization of medical resources of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization (RSVH) in preterm infants in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;A Taiwan nationwide birth cohort was extracted from the Birth Certificate Application Database during 2007–2009 and prospectively linked to the National Health Insurance database. We evaluated the seasonal peaks and risk factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with the RSVH of preterm infants. The length of hospital stays (LOS), care in intensive care unit (ICU), and use of mechanical ventilation (MV) were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan, three seasonal peaks and two seasonal peaks of RSVH in preterm infants with BPD and without BPD, respectively. Preterm infants had significantly higher RSVH rate than term infants (2.6% vs 0.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants born at 29–35 weeks of gestational age (wGA) with BPD had significantly higher RSVH rate than those without BPD (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants without BPD born at &amp;lt; 32 wGA had higher RSVH rate than those born at 33–35 wGA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Overall, 56.4% of RSVH occurred within 9 months of CA. Preterm infants with BPD had significantly higher ICU admission rate within 18 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), MV usage within 12 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and LOS within 18 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) than those without BPD. RSVH occurred within 6 months of CA was significantly associated with higher ICU admission rate (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), MV usage (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002) and longer LOS (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) in preterm infants without BPD.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan.

Because stability is far from assured for any individual hit list, GOTrack can lead to more informed and cautious application of GO to genomics research.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526194800000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/320861v1?rss=1</link><fingerprint>e6097e68</fingerprint><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1635cd49dc3:2d68bc3:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><updated>1527195600000</updated><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198378</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Correction: Utilization of Landsat-8 data for the estimation of carrot and maize crop water footprint under the arid climate of Saudi Arabia</title><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198378</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1527195600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198378</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>f9f06aef</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4f6:3dd877af</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198378</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525273326116</crawled><description>Water splitting using polymer photocatalysts is a

NAC proteins are a family of transcription factors which have a variety of important regulatory roles in plants. They present a very well conserved group of NAC subdomains in the N-terminal region and a highly variable domain at the C-terminus. Currently, knowledge concerning NAC family in the strawberry plant remains very limited. In this work, we analyzed the NAC family of &lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;, and a total of 112 NAC proteins were identified after we curated the annotations from the version 4.0.a1 genome. They were placed into the ligation groups (pseudo-chromosomes) and described its physicochemical and genetic features. A microarray transcriptomic analysis showed six of them expressed during the development and ripening of the &lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; x &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit. Their expression patterns were studied in fruit (receptacle and achenes) in different stages of development and in vegetative tissues. Also, the expression level under different hormonal treatments (auxins, ABA) and drought stress was investigated. In addition, they were clustered with other NAC transcription factor with known function related to growth and development, senescence, fruit ripening, stress response, and secondary cell wall and vascular development. Our results indicate that these six strawberry NAC proteins could play different important regulatory roles in the process of development and ripening of the fruit, providing the basis for further functional studies and the selection for NAC candidates suitable for biotechnological applications.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196953</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Genome-wide analysis of the NAC transcription factor family and their expression during the development and ripening of the &amp;lt;i&gt;Fragaria&amp;lt;/i&gt; × &amp;lt;i&gt;ananassa&amp;lt;/i&gt; fruits</title><author><name>Enriqueta Moyano</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196953</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Enriqueta Moyano, Félix J.

In anaplastic thyroid cancer C643 cells, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) attenuates migration by activating the S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor and the Rho-ROCK pathway. In the present study, we show that stimulating C643 cells with S1P decreases the expression, secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and to a lesser extent MMP9. Using receptor-specific antagonists, and S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; siRNA, we showed that the inhibition of expression of MMP2 is mediated through S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, S1P inhibited calpain activity, and inhibiting calpain pharmacologically, inhibited the effect of S1P on MMP2 expression and activity, and on MMP9 activity. S1P treatment increased Rho activity, and by incubating cells with the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase or the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, the S1P-induced inhibition of invasion and MMP2 expression and activity was abolished. We conclude that S1P attenuates the invasion of C643 cells by activating S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the Rho-ROCK pathway, by decreasing calpain activity, and by decreasing the expression, secretion and activity of MMP2 and, to a lesser extent, MMP9.

Herein, we theoretically reproduce the UV–vis absorption spectrum of aqueous solution of Tyrosine in its zwitterionic, anionic and cationic forms, as well as of aqua‐p‐Cresol (i.e., the moiety that constitutes the side chain portion of Tyrosine). To achieve a better accuracy in the MD sampling, the Tyrosine Force Field (FF) parameters were derived de novo via quantum mechanical calculations. The UV–vis absorption spectra are computed considering the occurring electronic transitions in the vertical approximation for each of the chromophore configurations sampled by the classical MD simulations, thus including the effects of the chromophore semiclassical structural fluctuations. Finally, the explicit treatment of the perturbing effect of the embedding environment permits to fully model the inhomogeneous bandwidth of the electronic spectra. Comparison between our theoretical–computational results and experimental data shows that the used model captures the essential features of the spectroscopic process, thus allowing to perform further analysis on the strict relationship between the quantum properties of the chromophore and the different embedding environments. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25351?af=R</originId><origin><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Tyrosine absorption spectroscopy: Backbone protonation effects on the side chain electronic properties</title><author><name>SaraDel Galdo

Herein, we theoretically reproduce the UV–vis absorption spectrum of aqueous solution of Tyrosine in its zwitterionic, anionic and cationic forms, as well as of aqua‐p‐Cresol (i.e., the moiety that constitutes the side chain portion of Tyrosine). To achieve a better accuracy in the MD sampling, the Tyrosine Force Field (FF) parameters were derived de novo via quantum mechanical calculations. The UV–vis absorption spectra are computed considering the occurring electronic transitions in the vertical approximation for each of the chromophore configurations sampled by the classical MD simulations, thus including the effects of the chromophore semiclassical structural fluctuations. Finally, the explicit treatment of the perturbing effect of the embedding environment permits to fully model the inhomogeneous bandwidth of the electronic spectra. Comparison between our theoretical–computational results and experimental data shows that the used model captures the essential features of the spectroscopic process, thus allowing to perform further analysis on the strict relationship between the quantum properties of the chromophore and the different embedding environments. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><crawled>1527095622277</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An increase in the &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C + &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C fusion rate from resonances at astrophysical energies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in the &amp;lt;sup&gt;12&amp;lt;/sup&gt;C + &amp;lt;sup&gt;12&amp;lt;/sup&gt;C fusion rate from resonances at astrophysical energies, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0149-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0149-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The rate of carbon burning—12C + 12C fusion—in stars is boosted by resonant behaviour at astrophysical energies.</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0149-4</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>An increase in the 12C + 12C fusion rate from resonances at astrophysical energies</title><engagementRate>0.41</engagementRate><author><name>A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). The exact influence of ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFL thickness (RNFLT) is unknown and was analysed in a subgroup of the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Global peripapillary RNFLT was measured in 3224 eyes of 1973 subjects (49% female) using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The association of age, sex, ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFLT was analysed using Pearson correlation coefficient and fitting a linear mixed model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the univariable analysis highest correlations were found for axial length (r = -0.27), spherical equivalent (r = 0.24), and glaucoma (r = -0.15) (p&amp;lt;0.0001, respectively). Other significant correlations with RNFLT were found for age, sex, intraocular pressure, systemic hypertension and systolic blood pressure, previous eye surgery, cholesterol, homocysteine, history of coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, apnoea, diabetes and alcohol intake, p&amp;lt;0.05, respectively. Body length, body weight, BMI, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1c, history of apoplexy, cognitive function, peripheral artery disease, tinnitus, migraine, nicotine intake, central corneal thickness, and pseudophakia were not significantly correlated with RNFLT. The regression model revealed a significant relationship between RNFLT and age in decades (p&amp;lt;0.02), spherical equivalent (p&amp;lt;0.0001), axial length (p&amp;lt;0.0001), glaucoma (p&amp;lt;0.0001), tinnitus (p = 0.04), apnoea (p = 0.047), homocysteine (p = 0.05) and alcohol intake &gt;10g/d for women and &gt;20g/d for men (p = 0.02). Glaucoma, apnoea, higher homocysteine, higher alcohol intake and higher axial length as well as age were related to decreased RNFLT while higher spherical equivalent or history for tinnitus were related to thicker RNFL.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;RNFLT is related to age, ocular parameters and lifestyle factors. Considering these parameters in normative databases could improve the evaluation of peripapillary RNFLT. It is necessary to evaluate if a reduction of alcohol intake as well as the therapy of apnea or high homocysteine levels could positively influence RNFLT.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197682</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Association of ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric and lifestyle parameters with retinal nerve fibre layer thickness</title><author><name>Julia Lamparter</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197682</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Julia Lamparter, Irene Schmidtmann, Alexander K.

Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease, with considerable genetic contribution. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified a number of genomic regions for the risk of psoriasis. However, it is challenging to pinpoint the functional causal variants and then further decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying each region. In order to prioritize potential functional causal variants within psoriasis susceptibility regions, we integrated the genetic association findings and functional genomic data publicly available, i.e. histone modifications in relevant immune cells. We characterized a pervasive enrichment pattern of psoriasis variants in five core histone marks across immune cells/tissues. We discovered that genetic alleles within psoriasis association regions might influence gene expression levels through significantly affecting the binding affinities of 17 transcription factors. We established a catalog of 654 potential functional causal variants for psoriasis and suggested that they significantly overlapped with causal variants for autoimmune diseases. We identified potential causal variant rs79824801 overlay with the peaks of five histone marks in primary CD4+ T cells. Its alternative allele affected the binding affinity of transcription factor &lt;i&gt;IKZF1&lt;/i&gt;. This study highlights the complex genetic architecture and complicated mechanisms for psoriasis. The findings will inform the functional experiment design for psoriasis.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196635</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>A catalog of potential putative functional variants in psoriasis genome-wide association regions</title><author><name>Yan Lin</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196635</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yan Lin, Lu Liu, Yujun Sheng, Changbing Shen, Xiaodong Zheng, Fusheng Zhou, Sen Yang, Xianyong Yin, Xuejun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

And that’s the currency of the realm: do you want to build up larger molecules from smaller precursors in a controlled fashion? You’re going to have to make bonds when and where you want them to form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those organometallic reagents are tricky beasts, whether catalytic or stoichiometric. Just understanding what the actual structures of some of them are has occupied people for years on end, because a given system can adopt a whole range of structures – and thus form completely different reagents – depending on solvent, temperature, counterions, concentration, added salts, stoichiometry, order of addition, and so on. To make matters more interesting, some of the actual reactive species are formed only in small, transient amounts, which makes proving their existence even more fraught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201802087&quot;&gt;a recent example&lt;/a&gt;. One of the many things you can do with Grignard reagents, a classic organometallic species if ever there was, is to couple them onto vinyl bromides and haloalkenes in general, with iron catalysis. It turns out, though, that the yields for this are far better when the reaction is run in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) than in any other solvent (an effect discovered in 1998, over twenty years since the reaction was first reported). That one’s not exactly the first choice for this sort of thing, so it’s interesting to know that it works so well. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-300x180.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-300x180.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-768x460.jpeg 768w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP.jpeg 996w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13567&quot; height=&quot;180&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had already been figured out that if you take methylmagnesium bromide and an iron(III) salt in THF, that a new species forms: magnesium(penta-THF) chloride cation and a penta-iron-octa-methyl cluster anion. That was thought to be the active methyl-coupling reagent, but the yields are never that great in THF (which is probably what led to the solvent screening work that uncovered the NMP effect). Now we finally know what that works. In that new solvent, a completely different complex salt forms: magnesium hexa-NMP cation (+2 charge), with two trimethyliron anions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those irons are exceptionally reactive; you really don’t see alkyliron species without other stabilizing ligands on them very often, but for some reason you get them here. NMP is a pretty highly coordinating solvent, so in the absence of experimental evidence you’d figure that the solvent is in there on both the iron and magnesium centers. But it turns out that it’s just the latter (as suggested by magnetic circular dichroism spectra in solution, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ssbauer_spectroscopy&quot;&gt;Mössbauer spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; along with X-ray diffraction on isolated crystals of the complex. Mössbauer is not the first technique you reach for (since you need an appropriate gamma-ray source) but it’s extremely sensitive to several different kinds of changes that affect the energy levels of sensitive nuclei, which are mostly metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know, and another piece of knowledge gets added to the organometallic pile, and another idea for future reagents and reactions gets queued up. Eventually we’ll understand this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagementRate>0.17</engagementRate><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/29/organometallic-oddities</href></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><published>1527602714000</published><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13566</link><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP.jpeg</url><height>596</height><width>996</width></visual><fingerprint>e25bf7f9</fingerprint><title>Organometallic Oddities</title><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Synthetic organic chemists spend a lot of time using organometallic coupling reactions, because they can be such great ways to make carbon-carbon (and carbon-heteroatom) bonds.

Closed-loop neurotechnologies often need to adaptively learn an encoding model that relates the neural activity to the brain state, and is used for brain state decoding. The speed and accuracy of adaptive learning algorithms are critically affected by the learning rate, which dictates how fast model parameters are updated based on new observations. Despite the importance of the learning rate, currently an analytical approach for its selection is largely lacking and existing signal processing methods vastly tune it empirically or heuristically. Here, we develop a novel analytical calibration algorithm for optimal selection of the learning rate in adaptive Bayesian filters. We formulate the problem through a fundamental trade-off that learning rate introduces between the steady-state error and the convergence time of the estimated model parameters. We derive explicit functions that predict the effect of learning rate on error and convergence time. Using these functions, our calibration algorithm can keep the steady-state parameter error covariance smaller than a desired upper-bound while minimizing the convergence time, or keep the convergence time faster than a desired value while minimizing the error. We derive the algorithm both for discrete-valued spikes modeled as point processes nonlinearly dependent on the brain state, and for continuous-valued neural recordings modeled as Gaussian processes linearly dependent on the brain state. Using extensive closed-loop simulations, we show that the analytical solution of the calibration algorithm accurately predicts the effect of learning rate on parameter error and convergence time. Moreover, the calibration algorithm allows for fast and accurate learning of the encoding model and for fast convergence of decoding to accurate performance. Finally, larger learning rates result in inaccurate encoding models and decoders, and smaller learning rates delay their convergence. The calibration algorithm provides a novel analytical approach to predictably achieve a desired level of error and convergence time in adaptive learning, with application to closed-loop neurotechnologies and other signal processing domains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AXBHSencE5U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006168</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Han-Lin Hsieh, Maryam M.

Aluminum-based adjuvants have widely been used in human vaccines since 1926. In the absence of antigens, aluminum-based adjuvants can initiate the inflammatory preparedness of innate cells, yet the impact of antigens on this response has not been investigated so far. In this study, we address the modulating effect of vaccine antigens on the monocyte-derived innate response by comparing processes initiated by Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and by Infanrix, an Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-adjuvanted trivalent combination vaccine (DTaP), containing diphtheria toxoid (D), tetanus toxoid (T) and acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine antigens. A systems-wide analysis of stimulated monocytes was performed in which full proteome analysis was combined with targeted transcriptome analysis and cytokine analysis. This comprehensive study revealed four major differences in the monocyte response, between plain Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DTaP stimulation conditions: (I) DTaP increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, whereas Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; did not; (II) Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increased the gene expression of &lt;i&gt;IFNγ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;IL-17a&lt;/i&gt; in contrast to the limited induction or even downregulation by DTaP; (III) increased expression of type I interferons-induced proteins was not observed upon DTaP stimulation, but was observed upon Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stimulation; (IV) opposing regulation of protein localization pathways was observed for Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DTaP stimulation, related to the induction of exocytosis by Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alone. This study highlights that vaccine antigens can antagonize Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced programming of the innate immune responses at the monocyte level.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197885</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Vaccine antigens modulate the innate response of monocytes to Al(OH)&amp;lt;sub&gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&gt;</title><author><name>Sietske Kooijman</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197885</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sietske Kooijman, Jolanda Brummelman, Cécile A.

Gene expression in eukaryotes is controlled by DNA sequences at promoter and enhancer regions, whose accessibility for binding by regulatory proteins dictates their specific patterns of activity. Here, we identify the protein Zbtb7a as a factor required for inducible changes in accessibility driven by transcription factors (TFs). We show that Zbtb7a binds to a significant fraction of genomic promoters and enhancers, encompassing many target genes of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) p65 and a variety of other TFs. While Zbtb7a binding is not alone sufficient to directly activate promoters, it is required to enable TF-dependent control of accessibility and normal gene expression. Using p65 as a model TF, we show that Zbtb7a associates with promoters independently of client TF binding. Moreover, the presence of prebound Zbtb7a can specify promoters that are amenable to TF-induced changes in accessibility. Therefore, Zbtb7a represents a widely used promoter factor that transduces signals from other TFs to enable control of accessibility and regulation of gene expression.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0hCOgv8f0oI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004526</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by José Miguel Ramos Pittol, Agata Oruba, Gerhard Mittler, Simona Saccani, Dominic van Essen&lt;/p&gt;

Pathogen load determines the outcome of many infections, and is a consequence of pathogen multiplication rate, duration of the infection, and inhibition or killing of pathogen by the host (resistance). If these determinants of pathogen load could be quantified then their mechanistic correlates might be determined. In humans the timing of infection is rarely known and treatment cannot usually be withheld to monitor serial changes in pathogen load and host response. Here we present an approach to overcome this and identify potential mechanisms of resistance which control parasite load in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Using a mathematical model of longitudinal infection dynamics for orientation, we made individualized estimates of parasite multiplication and growth inhibition in Gambian children at presentation with acute malaria and used whole blood RNA-sequencing to identify their correlates. We identified novel roles for secreted proteases cathepsin G and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) as direct effector molecules which inhibit P. falciparum growth. Cathepsin G acts on the erythrocyte membrane, cleaving surface receptors required for parasite invasion, whilst MMP9 acts on the parasite. In contrast, the type 1 interferon response and expression of CXCL10 (IFN-{gamma}-inducible protein of 10 kDa, IP-10) were detrimental to control of parasite growth. Natural variation in iron status and plasma levels of complement factor H were determinants of parasite multiplication rate. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for the dynamic interaction between host and pathogen when seeking to identify correlates of protection, and reveal novel mechanisms controlling parasite growth in humans.

Cities around the world are inundated by cars and suffer traffic congestion that results in excess delays, reduced safety and environmental pollution. The interplay between road infrastructure and travel choices defines the level and the spatio-temporal extent of congestion. Given the existing infrastructure, understanding how the route choice decisions are made and how travellers interact with each other is a crucial first step in mitigating traffic congestion. This is a problem with fundamental importance, as it has implications for other limited supply systems where agents compete for resources and reach an equilibrium. Here, we observe the route choice decisions and the traffic conditions through an extensive data set of GPS trajectories. We compare the actual paths followed by travellers to those implied by equilibrium conditions (i) at a microscopic scale, where we focus on individual path similarities, and (ii) at a macroscopic scale, where we perform network-level comparison of the traffic loads. We present that non-cooperative or selfish equilibrium replicates the actual traffic (to a certain extent) at the macroscopic scale, while the majority of individual decisions cannot be reproduced by neither selfish nor cooperative equilibrium models.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196997</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Searching for empirical evidence on traffic equilibrium</title><author><name>Mehmet Yildirimoglu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196997</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mehmet Yildirimoglu, Osman Kahraman&lt;/p&gt;

We present that non-cooperative or selfish equilibrium replicates the actual traffic (to a certain extent) at the macroscopic scale, while the majority of individual decisions cannot be reproduced by neither selfish nor cooperative equilibrium models.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525726800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196997</link><fingerprint>2c6b7423</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42265:5785ab88</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196997</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/698?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/698.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395db:3dd877af</id><author><name>Clery, D.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/698?rss=1</href></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><published>1526578752000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/698?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>29af1ab9</fingerprint><title>China&apos;s moon mission is set to probe cosmic dark ages</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><keywords><item>Astronomy, Planetary Science</item></keywords><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0033-7</href></item></canonical><crawled>1525706901788</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Predicting breast cancer therapeutic response&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predicting breast cancer therapeutic response, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0033-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0033-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In triple-negative breast cancer, therapeutic response to carboplatin and docetaxel is similar.

However, training complex deep neural nets requires large-scale datasets labeled with ground truth, which are often unavailable in many medical image domains.

Experimental results show that DeepEM can lead to 1.5\% and 3.9\% average improvement in free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) scores on LUNA16 and Tianchi datasets, respectively, demonstrating the utility of incomplete information in EMRs for improving deep learning algorithms. https://github.com/uci-cbcl/DeepEM-for-Weakly-Supervised-Detection.git</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526281200000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322370v1?rss=1</link><fingerprint>139e22a8</fingerprint><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163609f2279:326ef7c:3dd877af</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26137-6</href></item></canonical><crawled>1526548636221</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identification and tissue distribution of chemosensory protein and odorant binding protein genes in &lt;i&gt;Tropidothorax elegans&lt;/i&gt; Distant (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identification and tissue distribution of chemosensory protein and odorant binding protein genes in &amp;lt;i&gt;Tropidothorax elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; Distant (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26137-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26137-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Identification and tissue distribution of chemosensory protein and odorant binding protein genes in &lt;i&gt;Tropidothorax elegans&lt;/i&gt; Distant (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae)&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/bWWSnD8uvCs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26137-6</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Identification and tissue distribution of chemosensory protein and odorant binding protein genes in Tropidothorax elegans Distant (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae)</title><author><name>Yue-Qin Song</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/bWWSnD8uvCs/s41598-018-26137-6</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identification and tissue distribution of chemosensory protein and odorant binding protein genes in &lt;i&gt;Tropidothorax elegans&lt;/i&gt; Distant (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identification and tissue distribution of chemosensory protein and odorant binding protein genes in &amp;lt;i&gt;Tropidothorax elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; Distant (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26137-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26137-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Identification and tissue distribution of chemosensory protein and odorant binding protein genes in &lt;i&gt;Tropidothorax elegans&lt;/i&gt; Distant (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae)&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/bWWSnD8uvCs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526540400000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26137-6</link><fingerprint>dbb00265</fingerprint><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1636d63a23d:48fc37d:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00367</href></item></canonical><crawled>1526675296015</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00367/20180518/images/medium/bi-2018-00367c_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00367&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Ferroptosis is a cell death process driven by damage to cell membranes and linked to numerous human diseases. Ferroptosis is caused by loss of activity of the key enzyme that is tasked with repairing oxidative damage to cell membranes—glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). GPX4 normally removes the dangerous products of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, protecting cell membranes from this type of damage; when GPX4 fails, ferroptosis ensues. Ferroptosis is distinct from apoptosis, necroptosis, necrosis, and other modes of cell death. Several key mysteries regarding how cells die during ferroptosis remain unsolved. First, the drivers of lipid peroxidation are not yet clear. Second, the subcellular location of lethal lipid peroxides remains an outstanding question. Finally, how exactly lipid peroxidation leads to cell death is an unsolved mystery. Answers to these questions will provide insights into the mechanisms of ferroptotic cell death and associated human diseases, as well as new therapeutic strategies for such diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LCHMnGYG4g0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006203</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Huizhong Feng, Brent R.

Loss- and gain-of-function assays demonstrated that PTEN induced miRNA production by associating with and facilitating the nuclear localization of Drosha-Dgcr8, part of the miRNA-processing complex. Reconstitution of PTEN-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a mutant form of PTEN that does not localize to the nucleus resulted in retention of Drosha-Dgcr8 in the cytoplasm and impaired production of mature miRNAs.

Thus, we identified a regulatory pathway involving nuclear PTEN–mediated miRNA generation that limits the production of MyD88 and thereby limits sepsis-associated mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525203902000</published><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/528/eaai9085?rss=1</link><fingerprint>312b6de0</fingerprint><id>RuJRIXzN26JgDGk9YhlIBfh4YrPi0r+1c4exm9G1IBw=_1631d59998b:2772b1c:4e164c41</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science Signaling current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><updated>1525294800000</updated><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ying Zhang, Pengxiang Qu, Xiaonan Ma, Fang Qiao, Yefei Ma, Suzhu Qing, Yong Zhang, Yongsheng Wang, Wei Cui&lt;/p&gt;
Serum starvation is a routine protocol for synchronizing nuclear donor cells to G0/G1 phase during somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, abrupt serum deprivation can cause serious stress to the cells cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, which might result in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, chromosome damage, and finally reduce the success rate of SCNT. In the present study, the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an effective ER stress-relieving drug, on the nuclear donor cells under serum deprivation condition as well as following SCNT procedures were first assessed in the bovine. The results showed that TUDCA significantly reduced ER stress and cell apoptosis in those nuclear donor cells. Moreover, it significantly decreased the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt;, and increased the level of H3K9 acetylation in nuclear donor cells compared with control group. SCNT reconstructed embryos cloned from TUDCA-treated donor cells showed significantly higher fusion, cleavage, blastocyst formation rate, total cell number in day 7 blastocysts, and lower apoptotic index than that from control group. In addition, the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bax&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in blastocysts derived from TUDCA-treated donor cells than that from control group. In conclusion, TUDCA significantly reduced the ER stress of nuclear donor cells under serum starvation condition, and significantly improved the developmental competence of following SCNT reconstructed embryos when these TUDCA-treated cells were used as the nuclear donors.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196785</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress of nuclear donor cells under serum starvation</title><author><name>Ying Zhang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196785</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ying Zhang, Pengxiang Qu, Xiaonan Ma, Fang Qiao, Yefei Ma, Suzhu Qing, Yong Zhang, Yongsheng Wang, Wei Cui&lt;/p&gt;

Advanced graphics capabilities have enabled the use of virtual reality as an efficient design technique. The integration of virtual reality in the design phase still faces impediment because of issues linked to the integration of CAD and virtual reality software. A set of empirical tests using the selected conversion parameters was found to yield properly represented virtual reality models. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 72.71% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 86.64%, indicating that 86.64% of the response variability can be explained by the model. The R-sq (pred) is 67.45%, which is not very high, indicating that the model should be further reduced by eliminating insignificant terms. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 73.32% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 79.49%, indicating that 79.49% of the response variability can be explained by the model. Using the optimization software MODE Frontier (Optimization, MOGA-II, 2014), four types of response surfaces for the three considered response variables were tested for the data of DOE. The parameter values obtained using the proposed experimental design methodology result in better graphics quality, and other necessary design attributes.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197673</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>A systematic approach to parameter selection for CAD-virtual reality data translation using response surface methodology and MOGA-II</title><author><name>Mustufa Haider Abidi</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197673</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mustufa Haider Abidi, Abdulrahman Al-Ahmari, Ali Ahmad&lt;/p&gt;

While previous work has shown that the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification is a useful, though subjective, feature for predicting surgical outcomes, obtaining this classification requires a clinician to review the patient&apos;s medical records. Our goal here is to create an improved risk score using electronic medical records and demonstrate its utility in predicting in-hospital mortality without requiring clinician-derived ASA scores. Methods: Data from 49,513 surgical patients were used to train logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted tree classifiers for predicting in-hospital mortality. The features used are readily available before surgery from EMR databases. A gradient boosted tree regression model was trained to impute the ASA Physical Status Classification, and this new, imputed score was included as an additional feature to preoperatively predict in-hospital post-surgical mortality. The preoperative risk prediction was then used as an input feature to a deep neural network (DNN), along with intraoperative features, to predict postoperative in-hospital mortality risk. Performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: We found that the random forest classifier (AUC 0.921, 95%CI 0.908-0.934) outperforms logistic regression (AUC 0.871, 95%CI 0.841-0.900) and gradient boosted trees (AUC 0.897, 95%CI 0.881-0.912) in predicting in-hospital post-surgical mortality. Using logistic regression, the ASA Physical Status Classification score alone had an AUC of 0.865 (95%CI 0.848-0.882). Adding preoperative features to the ASA Physical Status Classification improved the random forest AUC to 0.929 (95%CI 0.915-0.943). Using only automatically obtained preoperative features with no clinician intervention, we found that the random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.921 (95%CI 0.908-0.934). Integrating the preoperative risk prediction into the DNN for postoperative risk prediction results in an AUC of 0.924 (95%CI 0.905-0.941), and with both a preoperative and postoperative risk score for each patient, we were able to show that the mortality risk changes over time. Conclusions: Features easily extracted from EMR data can be used to preoperatively predict the risk of in-hospital post-surgical mortality in a fully automated fashion, with accuracy comparable to models trained on features that require clinical expertise. This preoperative risk score can then be compared to the postoperative risk score to show that the risk changes, and therefore should be monitored longitudinally over time.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329813v1?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/25/329813</canonicalUrl><title>Preoperative predictions of in-hospital mortality using electronic medical record data [NEW RESULTS]</title><author><name>Hill, B.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329813v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Predicting preoperative in-hospital mortality using readily-available electronic medical record (EMR) data can aid clinicians in accurately and rapidly determining surgical risk.

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006175</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Hyun Bak, Seogjoo J.

Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Ji Hyun Bak</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bABG40KQDFw/article</href></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><published>1526936400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006175</link><fingerprint>9868ed43</fingerprint><title>Implications for human odor sensing revealed from the statistics of odorant-receptor interactions</title><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16383cd4876:d8bafb:abeb7260</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25373-0</href></item></canonical><crawled>1525857424276</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25373-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25373-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/z4PjGy_IqyQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25373-0</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b</title><author><name>Khalid Sossey-Alaoui</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/z4PjGy_IqyQ/s41598-018-25373-0</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25373-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25373-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/z4PjGy_IqyQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525849200000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25373-0</link><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25373-0/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25373_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><width>496</width></visual><fingerprint>f233e238</fingerprint><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16344309394:9a540e:3dd877af</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><updated>1526418000000</updated><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinju Ma, Liyi Ma, Hong Zhang, Zhongquan Zhang, Youqiong Wang, Kai Li, Xiaoming Chen&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The rapid and high-yield method has great potential for commercial manufacturing of policosanol.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197343</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Policosanol fabrication from insect wax and optimization by response surface methodology</title><author><name>Jinju Ma</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197343</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinju Ma, Liyi Ma, Hong Zhang, Zhongquan Zhang, Youqiong Wang, Kai Li, Xiaoming Chen&lt;/p&gt;

The cost of specialized scientific equipment can be high and with limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso- and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term ‘superlamellae consolidation’ to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of &gt;99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197999</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Open-source micro-tensile testers via additive manufacturing for the mechanical characterization of thin films and papers</title><author><name>Krishanu Nandy</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197999</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Krishanu Nandy, David W.

Infection experiments are critical for understanding wildlife disease dynamics. Although infection experiments are typically designed to reduce complexity, disease outcomes still result from complex interactions between host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Cryptic variation across factors can lead to decreased repeatability of infection experiments within and between research groups and hinder research progress. Furthermore, studies with unexpected results are often relegated to the “file drawer” and potential insights gained from these experimental outcomes are lost. Here, we report unexpected results from an infection experiment studying the response of two differentially-susceptible but related frogs (American Bullfrog &lt;i&gt;Rana catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; and the Mountain yellow-legged frog &lt;i&gt;Rana muscosa&lt;/i&gt;) to the amphibian-killing chytrid fungus (&lt;i&gt;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&lt;/i&gt;, Bd). Despite well-documented differences in susceptibility between species, we found no evidence for antibody-mediated immune response and no Bd-related mortality in either species. Additionally, during the study, the sham-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; control group became unexpectedly Bd-positive. We used a custom genotyping assay to demonstrate that the aberrantly-infected &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; carried a Bd genotype distinct from the inoculation genotype. Thus &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; individuals were acquired with low-intensity infections that could not be detected with qPCR. In the Bd-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; treatment group, the inoculated genotype appeared to out-compete the cryptic infection. Thus, our results provide insight into Bd coinfection dynamics, a phenomenon that is increasingly relevant as different pathogen strains are moved around the globe. Our experiment highlights how unexpected experimental outcomes can serve as both cautionary tales and opportunities to explore unanswered research questions. We use our results as a case study to highlight common sources of anomalous results for infection experiments. We argue that understanding these factors will aid researchers in the design, execution, and interpretation of experiments to understand wildlife disease processes.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196851</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Opening the file drawer: Unexpected insights from a chytrid infection experiment</title><author><name>Allison Q.

Here, we report unexpected results from an infection experiment studying the response of two differentially-susceptible but related frogs (American Bullfrog &lt;i&gt;Rana catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; and the Mountain yellow-legged frog &lt;i&gt;Rana muscosa&lt;/i&gt;) to the amphibian-killing chytrid fungus (&lt;i&gt;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&lt;/i&gt;, Bd). Despite well-documented differences in susceptibility between species, we found no evidence for antibody-mediated immune response and no Bd-related mortality in either species. Additionally, during the study, the sham-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; control group became unexpectedly Bd-positive. We used a custom genotyping assay to demonstrate that the aberrantly-infected &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; carried a Bd genotype distinct from the inoculation genotype. Thus &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; individuals were acquired with low-intensity infections that could not be detected with qPCR. In the Bd-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; treatment group, the inoculated genotype appeared to out-compete the cryptic infection. Thus, our results provide insight into Bd coinfection dynamics, a phenomenon that is increasingly relevant as different pathogen strains are moved around the globe. Our experiment highlights how unexpected experimental outcomes can serve as both cautionary tales and opportunities to explore unanswered research questions. We use our results as a case study to highlight common sources of anomalous results for infection experiments. We argue that understanding these factors will aid researchers in the design, execution, and interpretation of experiments to understand wildlife disease processes.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525899600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196851</link><fingerprint>54d76600</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed3:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196851</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00059</href></item></canonical><crawled>1525453493510</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00059/20180503/images/medium/ct-2018-00059c_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00059&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

MPOD values (mean MPOD, maximum MPOD, MPOD area, and MPOD volume) were measured in a range of 4°–7° of eccentricity around the fovea, using the one-wavelength reflectometry method (Visucam 200, Carl-Zeiss Meditec). Patients affected by iERM and FTMH were treated with vitrectomy and epiretinal membrane-inner limiting membrane (ERM-ILM) peeling, with follow-up examinations performed preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. The main outcome measures were the differences in MPOD between eyes with vitreoretinal interface syndrome and healthy eyes, changes in MPOD after ERM-ILM peeling, and relationships between MPOD and functional changes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean MPOD differed significantly between control eyes and those with iERM (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .0001) or FTMH (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .0006). The max MPOD and MPOD area increased, but not significantly. After peeling, the only significant change in MPOD was in MPOD volume (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .01).

Primary brain microvessels (BrMV) maintain the cellular characters and molecular signatures as displayed in vivo, and serve as a vital tool for biomedical research of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the development/optimization of brain drug delivery. The variations of relative purities or cellular composition among different BrMV samples may have significant consequences in data interpretation and research outcome, especially for experiments with high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable reference gene (RG) for accurate normalization of real-time RT-qPCR analysis, and determine the proper marker genes (MG) for relative purity assessment in BrMV samples. Out of five housekeeping genes, β-actin was selected as the most suitable RG that was validated by quantifying mRNA levels of alpha-L-iduronidase in BrMV isolated from mice with one or two expressing alleles. Four marker genes highly/selectively expressed in BBB-forming capillary endothelial cells were evaluated by RT-qPCR for purity assessment, resulting in &lt;i&gt;Cldn&lt;/i&gt;5 and &lt;i&gt;Pecam1&lt;/i&gt; as most suitable MGs that were further confirmed by immunofluorescent analysis of cellular components. &lt;i&gt;Plvap&lt;/i&gt; proved to be an indicator gene for the presence of fenestrated vessels in BrMV samples.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To facilitate precise local ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a setting of combined ablation and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), we evaluated accuracy and efficiency of a novel technique for navigated positioning of ablation probes using intrahepatic tumor referencing and electromagnetic (EM) guidance, in a porcine model.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An angiographic wire with integrated EM reference sensor at its tip was inserted via a transarterial femoral access and positioned in the vicinity of artificial liver tumors. The resulting offset distance between the tumor center and the intrahepatic endovascular EM reference was calculated. Subsequently, EM tracked ablation probes were inserted percutaneously and navigated toward the tumor center, relying on continuous EM guidance via the intrahepatic reference. Targeting accuracy was assessed as the Euclidean distance between the tip of the ablation probe and the tumor center (Target Positioning Error, TPE). Procedural efficiency was assessed as time efforts for tumor referencing and tumor targeting.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In 6 animals, 124 targeting measurements were performed with an offset distance &amp;lt; 30 mm (clinically most feasible position), resulting in a mean TPE of 2.9 ± 1.6 mm. No significant correlation between the TPE and different intrahepatic offset distances (range 21 to 61 mm, n = 365) was shown as long as the EM reference was placed within the liver. However, the mean TPE increased when placing the EM reference externally on the animal skin (p &amp;lt; 0.01). TPE was similar when targeting under continuous ventilation or in apnea (p = 0.50). Mean time for tumor referencing and navigated targeting was 6.5 ± 3.8 minutes and 14 ± 8 seconds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The proposed technique allows precise and efficient navigated positioning of ablation probes into liver tumors in the animal model.

Dairy farming is one the most important sectors of United Kingdom (UK) agriculture. It faces major challenges due to climate change, which will have direct impacts on dairy cows as a result of heat stress. In the absence of adaptations, this could potentially lead to considerable milk loss. Using an 11-member climate projection ensemble, as well as an ensemble of 18 milk loss estimation methods, temporal changes in milk production of UK dairy cows were estimated for the 21st century at a 25 km resolution in a spatially-explicit way. While increases in UK temperatures are projected to lead to relatively low average annual milk losses, even for southern UK regions (&amp;lt;180 kg/cow), the ‘hottest’ 25×25 km grid cell in the hottest year in the 2090s, showed an annual milk loss exceeding 1300 kg/cow. This figure represents approximately 17% of the potential milk production of today’s average cow. Despite the potential considerable inter-annual variability of annual milk loss, as well as the large differences between the climate projections, the variety of calculation methods is likely to introduce even greater uncertainty into milk loss estimations. To address this issue, a novel, more biologically-appropriate mechanism of estimating milk loss is proposed that provides more realistic future projections. We conclude that South West England is the region most vulnerable to climate change economically, because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore potentially high heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach £13.4M in average years and £33.8M in extreme years.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197076</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Spatially explicit estimation of heat stress-related impacts of climate change on the milk production of dairy cows in the United Kingdom</title><author><name>Nándor Fodor</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197076</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nándor Fodor, Andreas Foskolos, Cairistiona F.

Several studies have reported regulatory effects of estrogens on fear conditioning in female rodents. However, these studies used different doses, durations, and/or administration methods, and reported inconsistent results. To clarify the effect of estrogen on fear conditioning, we investigated the effects of different doses and durations of estradiol administration on freezing behavior during contextual fear conditioning in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In Experiment 1, OVX ICR mice received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of either oil vehicle (control, 0.1 ml sesame oil) or varied doses (0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, or 50 μg/0.1 ml) of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB). Fear conditioning was conducted two days post-EB treatment, and the mice were tested for the learned fear response the following day. In Experiment 2, OVX female mice received an s.c. implantation of a Silastic capsule (I.D. 1.98 × 20.0 mm) containing either vehicle or varied doses (0.05 μg/0.1 ml, 0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, 50 μg/0.1 ml) of EB. Two weeks after implantation, fear conditioning was conducted. During the tests conducted 24 h after conditioning, the high dose EB group showed longer freezing times in both experiments, and lower locomotor activity compared to the control or lower dose groups. In Experiment 3, serum estradiol concentrations of the mice that were treated like those in Experiment 2, were measured; the serum levels of estradiol increased linearly according to the dose of EB administered. The results suggest that mice treated with a high dose of EB exhibit enhanced fear learning, regardless of treatment duration. As a woman’s vulnerability to emotional disorders increases in the peripregnancy period, during which estrogen levels are high, the results from the high-dose EB groups may be important for understanding the hormonal mechanisms involved in these disorders.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197441</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>The enhancement effect of estradiol on contextual fear conditioning in female mice</title><author><name>Yui K.

Mouse models of breast cancer with specific molecular subtypes (e.g., ER or HER2 positive) in an immunocompetent or an immunocompromised environment significantly contribute to our understanding of cancer biology, despite some limitations, and they give insight into targeted therapies.

Mouse models of breast cancer with specific molecular subtypes (e.g., ER or HER2 positive) in an immunocompetent or an immunocompromised environment significantly contribute to our understanding of cancer biology, despite some limitations, and they give insight into targeted therapies. However, an ideal triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse model is lacking. What has been missing in the TNBC mouse model is a sequential progression of the disease in an essential native microenvironment. This notion inspired us to develop a TNBC-model in syngeneic mice using a mammary intraductal (MIND) method. To achieve this goal, Mvt-1and 4T1 TNBC mouse cell lines were injected into the mammary ducts via nipples of FVB/N mice and BALB/c wild-type immunocompetent mice, respectively.

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196984</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>First record of &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; formation of ectomycorrhizae in &amp;lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&amp;lt;/i&gt; Sabine, a native Myrtaceae of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest</title><author><name>Cassio Geremia Freire</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196984</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;

We have developed our original tissue engineering technology “cell sheet engineering” utilizing temperature-responsive culture dishes. The cells are confluently grown on a temperature-responsive culture dish and can be harvested as a cell sheet by lowering temperature without enzymatic digestion. Cell sheets are high-cell-density tissues similar to actual living tissues, maintaining their structure and function. Based on this “cell sheet engineering”, we are trying to create functional cardiac tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cells, for regenerative therapy and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing. Toward this purpose, it is necessary to evaluate the contractility of engineered cardiac cell sheets. Therefore, in the present study, we developed a contractile force measurement system and evaluated the contractility of human iPSC-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissues. By attaching the cardiac cell sheets on fibrin gel sheets, we created dynamically beating cardiac cell sheet-tissues. They were mounted to the force measurement system and the contractile force was measured stably and clearly. The absolute values of contractile force were around 1 mN, and the mean force value per cross-sectional area was 3.3 mN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These values are equivalent to or larger than many previously reported values, indicating the functionality of our engineered cardiac cell sheets. We also confirmed that both the contractile force and beating rate were significantly increased by the administration of adrenaline, which are the physiologically relevant responses for cardiac tissues. In conclusion, the force measurement system developed in the present study is valuable for the evaluation of engineered cardiac cell sheet-tissues, and for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing as well.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198026</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Contractile force measurement of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissue</title><author><name>Daisuke Sasaki</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198026</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daisuke Sasaki, Katsuhisa Matsuura, Hiroyoshi Seta, Yuji Haraguchi, Teruo Okano, Tatsuya Shimizu&lt;/p&gt;

The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a main regulator of cell survival, proliferation, motility, and platelet aggregation, and it is essential for angiogenesis and lymphocyte trafficking. In that S1P acts as a second messenger intra- and extracellularly, it might promote cancer progression. The main cause is found in the high S1P concentration in the blood, which encourage cancer cells to migrate through the endothelial barrier into the blood vessels. The irreversible degradation of S1P is solely caused by the sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1). SGPL1 overexpression reduces cancer cell migration and therefore silences the endogenous S1P siren, which promotes cancer cell attraction—the main reason for metastasis. Since our previous metabolomics studies revealed an increased SGPL1 activity in association with successful breast cancer cell treatment &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, we further investigated expression and localization of SGPL1. Expression analyses confirmed a very low SGPL1 expression in all breast cancer samples, regardless of their subtype. Additionally, we were able to prove a novel SGPL expression in the cytoplasm membrane of non-tumorigenic breast cells by fusing three independent methods. The general SGPL1 downregulation and the loss of the plasma membrane expression resulted in S1P dependent stimulation of migration in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT-20. Not only S1P stimulated migration could be repressed by overexpressing the natural SGPL1 variant not but also more general migratory activity was significantly reduced. Here, for the first time, we report on the SGPL1 plasma membrane location in human, non-malignant breast epithelial cell lines silencing the extracellular S1P siren &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and thereby regulating pivotal cellular functions. Loss of this plasma membrane distribution as well as low SGPL1 expression levels could be a potential prognostic marker and a viable target for therapy. Therefore, the precise role of SGPL1 for cancer treatment should be evaluated.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196854</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>First evidence of SGPL1 expression in the cell membrane silencing the extracellular S1P siren in mammary epithelial cells</title><author><name>Nadja Engel</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196854</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nadja Engel, Anna Adamus, Marcus Frank, Karin Kraft, Juliane Kühn, Petra Müller, Barbara Nebe, Annika Kasten, Guido Seitz&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The annual increase in costs and the quality of life of survivors of cardiac arrest are major concerns. This study used National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to evaluate the 1-year survival rate and the annual healthcare costs of survivors after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective, fixed-cohort study conducted from 2006 to 2012, involved 2 million individuals randomly selected from the NHIRD of Taiwan. Adult patients at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with cardiac arrest were enrolled. Survival was followed up for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 2,256 patients were enrolled. The survivor cohort accounted for 4% (89/2256) of the study population. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the survival and non-survival cohorts, with the exceptions of gender (male: survival vs. non-survival, 50.6% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.007), diabetes mellitus (49.4% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.009), and acute coronary syndrome (44.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.010). Only 38 (1.7%) patients survived for &gt; 1 year. The mean re-admission to hospital during the 1-year follow up was 73.5 (SD: 110.2) days. The mean healthcare cost during the 1-year follow up was $12,953. Factors associated with total healthcare costs during the 1-year follow up were as follows: city or county of residence, being widowed, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (city or county of residence, β: -23,604, p &amp;lt; 0.001; being widowed, β: 25,588, p = 0.049; COPD, β: 14,438, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a great burden of the annual healthcare costs of survivors of cardiac arrest. Socioeconomic status and comorbidity were major confounders of costs. The outcome measures of cardiac arrest should extend beyond the death, and encompass destitution.

In this work, we explore the idea of gene embedding, distributed representation of genes, in the spirit of word embedding. Methods &amp;amp; Results: From a pure data-driven fashion, we trained a 200-dimension vector representation of all human genes, using gene co-expression patterns in 984 data sets from the GEO databases. These vectors capture functional relatedness of genes in terms of recovering known pathways - the average inner product (similarity) of genes within a pathway is 1.52X greater than that of random genes. Using t-SNE, we produced a gene co-expression map that shows local concentrations of tissue specific genes. We also illustrated the usefulness of the embedded gene vectors, laden with rich information on gene co-expression patterns, in tasks such as gene-gene interaction prediction. Conclusions: We proposed a machine learning method that utilizes transcriptome-wide gene co-expression to generate a distributed representation of genes. We further demonstrated the utility of our distribution by predicting gene-gene interaction based solely on gene names. The distributed representation of genes could be useful for more bioinformatics applications.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286096v2?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/19/286096</canonicalUrl><title>Gene2Vec: Distributed Representation of Genes Based on Co-Expression [NEW RESULTS]</title><author><name>Du, J.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286096v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Existing functional description of genes are categorical, discrete, and mostly through manual process.

These vectors capture functional relatedness of genes in terms of recovering known pathways - the average inner product (similarity) of genes within a pathway is 1.52X greater than that of random genes. Using t-SNE, we produced a gene co-expression map that shows local concentrations of tissue specific genes. We also illustrated the usefulness of the embedded gene vectors, laden with rich information on gene co-expression patterns, in tasks such as gene-gene interaction prediction. Conclusions: We proposed a machine learning method that utilizes transcriptome-wide gene co-expression to generate a distributed representation of genes. We further demonstrated the utility of our distribution by predicting gene-gene interaction based solely on gene names. The distributed representation of genes could be useful for more bioinformatics applications.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526713200000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286096v2?rss=1</link><fingerprint>a6ff36a6</fingerprint><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16379cacee6:5b0d565:93d646dc</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/504-e?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/504.5.full</canonicalUrl><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33b85:3dd877af</id><author><name>McCartney, M.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/504-e?rss=1</href></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><published>1525369184000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/504-e?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>d126ec82</fingerprint><title>You can&apos;t be what you can&apos;t see</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/588?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/588.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7f2:93d646dc</id><author><name>Garber, K.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/588?rss=1</href></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><published>1525974002000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/588?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>e4bf12ad</fingerprint><title>A new cancer immunotherapy suffers a setback</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><keywords><item>Cell Biology, Medicine, Diseases</item></keywords><engagement>78</engagement></item><item><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00330</href></item></canonical><crawled>1525711448573</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00330/20180507/images/medium/jm-2018-003309_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00330&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Overall, dynamicME and the methods presented provide novel methods for understanding proteome allocation and metabolism under complex and transient environments, and to utilize time-course cell culture data for model-based interpretation or model refinement.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526367600000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319962v1?rss=1</link><fingerprint>f95f1829</fingerprint><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1636478e11d:3887d3e:3dd877af</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/694?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/694.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395df:3dd877af</id><author><name>Cohen, J.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/694?rss=1</href></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><published>1526578752000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/694?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>1ef8bbc9</fingerprint><title>Vaccine trial launched to stop Ebola</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><keywords><item>Epidemiology, Medicine, Diseases, Virology</item></keywords><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><updated>1526072400000</updated><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jenny Farmer, Donald Jacobs&lt;/p&gt;
In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples. Scaled quantile residual plots are also introduced as an effective diagnostic to visualize the quality of the estimated probability densities. Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>High throughput nonparametric probability density estimation</title><author><name>Jenny Farmer</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jenny Farmer, Donald Jacobs&lt;/p&gt;

Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models. Answering “yes” to the screening questions regarding reduced dietary intake and weight loss was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (respectively OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.59, 4.45) and OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.76)). In conclusion, we demonstrate SSI to occur more often among patients at nutritional risk as compared to those who are not at nutritional risk. Future studies should investigate interventions to prevent both SSI and nutritional risk among surgical patients.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197344</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>A positive association between nutritional risk and the incidence of surgical site infections: A hospital-based register study</title><author><name>Eli Skeie</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197344</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eli Skeie, Anne Mette Koch, Stig Harthug, Unni Fosse, Kari Sygnestveit, Roy Miodini Nilsen, Randi J.

Moreover, SRSF3 controls the alternative splicing of the export factor &lt;i&gt;Nxf1&lt;/i&gt; and RNA regulators with established roles in pluripotency, and the steady-state levels of mRNAs encoding chromatin modifiers. Our investigation links molecular events to cellular functions by demonstrating how SRSF3 regulates the pluripotency genes and uncovers SRSF3-RNA interactions as a critical means to coordinate gene expression during reprogramming, stem cell self-renewal and early development.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><keywords><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><engagement>17</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525281531008</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lightwave valleytronics in a monolayer of tungsten diselenide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightwave valleytronics in a monolayer of tungsten diselenide, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0013-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0013-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A strong lightwave in a monolayer of tungsten diselenide drives changes in the valley pseudospin, making valley pseudospin an information carrier that is switchable faster than a single light cycle.</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0013-6</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Lightwave valleytronics in a monolayer of tungsten diselenide</title><author><name>F.

Interventions to enhance mental health and well-being within high risk industries such as the emergency services have typically focused on individual-level factors, though there is increasing interest in the role of organisational-level interventions. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of different aspects of manager support in determining the mental health of ambulance personnel. A cross-sectional survey was completed by ambulance personnel across two Australian states (N = 1,622). Demographics, manager support and mental health measures were assessed. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to determine the explanatory influence of the employee’s perception of the priority management places upon mental health issues (manager psychosocial safety climate) and managers’ observed behaviours (manager behaviour) on employee common mental disorder and well-being within ambulance personnel. Of the 1,622 participants, 123 (7.6%) were found to be suffering from a likely mental disorder. Manager psychosocial safety climate accounted for a significant amount of the variance in levels of employee common mental health disorder symptoms (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01). Manager behaviour had a lesser, but still statistically significant influence upon symptoms of common mental disorder (7% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (10% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.05). The perceived importance management places on mental health and managers’ actual behaviour are related but distinct concepts, and each appears to impact employee mental health. While the overall variance explained by each factor was limited, the fact that each is potentially modifiable makes this finding important and highlights the significance of organisational and team-level interventions to promote employee well-being within emergency services and other high-risk occupations.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197802</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>The importance of manager support for the mental health and well-being of ambulance personnel</title><author><name>Katherine Petrie</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197802</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine Petrie, Aimée Gayed, Bridget T.

Background &lt;p&gt;Elevated testosterone (T) is routinely reported as a marker of hyperandrogenemia in rodent models for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In women with PCOS, elevated serum androstenedione (A4) is associated with more severe phenotypes, including a positive correlation with serum T, DHEAS, free androgen index (FAI), LH, and LH/FSH ratio. Furthermore, A4, along with calculated free T and FAI, was identified as one of the best predictors of PCOS in adult women of all ages (18 to &gt; 50 y).&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to investigate serum A4 levels in early adolescent and young adult prenatally androgenized (PNA) female rats, a model for PCOS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Pregnant rats were injected with 5 mg T daily during gestational days 16–19 (PNA rats, experimental group) or an equal volume of vehicle (control group). Female offspring of both groups had tail vein blood drawn for serum analysis at 8 and 16 weeks of age. ELISAs were used to quantify serum A4 and T levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Serum A4 and T were elevated in 16-week-old PNA rats compared to controls. There was no significant difference in either hormone at 8 weeks of age.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The PNA rats demonstrated elevated serum A4 and T in young adulthood, as has been observed in women with PCOS, further validating this as a model for PCOS and underscoring the importance of serum A4 elevation as a parameter inherent to PCOS and a rodent model for the disorder. Significant A4 elevation develops between early adolescence and early adulthood in this PNA rat model.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196862</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Elevated androstenedione in young adult but not early adolescent prenatally androgenized female rats</title><author><name>Ami B.

Furthermore, A4, along with calculated free T and FAI, was identified as one of the best predictors of PCOS in adult women of all ages (18 to &gt; 50 y).&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to investigate serum A4 levels in early adolescent and young adult prenatally androgenized (PNA) female rats, a model for PCOS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Pregnant rats were injected with 5 mg T daily during gestational days 16–19 (PNA rats, experimental group) or an equal volume of vehicle (control group). Female offspring of both groups had tail vein blood drawn for serum analysis at 8 and 16 weeks of age. ELISAs were used to quantify serum A4 and T levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Serum A4 and T were elevated in 16-week-old PNA rats compared to controls. There was no significant difference in either hormone at 8 weeks of age.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The PNA rats demonstrated elevated serum A4 and T in young adulthood, as has been observed in women with PCOS, further validating this as a model for PCOS and underscoring the importance of serum A4 elevation as a parameter inherent to PCOS and a rodent model for the disorder. Significant A4 elevation develops between early adolescence and early adulthood in this PNA rat model.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525381200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196862</link><fingerprint>27836575</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3ae5:5785ab88</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196862</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><updated>1525899600000</updated><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Kovac, Tomi P.

The controlled formation and stabilization of E-cadherin-based adhesions is vital for epithelial integrity. This requires co-operation between the E-cadherin-based adhesions and the associated actin cytoskeleton. In cancer, this co-operation often fails, predisposing cells to migration through molecular mechanisms that have only been partially characterized. Here, we demonstrate that the actin filament cross-linker α-actinin-1 is frequently increased in human breast cancer. In mammary epithelial cells, the increased α-actinin-1 levels promote cell migration and induce disorganized acini-like structures in Matrigel. This is accompanied by a major reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the associated E-cadherin-based adhesions. Increased expression of α-actinin-1 is particularly noted in basal-like breast cancer cell lines, and in breast cancer patients it associates with poor prognosis in basal-like subtypes. Downregulation of α-actinin-1 in E-cadherin expressing basal-like breast cancer cells demonstrate that α-actinin-1-assembled actin fibers destabilize E-cadherin-based adhesions. Taken together, these results indicate that increased α-actinin-1 expression destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions, which is likely to promote the migratory potential of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our results identify α-actinin-1 as a candidate prognostic biomarker in basal-like breast cancer.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196986</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Increased α-actinin-1 destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions and associates with poor prognosis in basal-like breast cancer</title><author><name>Bianca Kovac</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196986</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Kovac, Tomi P.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a stress-regulating cytokine that was shown to protect the heart from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, but its role in the pathogenesis of AKI remains unknown. In an observational study, serum and urinary MIF was quantified in 60 patients scheduled for elective conventional cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Cardiac surgery triggered an increase in MIF serum concentrations, and patients with high circulating MIF (&gt;median) 12 hours after surgery had a significantly reduced risk of developing AKI (relative risk reduction, 72.7%; 95% confidence interval, 12 to 91.5%; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). Experimental AKI was induced in wild-type and &lt;i&gt;Mif&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice by 30 min of ischemia followed by 6 or 24 hours of reperfusion, or by rhabdomyolysis. &lt;i&gt;Mif&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice exhibited increased tubular cell injury, increased regulated cell death (necroptosis and ferroptosis), and enhanced oxidative stress.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a stress-regulating cytokine that was shown to protect the heart from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, but its role in the pathogenesis of AKI remains unknown. In an observational study, serum and urinary MIF was quantified in 60 patients scheduled for elective conventional cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Cardiac surgery triggered an increase in MIF serum concentrations, and patients with high circulating MIF (&gt;median) 12 hours after surgery had a significantly reduced risk of developing AKI (relative risk reduction, 72.7%; 95% confidence interval, 12 to 91.5%; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). Experimental AKI was induced in wild-type and &lt;i&gt;Mif&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice by 30 min of ischemia followed by 6 or 24 hours of reperfusion, or by rhabdomyolysis. &lt;i&gt;Mif&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice exhibited increased tubular cell injury, increased regulated cell death (necroptosis and ferroptosis), and enhanced oxidative stress. Therapeutic administration of recombinant MIF after ischemia-reperfusion in mice ameliorated AKI. In vitro treatment of tubular epithelial cells with recombinant MIF reduced cell death and oxidative stress as measured by glutathione and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in the setting of hypoxia. Our data provide evidence of a renoprotective role of MIF in experimental ischemia-reperfusion injury by protecting renal tubular epithelial cells, consistent with our observation that high MIF in cardiac surgery patients is associated with a reduced incidence of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526493034000</published><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/441/eaan4886?rss=1</link><fingerprint>fe4a0d2</fingerprint><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1636a23b7f9:4205be2:3dd877af</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin><engagement>8</engagement></item><item><crawled>1526981725661</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5027063?af=R</originId><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Efficient Brownian Dynamics of rigid colloids in linear flow fields based on the grand mobility matrix</title><author><name>Duraivelan Palanisamy</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5027063?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/19&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 19&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526874117000</published><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5027063?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>bb5c70e4</fingerprint><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16387340ddd:6c08797:93d646dc</id><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525205300057</crawled><description>The LTR retrotransposon Steamer is a selfish endogenous element in the soft-shell clam genome that was first detected because of its dramatic amplification in bivalve transmissible neoplasia afflicting the species.

Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-protein complexes in a number of bacterial pathogens that can translocate proteins and DNA to the host. Most T4SSs function in conjugation and translocate DNA; however, approximately 13% function to secrete proteins, delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. Upon entry, these effectors manipulate the host cell’s machinery for their own benefit, which can result in serious illness or death of the host. For this reason recognition of T4SS effectors has become an important subject. Much previous work has focused on verifying effectors experimentally, a costly endeavor in terms of money, time, and effort. Having good predictions for effectors will help to focus experimental validations and decrease testing costs. In recent years, several scoring and machine learning-based methods have been suggested for the purpose of predicting T4SS effector proteins. These methods have used different sets of features for prediction, and their predictions have been inconsistent. In this paper, an optimal set of features is presented for predicting T4SS effector proteins using a statistical approach. A thorough literature search was performed to find features that have been proposed. Feature values were calculated for datasets of known effectors and non-effectors for T4SS-containing pathogens for four genera with a sufficient number of known effectors, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp, and &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. The features were ranked, and less important features were filtered out. Correlations between remaining features were removed, and dimensional reduction was accomplished using principal component analysis and factor analysis. Finally, the optimal features for each pathogen were chosen by building logistic regression models and evaluating each model. The results based on evaluation of our logistic regression models confirm the effectiveness of our four optimal sets of features, and based on these an optimal set of features is proposed for all T4SS effector proteins.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>An optimal set of features for predicting type IV secretion system effector proteins for a subset of species based on a multi-level feature selection approach</title><author><name>Zhila Esna Ashari</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhila Esna Ashari, Nairanjana Dasgupta, Kelly A.

Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; dominant pathway for ligand binding.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v22HP1dNVjw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jagannath Mondal, Navjeet Ahalawat, Subhendu Pandit, Lewis E.

Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; dominant pathway for ligand binding.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v22HP1dNVjw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jagannath Mondal</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/v22HP1dNVjw/article</href></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><published>1526677200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</link><fingerprint>43541b1d</fingerprint><title>Atomic resolution mechanism of ligand binding to a solvent inaccessible cavity in T4 lysozyme</title><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163745f3b6c:1321:910a81bb</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><recrawled>1527264107827</recrawled><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/865-b?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/865.2.full</canonicalUrl><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce958:3dd877af</id><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/865-b?rss=1</href></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><published>1527183688000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/865-b?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>840f21a6</fingerprint><title>NextGen VOICES: Submit Now: Broad interests: Benefits for science</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><updated>1525294800000</updated><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197013</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Correction: Positive cytoplasmic UCHL5 tumor expression in gastric cancer is linked to improved prognosis</title><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197013</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525294800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197013</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>1c242bb4</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a19b:93d646dc</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197013</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525954497829</crawled><description>Forebrain precursor cells are dynamic during early brain development, yet the underlying molecular changes remain elusive.

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006068</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan E.

A growing literature has been developed demonstrating the clinical relevance of a biomathematical model, the Proliferation-Invasion (PI) model, of glioblastoma growth.

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a serious complication during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Currently, the diagnosis of CI-AKI relies on serum creatinine (SCr) that is however affected by several limitations potentially leading to delayed or missed diagnoses. In this study we examined the diagnostic accuracy of a “bedside” measurement of plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) in the early detection of CI-AKI in 97 patients undergoing elective PCI. The overall incidence of CI-AKI was 3%. A significant positive correlation was observed between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI SCr (r = 0.339, p = 0.004) and a significant negative correlation between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI CrCl (r = -0.303, p = 0.010). In patients with post-PCI SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl (median SCr absolute increase), delta NGAL 0–6 hours and 6-hours NGAL values were higher compared with patients with SCr elevation below the defined threshold (p = 0.049 and p = 0.056). The ROC analysis showed that a 6 hours NGAL value &gt; 96 ng/ml significantly predicted an absolute SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl after contrast exposure with sensitivity of 53% and specificity of 74% (AUC 0.819, 95% CI: 0.656 to 0.983, p = 0.005). The use of bedside NGAL assessment may significantly hasten diagnosis and treatment of CI-AKI, with remarkable clinical prognostic consequences.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197833</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Early prediction of contrast-induced acute kidney injury by a &quot;bedside&quot; assessment of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin during elective percutaneous coronary interventions</title><author><name>Annunziata Nusca</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197833</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Annunziata Nusca, Marco Miglionico, Claudio Proscia, Laura Ragni, Massimiliano Carassiti, Francesca Lassandro Pepe, Germano Di Sciascio&lt;/p&gt;

Measuring red blood cell (RBC) deformability has become important for clinical disease diagnostics. Various methods for measuring RBC deformability have been developed; however, they require costly and large instruments, long measuring time, and skilled personnel. In this study, we present a three-dimensional-printed mini-disk (3D-PMD) for measuring RBC deformability to overcome the previous limitations. For a miniaturized and low-cost setup, the 3D-PMD was fabricated by a 3D printing technique, which had not yet been used for fabricating a lab-on-a-compact disk (LOCD). Using a 3D printing technique, a multi-layered fluidic channel on the mini CD could be fabricated easily. During rotation by a spinning motor, the difference of the length of compressed RBCs in the fluidic channel was measured and analysed as compressibility indices (CIs) of normal and glutaraldehyde-treated hardened RBCs. The rotation speed and time were decided as 3000 rpm and 30 min, respectively, at which the difference of CI values between normal and hardened RBCs was largest (CI&lt;sub&gt;normal&lt;/sub&gt;-CI&lt;sub&gt;hardened&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.195).</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197619</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Determination of red blood cell deformability using centrifugal force in a three-dimensional-printed mini-disk (3D-PMD)</title><author><name>Hyunjung Lim</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197619</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunjung Lim, Seung Min Back, Jeonghun Nam, Hyuk Choi&lt;/p&gt;

The P8 stem-loop region of the &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L intron, which is known to be hypervariable in size with multiple repeat motifs and created difficulties in alignment, is always excluded in phylogenetic as well as barcode analyses. This region was investigated for species discrimination in 98 taxa of orchids belonging to the tribe Vandeae using in silico mapping of restriction site polymorphism. The length of the P8 regions varied from 200 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Aerides rosea&lt;/i&gt; to 669 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Dendrophylax sallei&lt;/i&gt;. Forty two taxa had unique lengths, while as many as eight shared a common length of 521 nucleotides. Of the 35 restriction endonucleases producing digestions in the P8 regions, three, viz., &lt;i&gt;Ags&lt;/i&gt;I, &lt;i&gt;Apo&lt;/i&gt;I and &lt;i&gt;Tsp&lt;/i&gt;DTI turned out to have recognition sites across all the 98 taxa being studied. When their restriction data were combined, 92 taxa could be discriminated leaving three taxon pairs. However, &lt;i&gt;Acampe papillosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aeranthes arachnites&lt;/i&gt; despite having similar restriction sites differed in their P8 lengths.

Background &lt;p&gt;Almost all medical journals now require authors to publicly disclose conflicts of interests (COI). The same standard and scrutiny is rarely employed for the editors of the journals although COI may affect editorial decisions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective observational study to determine the prevalence and magnitude of financial relationships among editors of 60 influential US medical journals (10 each for internal medicine and five subspecialties: cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, dermatology and allergy &amp;amp; immunology). Open Payments database was reviewed to determine the percentage of physician editors receiving payments and the nature and amount of these payments.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;703 unique physician editors were included in our analysis. 320/703 (46%) received 8659 general payments totaling $8,120,562.

Background &lt;p&gt;Almost all medical journals now require authors to publicly disclose conflicts of interests (COI). The same standard and scrutiny is rarely employed for the editors of the journals although COI may affect editorial decisions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective observational study to determine the prevalence and magnitude of financial relationships among editors of 60 influential US medical journals (10 each for internal medicine and five subspecialties: cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, dermatology and allergy &amp;amp; immunology). Open Payments database was reviewed to determine the percentage of physician editors receiving payments and the nature and amount of these payments.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;703 unique physician editors were included in our analysis. 320/703 (46%) received 8659 general payments totaling $8,120,562. The median number of payments per editor was 9 (IQR 3–26) and the median amount per payment was $91 (IQR $21–441). The median total payment received by each editor in one year was $4,364 (IQR $319–23,143). 152 (48%) editors received payments more than $5,000 in a year, a threshold considered significant by the National Institutes of Health. COI policies for editors were available for 34/60 (57%) journals but only 7/34 (21%) publicly reported the disclosures and only 2 (3.%) reported the dollar amount received.&lt;/p&gt; Interpretation &lt;p&gt;A significant number of editors of internal medicine and subspecialty medical journals have financial COI and very few are publicly disclosed. Specialty journal editors have more COI compared to general medicine journal editors. Current policies for disclosing COI for editors are inconsistent and do not comply with the recommended standards.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526677200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197141</link><fingerprint>c119da2c</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721b:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197141</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12450</href></item></canonical><crawled>1525868462206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b12450/20180509/images/medium/jp-2017-124503_0013.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12450&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Dynamic models in disease ecology have historically evaluated vaccination strategies under the assumption that they are implemented homogeneously in space and time. However, this approach fails to formally account for operational and logistical constraints inherent in the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk. Thus, feedback between the dynamic processes of vaccine distribution and transmission might be overlooked. Here, we present a spatially explicit, stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated model that highlights the density-dependence and spatial constraints of various diffusive strategies of vaccination during an outbreak. The model integrates an agent-based process of disease spread with a partial differential process of vaccination deployment. We characterize the vaccination response in terms of a diffusion rate that describes the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk from a central location. This generates an explicit trade-off between slow diffusion, which concentrates effort near the central location, and fast diffusion, which spreads a fixed vaccination effort thinly over a large area. We use stochastic simulation to identify the optimum vaccination diffusion rate as a function of population density, interaction scale, transmissibility, and vaccine intensity. Our results show that, conditional on a timely response, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size is to distribute vaccination resource at an intermediate rate: fast enough to outpace the epidemic, but slow enough to achieve local herd immunity. If the response is delayed, however, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size changes to a rapidly diffusive distribution of vaccination effort. The latter may also result in significantly larger outbreaks, thus suggesting a benefit of allocating resources to timely outbreak detection and response.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0yJKQdlBIFk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006161</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yun Tao, Katriona Shea, Matthew Ferrari&lt;/p&gt;

Sleep science is entering a new era, thanks to new data-driven analysis approaches that, combined with mouse gene–editing technologies, show a promise in functional genomics and translational research. However, the investigation of sleep is time consuming and not suitable for large-scale phenotypic datasets, mainly due to the need for subjective manual annotations of electrophysiological states. Moreover, the heterogeneous nature of sleep, with all its physiological aspects, is not fully accounted for by the current system of sleep stage classification. In this study, we present a new data-driven analysis approach offering a plethora of novel features for the characterization of sleep. This novel approach allowed for identifying several substages of sleep that were hidden to standard analysis. For each of these substages, we report an independent set of homeostatic responses following sleep deprivation. By using our new substages classification, we have identified novel differences among various genetic backgrounds. Moreover, in a specific experiment with the &lt;i&gt;Zfhx3&lt;/i&gt; mouse line, a recent circadian mutant expressing both shortening of the circadian period and abnormal sleep architecture, we identified specific sleep states that account for genotypic differences at specific times of the day. These results add a further level of interaction between circadian clock and sleep homeostasis and indicate that dissecting sleep in multiple states is physiologically relevant and can lead to the discovery of new links between sleep phenotypes and genetic determinants. Therefore, our approach has the potential to significantly enhance the understanding of sleep physiology through the study of single mutations. Moreover, this study paves the way to systematic high-throughput analyses of sleep.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bBGe8ybdGnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003663</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vasiliki-Maria Katsageorgiou, Diego Sona, Matteo Zanotto, Glenda Lassi, Celina Garcia-Garcia, Valter Tucci, Vittorio Murino&lt;/p&gt;

Moreover, this study paves the way to systematic high-throughput analyses of sleep.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bBGe8ybdGnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Vasiliki-Maria Katsageorgiou</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/bBGe8ybdGnU/article</href></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><published>1527627600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003663</link><fingerprint>284d5a5d</fingerprint><title>A novel unsupervised analysis of electrophysiological signals reveals new sleep substages in mice</title><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163ad084e4f:123fd5:ed160cc3</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1527063251177</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The global south is rich in sustainability lessons that students deserve to hear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global south is rich in sustainability lessons that students deserve to hear, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05210-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05210-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A Western bias limits progress, so educators must share how communities in the developing world manage environmental change, argues Harini Nagendra.</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05210-0</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>The global south is rich in sustainability lessons that students deserve to hear</title><engagementRate>3.36</engagementRate><author><name>Harini Nagendra</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05210-0</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The global south is rich in sustainability lessons that students deserve to hear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global south is rich in sustainability lessons that students deserve to hear, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05210-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05210-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A Western bias limits progress, so educators must share how communities in the developing world manage environmental change, argues Harini Nagendra.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1527058800000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05210-0</link><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05210-0/d41586-018-05210-0_15767136.jpg</url><height>576</height><width>1024</width></visual><fingerprint>b804da89</fingerprint><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1638c1008e9:73e288b:93d646dc</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>504</engagement></item><item><crawled>1526981725661</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029375?af=R</originId><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Vapor-liquid equilibrium and equation of state of two-dimensional fluids from a discrete perturbation theory</title><author><name>Víctor M.

A common goal in data-analysis is to sift through a large data-matrix and detect any significant submatrices (i.e., biclusters) that have a low numerical rank. We present a simple algorithm for tackling this biclustering problem. Our algorithm accumulates information about 2-by-2 submatrices (i.e., ‘loops’) within the data-matrix, and focuses on rows and columns of the data-matrix that participate in an abundance of low-rank loops. We demonstrate, through analysis and numerical-experiments, that this loop-counting method performs well in a variety of scenarios, outperforming simple spectral methods in many situations of interest. Another important feature of our method is that it can easily be modified to account for aspects of experimental design which commonly arise in practice. For example, our algorithm can be modified to correct for controls, categorical- and continuous-covariates, as well as sparsity within the data. We demonstrate these practical features with two examples; the first drawn from gene-expression analysis and the second drawn from a much larger genome-wide-association-study (GWAS).&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbY469xyEU0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006105</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aaditya V.

While numerous papers have illuminated the worthiness of research collaboration, relatively few have addressed its prerequisites. In our study, seven prerequisites for research collaboration were extracted from the existing literature, and 460 student researchers were surveyed for their perceptions of the prerequisites’ importance. Focusing on voluntary research collaborations rather than brokered ones, it was found that socially oriented prerequisites such as reciprocal interactions, accountability, trust, and equality are perceived of more importance than prerequisites of psychical proximity, networking channels, and funds and material supplies (substance- and entity-related prerequisites). With latent regression analyses, we also found that Chinese and older, more experienced researchers are inclined to stress the importance of equality. Researchers of different cohorts prioritise substance- and entity-related prerequisites disparately. Specifically, Chinese researchers emphasise the necessity of funds, while researchers from first-tier universities place more value on networking channels. Disciplinary differences for the prerequisite of proximity were also discovered. Based on these results, discussion and implications were referred. Further suggestions on research collaboration studies are rendered.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197960</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Student researchers’ perceived prerequisites for voluntary research collaboration in the context of Flemish and Chinese universities</title><author><name>Sisi Li</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197960</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sisi Li, Chang Zhu, Shasha Li&lt;/p&gt;

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF &lt;i&gt;OCT4&lt;/i&gt;, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and to endodermal tumor formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197046</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Generation of hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells from human induced endodermal progenitor cells</title><author><name>Rangarajan Sambathkumar</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197046</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rangarajan Sambathkumar, Renate Akkerman, Sumitava Dastidar, Philip Roelandt, Manoj Kumar, Manmohan Bajaj, Ana Rita Mestre Rosa, Nicky Helsen, Veerle Vanslembrouck, Eric Kalo, Satish Khurana, Jos Laureys, Conny Gysemans, Marijke M.

We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF &lt;i&gt;OCT4&lt;/i&gt;, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and to endodermal tumor formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526072400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197046</link><fingerprint>f5bc41f2</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f71:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197046</canonicalUrl><engagement>159</engagement></item><item><crawled>1526384112930</crawled><description>Although the human gut microbiome plays a prominent role in xenobiotic transformation, most of the genes and enzymes responsible for this metabolism are unknown.

However, RNA catalysis is dependent upon RNA folding, and this yields structures that can block replication of such RNAs. To address this apparent paradox we have re-examined the building blocks used for RNA replication.

However, RNA catalysis is dependent upon RNA folding, and this yields structures that can block replication of such RNAs. To address this apparent paradox we have re-examined the building blocks used for RNA replication. We report RNA-catalysed RNA synthesis on structured templates when using trinucleotide triphosphates (triplets) as substrates, catalysed by a general and accurate triplet polymerase ribozyme that emerged from &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; evolution as a mutualistic RNA heterodimer.

Our findings challenge the feasibility of &apos;shock and kill&apos;, and suggest the need to explore other strategies to control the latent HIV reservoir.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><keywords><item>Microbiology and Infectious Disease</item></keywords><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><updated>1525899600000</updated><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoling Dou, Shingo Shirahata, Hiroki Sugimoto&lt;/p&gt;
Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape. We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Functional clustering of mouse ultrasonic vocalization data</title><author><name>Xiaoling Dou</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoling Dou, Shingo Shirahata, Hiroki Sugimoto&lt;/p&gt;

Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic disorder characterized by an immune-mediated reaction to gluten and a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Currently, the main treatment of CD is represented by adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which determines the resolution of symptoms, and the normalization of the serology and of the duodenal villous atrophy. In the present study, we aimed to identify changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of celiac patients on GFD for at least 2 years, in order to identify novel disease biomarkers and candidate targets for putative therapeutic approaches. Microarray analysis was performed on PBMCs from 17 celiac patients on long-term GFD and 20 healthy controls. We identified 517 annotated genes that were significantly modulated between celiac patients and controls. Significant biological pathways were functionally clustered using the Core Function of Ingenuity System Pathway Analysis (IPA). Intriguingly, despite being on a GFD, celiac patients exhibited a peculiar PBMC profile characterized by an aberrant expression of genes involved in the regulation of immunity, inflammatory response, metabolism, and cell proliferation. Random forest algorithm was then used to validate the prediction ability of core genes as classifiers of the “celiac status”. In conclusion, our study identified a characteristic PBMCs signature profile in clinically asymptomatic celiac patient.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197915</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Identification of peculiar gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of celiac patients on gluten free diet</title><author><name>Moris Sangineto</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197915</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Moris Sangineto, Giusi Graziano, Simona D’Amore, Roberto Salvia, Giuseppe Palasciano, Carlo Sabbà, Michele Vacca, Marica Cariello&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Chromogranin A (CgA) is a plasma biomarker widely used in the follow-up of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). However, its accuracy as a tumor biomarker is relatively low because plasma CgA can increase also in patients with other diseases or in subjects treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), a class of widely-used drugs.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the attempt to identify a more reliable biomarker for NENs, we investigated, by ELISA, the circulating levels of full-length CgA (CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt;) and of various CgA-derived fragments in 17 patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs, 10 healthy controls, and 21 healthy volunteers before and after treatment with PPIs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs showed increased plasma levels of total-CgA and CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-76&lt;/sub&gt; fragment (vasostatin-1, VS-1) compared to controls [median (25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-percentiles); total-CgA: 1.85 nM (1.01–4.28) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.75 nM (0.52–0.89), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004; VS-1: 2.76 nM (1.09–7.10) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.29 nM (0.26–0.32), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, respectively], but not of CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt; or CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-373&lt;/sub&gt; fragment. VS-1 positively correlated with total-CgA (r = 0.65, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The Receiver Operating Characteristic area under the curve was 0.9935 for VS-1 and 0.8824 for total-CgA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.067).

Background &lt;p&gt;Chromogranin A (CgA) is a plasma biomarker widely used in the follow-up of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). However, its accuracy as a tumor biomarker is relatively low because plasma CgA can increase also in patients with other diseases or in subjects treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), a class of widely-used drugs.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the attempt to identify a more reliable biomarker for NENs, we investigated, by ELISA, the circulating levels of full-length CgA (CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt;) and of various CgA-derived fragments in 17 patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs, 10 healthy controls, and 21 healthy volunteers before and after treatment with PPIs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs showed increased plasma levels of total-CgA and CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-76&lt;/sub&gt; fragment (vasostatin-1, VS-1) compared to controls [median (25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-percentiles); total-CgA: 1.85 nM (1.01–4.28) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.75 nM (0.52–0.89), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004; VS-1: 2.76 nM (1.09–7.10) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.29 nM (0.26–0.32), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, respectively], but not of CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt; or CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-373&lt;/sub&gt; fragment. VS-1 positively correlated with total-CgA (r = 0.65, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The Receiver Operating Characteristic area under the curve was 0.9935 for VS-1 and 0.8824 for total-CgA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.067). Treatment of patients with somatostatin analogues decreased both total-CgA and VS-1. In contrast, administration of PPIs increased the plasma levels of total-CgA, but not of VS-1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that plasma VS-1 is a novel biomarker for ileal and pancreatic NENs.

Goat breeding has become an important sector in Eastern Europe, with Romania and Hungary being among the major producer countries. Given the limited number of research done up-to-date concerning genetic studies of indigenous goat breeds reared in Romania and Hungary, the current preliminary study aimed to analyze the variability of genes related to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism by using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP™). We studied 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonging to 19 genes in indigenous breeds from both countries, namely Banat’s White (n = 36), Carpatina (n = 35) from Romania and Hungarian Milking (n = 79) and identified 16 polymorphic SNPs among 10 genes (&lt;i&gt;PTX3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLEC4E&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNFSF13&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TLR3&lt;/i&gt;) in 150 animals. Furthermore, the diversity of the studied breeds was investigated. The PIC values ranged from 0.042 to 0.691. The mean values of observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.235 and 0.246 respectively. The highest observed heterozygosity was obtained for &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T in Banat’s White (0.464), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T in Carpatina (0.577) and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G in Hungarian Milking (0.588). Pairwise F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values between the Romanian breeds and Romanian and Hungarian breeds were small (0.009 and 0.015), indicating the close relationship among the studied goat populations. From all the polymorphic SNPs identified, the Hungarian Milking breed showed the highest proportion of polymorphisms (100%), whereas the Carpatina breed had the lowest percentage (87.5%). The highest value of MAF was obtained for &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G (0.46), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T (0.47), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10344025C&gt;T (0.45), and &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T (0.42).

Characterising the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogens &lt;i&gt;in natura&lt;/i&gt; is key to ensuring their efficient prevention and control. However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate dispersal parameters at scales that are relevant to real epidemics. Epidemiological surveys can provide informative data, but parameter estimation can be hampered when the timing of the epidemiological events is uncertain, and in the presence of interactions between disease spread, surveillance, and control. Further complications arise from imperfect detection of disease and from the huge number of data on individual hosts arising from landscape-level surveys. Here, we present a Bayesian framework that overcomes these barriers by integrating over associated uncertainties in a model explicitly combining the processes of disease dispersal, surveillance and control. Using a novel computationally efficient approach to account for patch geometry, we demonstrate that disease dispersal distances can be estimated accurately in a patchy (i.e. fragmented) landscape when disease control is ongoing. Applying this model to data for an aphid-borne virus (&lt;i&gt;Plum pox virus&lt;/i&gt;) surveyed for 15 years in 605 orchards, we obtain the first estimate of the distribution of flight distances of infectious aphids at the landscape scale. About 50% of aphid flights terminate beyond 90 m, which implies that most infectious aphids leaving a tree land outside the bounds of a 1-ha orchard. Moreover, long-distance flights are not rare–10% of flights exceed 1 km. By their impact on our quantitative understanding of winged aphid dispersal, these results can inform the design of management strategies for plant viruses, which are mainly aphid-borne.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6RNe0Vdqjuk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006085</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by David R.

Epidemiological surveys can provide informative data, but parameter estimation can be hampered when the timing of the epidemiological events is uncertain, and in the presence of interactions between disease spread, surveillance, and control. Further complications arise from imperfect detection of disease and from the huge number of data on individual hosts arising from landscape-level surveys. Here, we present a Bayesian framework that overcomes these barriers by integrating over associated uncertainties in a model explicitly combining the processes of disease dispersal, surveillance and control. Using a novel computationally efficient approach to account for patch geometry, we demonstrate that disease dispersal distances can be estimated accurately in a patchy (i.e. fragmented) landscape when disease control is ongoing. Applying this model to data for an aphid-borne virus (&lt;i&gt;Plum pox virus&lt;/i&gt;) surveyed for 15 years in 605 orchards, we obtain the first estimate of the distribution of flight distances of infectious aphids at the landscape scale. About 50% of aphid flights terminate beyond 90 m, which implies that most infectious aphids leaving a tree land outside the bounds of a 1-ha orchard. Moreover, long-distance flights are not rare–10% of flights exceed 1 km. By their impact on our quantitative understanding of winged aphid dispersal, these results can inform the design of management strategies for plant viruses, which are mainly aphid-borne.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6RNe0Vdqjuk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>David R.

Contemporary rodent models for bipolar disorders split the bipolar spectrum into complimentary behavioral endophenotypes representing mania and depression. Widely accepted mania models typically utilize single gene transgenics or pharmacological manipulations, but inbred rodent strains show great potential as mania models. Their acceptance is often limited by the lack of genotypic data needed to establish construct validity. In this study, we used a unique strategy to inexpensively explore and confirm population allele differences in naturally occurring candidate variants in a manic rodent strain, the Madison (MSN) mouse strain. Variants were identified using whole exome resequencing on a small population of animals. Interesting candidate variants were confirmed in a larger population with genotyping. We enriched these results with observations of locomotor behavior from a previous study. Resequencing identified 447 structural variants that are mostly fixed in the MSN strain relative to control strains. After filtering and annotation, we found 11 non-synonymous MSN variants that we believe alter protein function. The allele frequencies for 6 of these variants were consistent with explanatory variants for the Madison strain’s phenotype. The variants are in the &lt;i&gt;Npas2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cp&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Polr3c&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Smarca4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Slc5a7&lt;/i&gt; genes, and many of these genes’ products are in pathways implicated in human bipolar disorders. Variants in &lt;i&gt;Smarca4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Polr3c&lt;/i&gt; together explained over 40% of the variance in locomotor behavior in the Hsd:ICR founder strain. These results enhance the MSN strain’s construct validity and implicate altered nucleosome structure and transcriptional regulation as a chief molecular system underpinning behavior.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197624</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Genomic variants in an inbred mouse model predict mania-like behaviors</title><author><name>Michael C.

The establishment of agricultural matrices generally involves deforestation, which leads to fragmentation of the remaining forest. This fragmentation can affect forest dynamics both positively and negatively. Since most animal species are affected, certain groups can be used to measure the impact of such fragmentation. This study aimed to measure the impacts of agricultural crops (matrices) on ant communities of adjacent lower montane Atlantic rainforest fragments. We sampled nine forest fragments at locations surrounded by different agricultural matrices, namely: coffee (3 replicates); sugarcane (3); and pasture (3). At each site we installed pitfall traps along a 500 m transect from the interior of the matrix to the interior of the fragment (20 pitfall traps ~25 m apart). Each transect was partitioned into four categories: interior of the matrix; edge of the matrix; edge of the fragment; and interior of the fragment. For each sample site, we measured ant species richness and ant community composition within each transect category. Ant richness and composition differed between fragments and matrices. Each sample location had a specific composition of ants, probably because of the influence of the nature and management of the agricultural matrices. Species composition in the coffee matrix had the highest similarity to its corresponding fragment. The variability in species composition within forest fragments surrounded by pasture was greatest when compared with forest fragments surrounded by sugarcane or, to a lesser extent, coffee. Functional guild composition differed between locations, but the most representative guild was ‘generalist’ both in the agricultural matrices and forest fragments. Our results are important for understanding how agricultural matrices act on ant communities, and also, how these isolated forest fragments could act as an island of biodiversity in an ‘ocean of crops’.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197697</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Agricultural matrices affect ground ant assemblage composition inside forest fragments</title><author><name>Diego Santana Assis</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197697</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Santana Assis, Iracenir Andrade Dos Santos, Flavio Nunes Ramos, Katty Elena Barrios-Rojas, Jonathan David Majer, Evaldo Ferreira Vilela&lt;/p&gt;

Our results are important for understanding how agricultural matrices act on ant communities, and also, how these isolated forest fragments could act as an island of biodiversity in an ‘ocean of crops’.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1527109200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197697</link><fingerprint>718c265b</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2333:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197697</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-a?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.1.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7e2:93d646dc</id><author><name>Smith, H.

Retention in care remains an important issue for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs according to WHO guidelines, formerly called the “Option B+” approach. The objective of this study was to examine how poverty, gender, and health system factors interact to influence women’s participation in PMTCT services. We used qualitative research, literature, and hypothesized variable connections to diagram causes and effects in causal loop models. We found that many factors, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, service design and quality, stigma, disclosure, spouse/partner influence, decision-making autonomy, and knowledge about PMTCT, influence psychosocial health, which in turn affects women’s participation in PMTCT services. Thus, interventions to improve psychosocial health need to address many factors to be successful. We also found that the design of PMTCT services, a modifiable factor, is important because it affects several other factors. We identified 66 feedback loops that may contribute to policy resistance—that is, a policy’s failure to have its intended effect. Our findings point to the need for a multipronged intervention to encourage women’s continued participation in PMTCT services and for longitudinal research to quantify and test our causal loop model.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197239</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Interactions among poverty, gender, and health systems affect women’s participation in services to prevent HIV transmission from mother to child: A causal loop analysis</title><author><name>Jennifer Yourkavitch</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197239</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Yourkavitch, Kristen Hassmiller Lich, Valerie L.

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major mediator of peritoneal fibrosis and reportedly affects expression of the H3K4 methyltransferase, SET7/9. SET7/9-induced H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) critically activates transcription of fibrosis-related genes. In this study, we examined the effect of SET7/9 inhibition on peritoneal fibrosis in mice and in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). We also examined SET7/9 expression in nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Murine peritoneal fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of methylglyoxal (MGO) into male C57/BL6 mice over 21 days. Sinefungin, a SET7/9 inhibitor, was administered subcutaneously just before MGO injection (10 mg/kg). SET7/9 expression was elevated in both MGO-injected mice and nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of PD patients. SET7/9 expression was positively correlated with dialysate/plasma ratio of creatinine in PD patients. Sinefungin was shown immunohistochemically to suppress expression of mesenchymal cells and collagen deposition, accompanied by decreased H3K4me1 levels. Peritoneal equilibration tests showed that sinefungin attenuated the urea nitrogen transport rate from plasma and the glucose absorption rate from the dialysate. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, sinefungin suppressed TGF-β1-induced expression of fibrotic markers and inhibited H3K4me1. These findings suggest that inhibiting the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196844</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Inhibition of the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis</title><author><name>Ryo Tamura</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196844</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Tamura, Shigehiro Doi, Ayumu Nakashima, Kensuke Sasaki, Kazuya Maeda, Toshinori Ueno, Takao Masaki&lt;/p&gt;

Histocompatibility labs must convert molecular HLA typings to antigen equivalencies for entry into the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) UNet system. While an Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) policy document provides general guidelines for conversion, the process is complex because no antigen mapping table is available. We present a UNOS antigen equivalency table for all IMGT/HLA alleles at the A, B, C, DRB1, DRB3/4/5, DQA1, and DQB1 loci. Methods: An automated script was developed to generate a UNOS antigen equivalency table. Data sources used in the conversion algorithm included the World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA) antigen table, the HLA Dictionary, and UNOS-provided tables. To validate antigen mappings, we converted National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) high resolution allele frequencies to antigen equivalents and compared with the UNOS Calculated Panel Reactive Antibodies (CPRA) reference panel. Results: Normalized frequency similarity scores between independent NMDP and UNOS panels for 4 US population categories (Caucasian, Hispanic, African American and Asian/Pacific Islander) ranged from 0.85 to 0.97, indicating correct antigen mapping. An open source web application (ALLele to ANtigen (ALLAN)) and web services were also developed to map unambiguous and ambiguous HLA typing data to UNOS antigen equivalents based on NMDP population-specific allele frequencies (http://www.transplanttoolbox.org). Conclusions: This tool sets a foundation for using molecular HLA typing to compute the virtual crossmatch and may aid in reducing typing discrepancies in UNet.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328914v1?rss=1</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>Mapping molecular HLA typing data to UNOS antigen equivalents for improved virtual crossmatch [NEW RESULTS]</title><author><name>Kaur, N.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328914v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Virtual crossmatch utilizes HLA typing and antibody screen assay data as a part of organ offers in deceased donor allocation systems.

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm). In addition, a moderate nitrogen rate (240 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) could increase root growth, especially in the shallow soil layers. The differences observed with the minirhizotron method were clearer than those observed with the soil coring method.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197284</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Determining the effects of nitrogen rate on cotton root growth and distribution with soil cores and minirhizotrons</title><author><name>Jing Chen</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197284</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Chen, Liantao Liu, Zhanbiao Wang, Hongchun Sun, Yongjiang Zhang, Zhanyuan Lu, Cundong Li&lt;/p&gt;

The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002912</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Ménard, Clélia Costechareyre, Gabriel Ichim, Jonathan Blachier, David Neves, Loraine Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Reinhard Depping, Jan Koster, Pierre Saintigny, Patrick Mehlen, Servane Tauszig-Delamasure&lt;/p&gt;

DeepPVP is freely available at https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/phenomenet-vp Conclusions: DeepPVP further improves on existing variant prioritization methods both in terms of speed as well as accuracy.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525244400000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/311621v1?rss=1</link><fingerprint>369d2584</fingerprint><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1632228c7a1:69bc38:93d646dc</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><updated>1525381200000</updated><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongyi Zhou, Mu Gao, Jeffrey Skolnick&lt;/p&gt;
To exploit the plethora of information provided by Next Generation Sequencing, the identification of the genetic mutations responsible for disease in general or cancer in particular, among the thousands of neutral germline or somatic variations is a crucial task. Genome-wide association studies for the detection of disease-associated genes or cancer drivers can only identify common variations or driver genes in a cohort of patients. Thus, they cannot discover unique disease-associated mutations or cancer driver genes on a personal basis. Moreover, even when there are such common variations, their significance is unknown. Here, we extend the machine learning based approach ENTPRISE developed for predicting the disease association of missense mutations to frameshift and nonsense mutations. The new approach, ENTPRISE-X, is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods VEST-indel and DDIG-in for predicting the disease association of germline frameshift mutations in terms of balanced measure Matthew’s correlation coefficient, MCC, with a MCC of 0.586 for ENTPRISE-X, versus 0.412 by VEST-indel and 0.321 by DDIG-in, respectively. Large scale testing on the ExAC dataset shows ENTPRISE-X has a much lower fraction of 16% of variations classified as disease causing, as compared to VEST-indel’s 26% and DDIG-in’s 65% of predictions as being disease-associated.

Success rates for catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation patients are currently low; however, there is a subset of patients for whom electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins alone is a successful treatment strategy. It is difficult to identify these patients because there are a multitude of factors affecting arrhythmia susceptibility and maintenance, and the individual contributions of these factors are difficult to determine clinically. We hypothesised that the combination of pulmonary vein (PV) electrophysiology and atrial body fibrosis determine driver location and effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We used bilayer biatrial computer models based on patient geometries to investigate the effects of PV properties and atrial fibrosis on arrhythmia inducibility, maintenance mechanisms, and the outcome of PVI. Short PV action potential duration (APD) increased arrhythmia susceptibility, while longer PV APD was found to be protective. Arrhythmia inducibility increased with slower conduction velocity (CV) at the LA/PV junction, but not for cases with homogeneous CV changes or slower CV at the distal PV. Phase singularity (PS) density in the PV region for cases with PV fibrosis was increased. Arrhythmia dynamics depend on both PV properties and fibrosis distribution, varying from meandering rotors to PV reentry (in cases with baseline or long APD), to stable rotors at regions of high fibrosis density. Measurement of fibrosis and PV properties may indicate patient specific susceptibility to AF initiation and maintenance. PV PS density before PVI was higher for cases in which AF terminated or converted to a macroreentry; thus, high PV PS density may indicate likelihood of PVI success.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rn0Tfj7bu6A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006166</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Caroline H.

Around 70% of circulating alpha-2-antiplasmin (α2AP), the main natural plasmin inhibitor, is N-terminally cleaved between residues Pro12 and Asn13 by antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme. This converts native Met-α2AP into the more potent fibrinolysis inhibitor Asn-α2AP. The Arg6Trp (R6W) polymorphism affects the N-terminal cleavage rate of Met-α2AP in a purified system, with ~8-fold faster conversion of Met(R6)-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP. To date, assays to determine N-terminally intact Met-α2AP in plasma have been limited to an ELISA that only measures Met(R6)-α2AP. The aim of this study was to generate and characterize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and all α2AP forms (total-α2AP) in order to develop specific Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP ELISAs. Recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and Asn-α2AP were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. Using hybridoma technology, a panel of 25 mAbs was generated against a mixture of recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP. All mAbs were evaluated for their specific reactivity using the three recombinant α2APs in one-site non-competitive ELISAs. Three mAbs were selected to develop sandwich-type ELISAs. MA-AP37E2 and MA-AP34C4 were selected for their specific reactivity against Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, and used for coating. MA-AP15D7 was selected for its reactivity against total-α2AP and used for detection. With the novel ELISAs we determined Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP levels in plasma samples and we showed that Met(R6)-α2AP was converted faster into Asn-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP in a plasma milieu. In conclusion, we developed two specific ELISAs for Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, in plasma. This will enable us to determine N-terminal heterogeneity of α2AP in plasma samples.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196911</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Generation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminus of alpha-2-antiplasmin</title><author><name>Shiraazkhan Abdul</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196911</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shiraazkhan Abdul, Miet Peeters, Els Brouwers, Joyce J.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Active recovery is often used by athletes after strenuous exercise or competition but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We observed a time × group interaction effect for VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; (p = 0.013). Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026).

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Active recovery is often used by athletes after strenuous exercise or competition but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We observed a time × group interaction effect for VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; (p = 0.013). Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026). No significant effects were observed for all other variables.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Active recovery increased aspects of central, rather than muscle recovery. However, no effect on MVC was seen, implying that even if active recovery speeds up CNS recovery, without affecting the recovery of muscle contractile properties, this doesn´t translate into increases in overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526331600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197339</link><fingerprint>65dc3326</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219f:93d646dc</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197339</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><updated>1526590800000</updated><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Jamei, Aleksandr Nisnevich, Everett Wetchler, Sylvia Sudat, Eric Liu, Kirtan Upadhyaya&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197793</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Correction: Predicting all-cause risk of 30-day hospital readmission using artificial neural networks</title><author><name>Mehdi Jamei</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197793</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Jamei, Aleksandr Nisnevich, Everett Wetchler, Sylvia Sudat, Eric Liu, Kirtan Upadhyaya&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526590800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197793</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>e0eaca59</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85445:93d646dc</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197793</canonicalUrl></item><item><updated>1526418000000</updated><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo-jian Chen, Kai Liu, Lin-jun Zhou, Guilherme Gomes-Silva, Carolin Sommer-Trembo, Martin Plath&lt;/p&gt;
Consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) can affect individual mate choice decisions. We asked whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent across different mate choice situations. Using western mosquitofish (&lt;i&gt;Gambusia affinis&lt;/i&gt;) as our study organism, we characterized focal individuals (males and females) twice for boldness, activity, and sociability/shoaling and found high and significant behavioral repeatability. Additionally, each focal individual was tested in two different dichotomous mate choice tests in which it could choose between computer-animated stimulus fish of the opposite sex that differed in body size and activity levels, respectively. Personality had different effects on female and male mate choice: females that were larger than average showed stronger preferences for large-bodied males with increasing levels of boldness/activity (i.e., towards more proactive personality types). Males that were larger than average and had higher shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social dominance (especially in males). Previous studies found evidence for assortative mate choice based on personality types or hypothesized the existence of behavioral syndromes of individuals’ choosiness across mate choice criteria, possibly including other personality traits. Our present study exemplifies that far more complex patterns of personality-dependent mate choice can emerge in natural systems.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197197</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Personality differentially affects individual mate choice decisions in female and male Western mosquitofish (&amp;lt;i&gt;Gambusia affinis&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><author><name>Bo-jian Chen</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197197</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bo-jian Chen, Kai Liu, Lin-jun Zhou, Guilherme Gomes-Silva, Carolin Sommer-Trembo, Martin Plath&lt;/p&gt;

Modularity is a widespread property in biological systems. It implies that interactions occur mainly within groups of system elements. A modular arrangement facilitates adjustment of one module without perturbing the rest of the system. Therefore, modularity of developmental mechanisms is a major factor for evolvability, the potential to produce beneficial variation from random genetic change. Understanding how modularity evolves in gene regulatory networks, that create the distinct gene activity patterns that characterize different parts of an organism, is key to developmental and evolutionary biology. One hypothesis for the evolution of modules suggests that interactions between some sets of genes become maladaptive when selection favours additional gene activity patterns. The removal of such interactions by selection would result in the formation of modules. A second hypothesis suggests that modularity evolves in response to sparseness, the scarcity of interactions within a system. Here I simulate the evolution of gene regulatory networks and analyse diverse experimentally sustained networks to study the relationship between sparseness and modularity. My results suggest that sparseness alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain modularity in gene regulatory networks. However, sparseness amplifies the effects of forms of selection that, like selection for additional gene activity patterns, already produce an increase in modularity. That evolution of new gene activity patterns is frequent across evolution also supports that it is a major factor in the evolution of modularity. That sparseness is widespread across gene regulatory networks indicates that it may have facilitated the evolution of modules in a wide variety of cases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eh0FCzbR2R4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006172</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Espinosa-Soto&lt;/p&gt;

Unpasteurized dairy products are known to occasionally harbor &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and have been implicated in recent listeriosis outbreaks and numerous sporadic cases of listeriosis. However, the diversity and virulence profiles of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from these products have not been fully described. Here we report a genomic analysis of 121 &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from milk, milk filters, and milking equipment collected from bovine dairy farms in 19 states over a 12-year period. In a multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) analysis, 59 Virulence Types (VT) were identified, of which 25% were Epidemic Clones I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, or X, and 31 were novel VT. In a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis, 60 Sequence Types (ST) of 56 Clonal Complexes (CC) were identified. Within lineage I, CC5 and CC1 were among the most abundant, and within lineage II, CC7 and CC37 were the most abundant. Multiple CCs previously associated with central nervous system and maternal-neonatal infections were identified. A genomic analysis identified variable distribution of virulence markers, &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; pathogenicity islands (LIPI) -1, -3, and -4, and stress survival island-1 (SSI-1). Of these, 14 virulence markers, including LIPI-3 and -4 were more frequently detected in one lineage (I or II) than the other. LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks. Results of this study also demonstrate significant number of strains isolated from dairy farms encode virulence markers associated with severe human disease.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197053</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Genetic diversity and virulence profiles of &amp;lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&amp;lt;/i&gt; recovered from bulk tank milk, milk filters, and milking equipment from dairies in the United States (2002 to 2014)</title><author><name>Seon Woo Kim</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197053</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seon Woo Kim, Julie Haendiges, Eric N.

Adult stem cells are considered multipotent, restricted to differentiate into a few tissue-specific cell types. With the advent of technologies which can dedifferentiate and transdifferentiate cell types, assumptions about the process of cell fate determination must be reconsidered, including the role of extrinsic versus intrinsic factors. To determine the plasticity of adult neural progenitors, rat hippocampal progenitor cells were xenotransplanted into embryonic zebrafish. These animals allow for easy detection of transplanted cells due to their external development and transparency at early stages. Adult neural progenitors were observed throughout the zebrafish for the duration of the experiment (at least five days post-transplantation). While the majority of transplanted cells were observed in the central nervous system, a large percentage of cells were located in superficial tissues. However, approximately one-third of these cells retained neural morphology and expression of the neuronal marker, Class III β-tubulin, indicating that the transplanted adult neural progenitors did not adapt alternate fates. A very small subset of cells demonstrated unique, non-neural flattened morphology, suggesting that adult neural progenitors may exhibit plasticity in this model, though at a very low rate. These findings demonstrate that the developing zebrafish may be an efficient model to explore plasticity of a variety of adult stem cell types and the role of external factors on cell fate.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198025</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Xenotransplantation of adult hippocampal neural progenitors into the developing zebrafish for assessment of stem cell plasticity</title><author><name>Elizabeth J.

Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissue-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner MNs. Here, we show that constitutive &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets, including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue (CT) as a cell type in which &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; activity is required for the non–cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jN05gwz7zUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004734</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Françoise Helmbacher&lt;/p&gt;

Team SA involves a common perspective between two or more individuals regarding current environmental events, their meaning, and projected future status. Team SA has been theorized to be important for resuscitation team effectiveness. Accordingly, multidimensional frameworks of observable behaviors relevant to resuscitation teams are needed to understand more deeply the nature of team SA, its implications for team effectiveness, and whether it can be trained. A seven-dimension team resuscitation SA framework was developed following a literature review and consensus process using a modified Delphi approach with a group of content experts. We applied a pre-post design within a day-long team training program involving four video-recorded simulated resuscitation events and 42 teams across Canada. The first and fourth events represented “pre” and “post” training events, respectively. Teams were scored on SA five times within each 15-minute event. Distractions were introduced to investigate whether SA scores would be affected. The current study provides initial construct validity evidence for a new measure of SA and explicates SA&apos;s role in resuscitation teams.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196825</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>A taxonomy and rating system to measure situation awareness in resuscitation teams</title><author><name>Thomas A.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between experiences of being bullied at school and psychological distress/work engagement, with six steps.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis was conducted for 3,111 workers. The number of respondents who reported being bullied in elementary or junior high school was 1,318 (42%). We found that the experience of being bullied at school was significantly associated with high psychological distress in adulthood (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .079, p = &amp;lt; .0001); however, the work engagement scores of respondents who were bullied were significantly higher than for people who were not bullied at school (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .068, p = &amp;lt; .0001), after adjusting all covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Being bullied at school was positively associated with both psychological distress and work engagement in a sample of workers. Being bullied at school may be a predisposing factor for psychological distress, as previously reported. The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525986000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197168</link><fingerprint>48429c9d</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559154:93d646dc</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197168</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525473014800</crawled><description>Motivation: Gene lists are routinely produced from various genome-wide studies.

The stress-induced mutagenesis hypothesis postulates that in response to stress, bacteria increase their genome-wide mutation rate, in turn increasing the chances that a descendant is able to better withstand the stress. This has implications for antibiotic treatment: exposure to subinhibitory doses of antibiotics has been reported to increase bacterial mutation rates and thus probably the rate at which resistance mutations appear and lead to treatment failure. More generally, the hypothesis posits that stress increases evolvability (the ability of a population to generate adaptive genetic diversity) and thus accelerates evolution. Measuring mutation rates under stress, however, is problematic, because existing methods assume there is no death. Yet subinhibitory stress levels may induce a substantial death rate. Death events need to be compensated by extra replication to reach a given population size, thus providing more opportunities to acquire mutations. We show that ignoring death leads to a systematic overestimation of mutation rates under stress. We developed a system based on plasmid segregation that allows us to measure death and division rates simultaneously in bacterial populations. Using this system, we found that a substantial death rate occurs at the tested subinhibitory concentrations previously reported to increase mutation rate. Taking this death rate into account lowers and sometimes removes the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, even when antibiotics increase mutation rate, we show that subinhibitory treatments do not increase genetic diversity and evolvability, again because of effects of the antibiotics on population dynamics. We conclude that antibiotic-induced mutagenesis is overestimated because of death and that understanding evolvability under stress requires accounting for the effects of stress on population dynamics as much as on mutation rate. Our goal here is dual: we show that population dynamics and, in particular, the numbers of cell divisions are crucial but neglected parameters in the evolvability of a population, and we provide experimental and computational tools and methods to study evolvability under stress, leading to a reassessment of the magnitude and significance of the stress-induced mutagenesis paradigm.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YW43eur48VA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005056</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Frenoy, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;

This study demonstrates that the EE‐GMFCC method is capable of providing reliable prediction of relative binding affinities for protein–protein complexes. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><crawled>1527585277365</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Depression: the radical theory linking it to inflammation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression: the radical theory linking it to inflammation, Published online: 29 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05261-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05261-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Alison Abbott considers a persuasive case for the link between body and mind.</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05261-3</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Depression: the radical theory linking it to inflammation</title><engagementRate>2.57</engagementRate><author><name>Alison Abbott</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05261-3</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Depression: the radical theory linking it to inflammation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression: the radical theory linking it to inflammation, Published online: 29 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05261-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05261-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Alison Abbott considers a persuasive case for the link between body and mind.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1527577200000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05261-3</link><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05261-3/d41586-018-05261-3_15785088.jpg</url><height>576</height><width>1024</width></visual><fingerprint>25a6493c</fingerprint><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163ab2d85b5:1d80784:7cfe07d6</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>54</engagement></item><item><updated>1526677200000</updated><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bedilu Alamirie Ejigu, Eshetu Wencheko, Kiros Berhane&lt;/p&gt;
Anaemia is a condition in which the haemoglobin concentration falls below an established cut-off value due to a decrease in the number and size of red blood cells. The current study aimed (i) to assess the spatial pattern and (ii) to identify determinants related to anaemia using the third Ethiopian demographic health survey. To achieve these objectives, this study took into account the sampling weight and the clustered nature of the data. As a result, multilevel modeling has been used in the statistical analysis. The analysis included complete cases from 15,909 females, and 13,903 males. Among all subjects who agreed for hemeoglobin test, 5.22% males, and 16.60% females were anemic. In both binary and ordinal outcome modeling approaches, educational level, age, wealth index, BMI and HIV status were found to be significant predictors of anaemia prevalence. Furthermore, this study applied spatial methods to generate maps at regional level which could be useful for policy makers where great efforts should be concentrated to reduce the prevalence of anaemia. As revealed by Moran’s &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; test, significant spatial autocorrelation were noted across clusters. The risk of anaemia was found to vary across different regions, and higher prevalences were observed in Somali and Affar regions.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197171</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Spatial pattern and determinants of anaemia in Ethiopia</title><author><name>Bedilu Alamirie Ejigu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197171</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bedilu Alamirie Ejigu, Eshetu Wencheko, Kiros Berhane&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; is a cell-cycle regulator. &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; has been identified in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, but few researchers have studied &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; in shrimps. We cloned &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; from the black tiger shrimp (&lt;i&gt;Penaeus monodon&lt;/i&gt;). The full-length cDNA sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; had 3,334 base pairs (bp), with an open reading frame of 1,455 bp. The complete genomic sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; (11,081 bp) contained 10 exons separated by nine introns. qRT-PCR showed that &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in the ovaries and gills of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;.

Accordingly there are many diseases that result directly from either lack or excess of iron. Iron has also been associated with a wide range of other diseases and may have an important role in aging. Yet many molecular and physiological aspects of iron regulation have only been discovered recently and others are still awaiting elucidation. In the last 18 years, after the discovery of the hormone hepcidin, many details of iron regulation have become better understood and a clearer picture is starting to emerge, at least in qualitative terms. However there is still no good quantitative and dynamic description of iron absorption, distribution, storage and mobilization that agrees with the wide array of phenotypes presented in several iron-related diseases. The present work addresses this issue by developing a mathematical model of iron distribution in mice that was calibrated with existing ferrokinetic data and subsequently validated against data from a series of iron disorders, such as hemochromatosis, {beta}-thalassemia, atransferrinemia and anemia of inflammation. To adequately fit the ferrokinetic data required including the following mechanisms: a) the role of transferrin in deliving iron to tissues, b) the induction of hepcidin by high levels of transferrin-bound iron, c) the ferroportin-dependent hepcidin-regulated iron export from tissues, d) the erythropoietin regulation of erythropoiesis, and e) direct NTBI uptake by the liver. The utility of such a model to simulate disease interventions was demonstrated by using it to investigate the outcome of different schedules of transferrin treatment in {beta}-thalassemia. The present model is a successful step towards a comprehensive mathematical model of iron physiology incorporating cellular and organ level details.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323899v1?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/16/323899</canonicalUrl><title>A computational model to understand mouse iron physiology and diseases [NEW RESULTS]</title><author><name>Parmar, J.

Accordingly there are many diseases that result directly from either lack or excess of iron. Iron has also been associated with a wide range of other diseases and may have an important role in aging. Yet many molecular and physiological aspects of iron regulation have only been discovered recently and others are still awaiting elucidation. In the last 18 years, after the discovery of the hormone hepcidin, many details of iron regulation have become better understood and a clearer picture is starting to emerge, at least in qualitative terms. However there is still no good quantitative and dynamic description of iron absorption, distribution, storage and mobilization that agrees with the wide array of phenotypes presented in several iron-related diseases. The present work addresses this issue by developing a mathematical model of iron distribution in mice that was calibrated with existing ferrokinetic data and subsequently validated against data from a series of iron disorders, such as hemochromatosis, {beta}-thalassemia, atransferrinemia and anemia of inflammation. To adequately fit the ferrokinetic data required including the following mechanisms: a) the role of transferrin in deliving iron to tissues, b) the induction of hepcidin by high levels of transferrin-bound iron, c) the ferroportin-dependent hepcidin-regulated iron export from tissues, d) the erythropoietin regulation of erythropoiesis, and e) direct NTBI uptake by the liver.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a cornerstone in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies such as multiple myeloma (MM) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Yet, prolonged GC use is hampered by deleterious GC-related side effects and the emergence of GC resistance. To tackle and overcome these GC-related problems, the applicability of selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and modulators was studied, in search of fewer side-effects and at least equal therapeutic efficacy as classic GCs. Compound A (CpdA) is a prototypical example of such a selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator and does not support GR-mediated transactivation. Here, we examined whether the combination of CpdA with the classic GC dexamethasone (Dex) may improve GC responsiveness of MM and ALL cell lines. We find that the combination of Dex and CpdA does not substantially enhance GC-mediated cell killing. In line, several apoptosis hallmarks, such as caspase 3/7 activity, PARP cleavage and the levels of cleaved-caspase 3 remain unchanged upon combining Dex with CpdA. Moreover, we monitor no additional inhibition of cell proliferation and the homologous downregulation of GR is not counteracted by the combination of Dex and CpdA. In addition, CpdA is unable to modulate Dex-liganded GR transactivation and transrepression, yet, Dex-mediated transrepression is also aberrant in these lymphoid cell lines. Together, transrepression-favoring compounds, alone or combined with GCs, do not seem a valid strategy in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197000</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Effect of combining glucocorticoids with Compound A on glucocorticoid receptor responsiveness in lymphoid malignancies</title><author><name>Dorien Clarisse</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197000</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dorien Clarisse, Karlien Van Wesemael, Jan Tavernier, Fritz Offner, Ilse M.

Together, transrepression-favoring compounds, alone or combined with GCs, do not seem a valid strategy in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525813200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197000</link><fingerprint>5db29854</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475062:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197000</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525177501573</crawled><description>The hepatitis B virus capsid represents a promising therapeutic target.

Hypoxia-mediated pancreatic beta cell death is one of the main causes of pancreatic beta celldeath, which leads to the loss of functional pancreatic beta cell mass and type 1 diabetes andtype 2 diabetes.However, the molecular mechanisms that control life and death of pancreatic beta cells remain poorly understood. Here we showed that mitochondrial fission was strongly induced in pancreatic beta cellsmainly due to an elevation of DRP1&lt;sup&gt;S616&lt;/sup&gt; phosphorylation through HIF-1αactivation and subsequent DRP1 mitochondrial translocation. Hypoxia-induced pancreatic beta cell death can be reversed by the inhibition of mitochondrial fission viaDRP1 knockdown. We further demonstrated that hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission untightened the cristae formation, which subsequently triggers mitochondrial cytochrome c release and consequent caspase activation. Moreover, treatment with mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1), a specific inhibitor of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission, significantly suppressedbeta cell death in vitro, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of diabetes.Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for the DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission in hypoxia-induced beta cell death, which provides a strong evidence for thisprocess as drug target indiabetestreatment.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197266</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Increased mitochondrial fission is critical for hypoxia-induced pancreatic beta cell death</title><author><name>Da Zhang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197266</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Da Zhang, Yanfang Liu, Yao Tang, Xiaofeng Wang, Zhichao Li, Rui Li, Zhenyu Ti, Weidong Gao, Jigang Bai, Yi Lv&lt;/p&gt;

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is usually a reliable technique to find the binding sites of a transcription factor. In the current study, we developed a suitable ChIP method using developing castor bean seeds. A castor bean seed with large and persistent endosperm contains high amounts of storage lipids (ca. 50–60%) and is often considered as a model material to studying seed biology. In oleaginous seeds, due to the rich oils which could seriously affect immunoprecipitation and DNA isolation, it is often difficult to carry out a successful ChIP experiment. Thus, the development of an efficient ChIP method for oleaginous seeds is required. In this study, we modified different steps, including tissue preparation for cross-linking, chromatin washing, sonication and immunoprecipitation of other existing methods. As exemplified by the targeted gene identification of a master regulator WRI1, which regulates fatty acid biosynthesis, we found that the improved ChIP method worked well. We analyzed percentage input and fold changes of the ChIPed DNA. We also made successful ChIP-seq libraries using this method. This method provides a technical support not only for use on castor bean seeds; it might be used equally to analyze protein-DNA interaction &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in other oleaginous seeds.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197126</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Development of an efficient chromatin immunoprecipitation method to investigate protein-DNA interaction in oleaginous castor bean seeds</title><author><name>Mohammad Enamul Haque</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197126</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammad Enamul Haque, Bing Han, Bin Wang, Yue Wang, Aizhong Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess whether embryonic DNA isolated from blastocyst culture conditioned medium (BCCM) combined with blastocoel fluid (BF) could be used for blastocyst stage non-invasive preimplantation genetic testing for chromosomal aneuploidy (non-invasive preimplantation genetic screening, NIPGS).&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;47 embryos from 35 patients undergoing IVF.&lt;/p&gt; Interventions &lt;p&gt;DNA analysis of combined BCCM plus BF in comparison with trophectoderm (TE) biopsy and/or whole blastocyst (WB)using next generation sequencing (NGS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Embryonic DNA was successfully amplified in 47/47 NIPGS samples (28 frozen-thawed and 19 fresh culture samples) ranging from 6.3 to 44.0 ng/μl. For frozen-thawed embryos, the concordance rate for whole chromosome copy number per sample was equivalent between NIPGS vs. TE biopsy, NIPGS vs. WB and TE vs. WB samples taken from the same embryo was 87.5%; 96.4% and 91.7% respectively (P&gt;0.05), and the rate of concordance per single chromosome was 99.3%, 99.7% and 99.7%, respectively (P&gt;0.05). In fresh cases (Day 4 to Day 5/6 culture), the concordance rate for whole chromosome copy number per sample between NIPGS vs. TE samples taken from the same embryo was 100%, and the rate of concordance per single chromosome was 98.2% (P&gt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A combination of BCCM and BF contains sufficient embryonic DNA for whole genome amplification and accurate aneuploidy screening.

Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt;, currently affecting more than 200 million people. Among the various species of this parasite that infect humans, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; is the most common. Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study, we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this, we investigated systemic acute toxicity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice. Treated mice showed no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or histological parameters compared to non-treated animals. Epiisopilosine showed potential as a schistosomicidal drug: it did not cause acute toxicity and it displayed an acceptable safety profile in the animal model.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196667</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Epiisopilosine alkaloid has activity against &amp;lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&amp;lt;/i&gt; in mice without acute toxicity</title><author><name>Maria A.

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006057</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vicente Botella-Soler, Stéphane Deny, Georg Martius, Olivier Marre, Gašper Tkačik&lt;/p&gt;

We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Vicente Botella-Soler</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0tROk9h9FSA/article</href></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><published>1525986000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006057</link><fingerprint>34d1490d</fingerprint><title>Nonlinear decoding of a complex movie from the mammalian retina</title><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1634b3364f4:491e38:abeb7260</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>68</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525205300057</crawled><description>Neuroimaging evidence supports a role of the default mode network (DMN) in spontaneous thought and goal-driven internally oriented processes, such as recalling an autobiographical event, and has demonstrated its deactivation during focused, externally oriented attention.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the accuracy and optimal cut-off point of self-diagnosis and clinical symptoms of seasonal influenza compared with rapid influenza diagnostic tests as the reference standard, we conducted a cross sectional observational study at a rural clinic in Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data during three influenza seasons (December 2013 to April 2016) were retrospectively collected from the medical records and pre-examination sheets of 111 patients aged &gt;11 years (mean age 48.1 years, men 53.2%) who were suspected of influenza infection and underwent rapid influenza diagnostic testing. Patients’ characteristics (age, sex, and past medical history of influenza infection), clinical signs (axillary temperature, pulse rate, cough, joint and muscle pain, and history of fever [acute or sudden, gradual, and absence of fever]), duration from the onset of symptoms, severity of feeling sick compared with a common cold (severe, similar, and mild), self-reported likelihood of influenza (%), and results of rapid influenza diagnostic tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At the optimal cut-off point (30%) for estimation of self-diagnosis of seasonal influenza, the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.00) and negative likelihood ratio (LR–) was 0.57 (0.35 to 0.93). At a 10% cut-off point, LR–was 0.33 (0.12 to 0.96). At an 80% cut-off point, LR+ was 2.75 (0.75 to 10.07). As for clinical signs, the combination of acute or sudden onset fever and cough had LR+ of 3.27 (1.68 to 6.35). Absence of cough showed LR–of 0.15 (0.04 to 0.61).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Self-diagnosis of influenza using the optimal cut-off point (30%) was not found useful for ruling in or ruling out an influenza diagnosis.

The anti-inflammatory properties of sand fly saliva favor the establishment of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania infantum&lt;/i&gt; infection. In contrast, an antibody response against &lt;i&gt;Lutzomyia longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; saliva is often associated with a protective cell-mediated response against canine visceral leishmaniasis. Genetic studies may demonstrate to what extent the ability to secrete anti-saliva antibodies depends on genetic or environmental factors. However, the genetic basis of canine antibody response against sand fly saliva has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with the anti-&lt;i&gt;Lu&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; salivary IgG response in 189 dogs resident in endemic areas in order to provide information for prophylactic strategies. Dogs were classified into five groups based on serological and parasitological diagnosis and clinical evaluation. Anti-salivary gland homogenate (SGH) IgG levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and genotyped using a SNP chip with 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.

The anti-inflammatory properties of sand fly saliva favor the establishment of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania infantum&lt;/i&gt; infection. In contrast, an antibody response against &lt;i&gt;Lutzomyia longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; saliva is often associated with a protective cell-mediated response against canine visceral leishmaniasis. Genetic studies may demonstrate to what extent the ability to secrete anti-saliva antibodies depends on genetic or environmental factors. However, the genetic basis of canine antibody response against sand fly saliva has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with the anti-&lt;i&gt;Lu&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; salivary IgG response in 189 dogs resident in endemic areas in order to provide information for prophylactic strategies.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH. Consistently funded interventions included testing, partner services and linkage to care and interventions for men who have sex with men (MSM).

Research and development increasingly apply participatory approaches that involve both stakeholders and scientists. This article presents an evaluation of German and Tanzanian researchers’ perceptions during their activities as part of a large interdisciplinary research project in Tanzania. The project focused on prioritizing and implementing food-securing upgrading strategies across the components of rural food value chains. The participants involved during the course of the project were asked to provide feedback on 10 different research steps and to evaluate eight core features related to the functioning and potential shortcomings of the project. The study discriminated among evaluation differences linked to culture, gender, and institutional status. Perceptions differed between Tanzanian and German participants depending on the type and complexity of the participatory research steps undertaken and the intensity of stakeholder participation. There were differences in perception linked to gender and hierarchical status; however, those differences were not as concise and significant as those linked to nationality. These findings indicate that participatory action research of this nature requires more targeted strategies and planning tailored to the type of activity. Such planning would result in more efficient and satisfactory communication, close collaboration, and mutual feedback to avoid conflicts and other problems. We further conclude that it would be advisable to carefully incorporate training on these aspects into future project designs.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196790</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Cultural background, gender, and institutional status have an effect on the evaluation of multi-disciplinary participatory action research</title><author><name>Frieder Graef</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196790</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Frieder Graef, Stefan Sieber&lt;/p&gt;

The polymorphisms at the α-chain of the IL-7 receptor (&lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt;) have been related to T-cell homeostasis and development and may contribute to immune system deregulation. In the present study, we analyzed the association between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms and the progression of liver fibrosis in patients infected with HCV. We carried out a retrospective study with a design consisting of repeated measurements in 187 HCV-infected patients, to study the risk prediction of liver fibrosis progression using genetic factors. We genotyped the rs6897932, rs987106 and rs3194051 &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms using the Agena Bioscience’s MassARRAY. Transient elastography was used to measure liver stiffness. The used cut-offs were: &amp;lt;7.1 kPa (F0-F1), 7.1–9.4 kPa (F2; significant fibrosis), 9.5-12.4 kPa (F3; advanced fibrosis), and ≥12.5 kPa (F4; cirrhosis). All HCV genotypes were analyzed. The median of follow-up time was 47.9 months. Baseline liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values did not show significant statistical differences for &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes (p&gt;0.05). In univariate analysis, the rs6897932 T allele had a positive relationship with an increase in LSM (arithmetic mean ratio (AMR) = 1.21 (95%CI = 1.08; 1.36); p = 0.001), progression to advanced fibrosis (F≥3) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.51 (95%CI = 1.29; 4.88); p = 0.006) and progression to cirrhosis (F4) (OR = 2.71 (95%CI = 0.94; 5.03); p = 0.069). In multivariable analysis, the rs6897932 T allele was related to a higher increase of LSM values during follow-up (adjusted AMR = 1.27 (95%CI = 1.13; 1.42); p&amp;lt;0.001) and higher odds of progression to advanced fibrosis [adjusted OR = 4.46 (95%CI = 1.87; 10.62); p = 0.001], and progression to cirrhosis [adjusted OR = 3.92 (95%CI = 1.30; 11.77); p = 0.015]. Regarding &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and rs3194051 polymorphisms, we did not find significant results except for the relationship between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and the increase in LSM values [adjusted OR = 1.12 (95%CI = 1.02; 1.23); p = 0.015]. The &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs6897932 polymorphism seems to be related to increased risk of liver fibrosis progression in HCV-infected patients. Thus, the rs6897932 polymorphism could be related to the physiopathology of CHC and might be used to successfully stratify the risk of CHC progression.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197115</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>The &amp;lt;i&gt;IL7RA&amp;lt;/i&gt; rs6897932 polymorphism is associated with progression of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C: Repeated measurements design</title><author><name>María Ángeles Jiménez-Sousa</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197115</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by María Ángeles Jiménez-Sousa, Ana Zaida Gómez-Moreno, Daniel Pineda-Tenor, Luz Maria Medrano, Juan José Sánchez-Ruano, Amanda Fernández-Rodríguez, Tomas Artaza-Varasa, José Saura-Montalbán, Sonia Vázquez-Morón, Pablo Ryan, Salvador Resino&lt;/p&gt;

The effects of age on neophobia and exploration are best described in birds and primates, and broader comparisons require reports from other taxa. Here we present data showing age-dependent exploration in a long-lived social species, the common vampire bat (&lt;i&gt;Desmodus rotundus&lt;/i&gt;). A previous study found that vampire bats regurgitated food to partners trapped in a cage. Interestingly, while only a few adult bats visited the trapped bat, in every trial all or most of the eight young males in the colony would visit the trapped bat without feeding it. To test whether this behavioral difference resulted from age class differences in exploration, we compared responses of the bats to a trapped conspecific versus an inanimate novel object. Some adults and young showed interest in trapped conspecifics, but only the young males explored the novel objects. Additional novel object tests in a second captive colony showed that higher rates of novel object exploration were shown by young of both sexes. Our results corroborate past findings from other mammals and birds that age predicts exploration. If age-dependent exploration is indeed adaptive, then the role of age as a predictor of exploration tendency should depend on species-specific life history traits. Finally, because younger vampire bats also appear to have higher exposure to pathogens such as rabies virus, there may be implications for pathogen transmission if younger and more exploratory vampire bats are more likely to feed on novel hosts.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196889</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Younger vampire bats (&amp;lt;i&gt;Desmodus rotundus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) are more likely than adults to explore novel objects</title><author><name>Gerald G.

Here, we present InsituNet, an application that converts &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; sequencing data into interactive network-based visualizations, where each unique transcript is a node in the network and edges represent the spatial co-expression relationships between transcripts.

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time. The model was used to forecast cholera incidence for the months after the passage of the hurricane (October-December 2016) and to predict the impact of a planned oral cholera vaccination campaign. Our first projection, from October 29 to December 31, predicted the highest incidence in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud, accounting for about 45% of the total cases in Haiti. The projection included a second peak in cholera incidence in early December largely driven by heavy rainfall forecasts, confirming the urgency for rapid intervention. A second projection (from November 12 to December 31) used updated rainfall forecasts to estimate that 835 cases would be averted by vaccinations in Grande Anse (90% Prediction Interval [PI] 476-1284) and 995 in Sud (90% PI 508-2043). The experience gained by this modeling effort shows that state-of-the-art computational modeling and data-assimilation methods can produce informative near real-time projections of cholera incidence. Collaboration among modelers and field epidemiologists is indispensable to gain fast access to field data and to translate model results into operational recommendations for emergency management during an outbreak. Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006127</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Damiano Pasetto, Flavio Finger, Anton Camacho, Francesco Grandesso, Sandra Cohuet, Joseph C.

Recent reports have revealed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to arise from cancer stem cells phenotypically similar to physiological hematopoietic stem cells. Myelodysplastic hematopoiesis maintains a hierarchical organization, but the proportion of several hematopoietic compartments is skewed and multiple surface markers are aberrantly expressed. These aberrant antigen expression patterns hold diagnostic and therapeutic promise. However, eradication of MDS requires targeting of early myelodysplasia propagating stem cells. This warrants an exact assessment of the differentiation stage at which aberrant expression occurs in transformed hematopoiesis. Here, we report results on the prospective and extensive dissection of the hematopoietic hierarchy in 20 patients with either low-risk MDS or MDS with excess blasts and compare it to hematopoiesis in patients with non-malignancy-associated cytopenia or B cell lymphoma without bone marrow infiltration. We found patients with MDS with excess blasts to exhibit characteristic expansions of specific immature progenitor compartments. We also identified the aberrant expression of several markers including ALDH, CLL-1, CD44, and CD47 to be specific features of hematopoiesis in MDS with excess blasts. We show that amongst these, aberrant CLL-1 expression manifested at the early uncommitted hematopoietic stem cell level, suggesting a potential role as a therapeutic target.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197823</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Phenotypic characterization of aberrant stem and progenitor cell populations in myelodysplastic syndromes</title><author><name>Benjamin N.

The potential use of bone progenitors, multipotential stromal cells (MSCs) helping spine fusion is increasing, but convenient MSC sources and effective processing methods are critical factors yet to be optimised. The aim of this study was to test the effect of bone marrow processing on the MSC abundance and to compare the differentiation capabilities of vertebral body-bone marrow (VB-BM) MSCs versus iliac crest-bone marrow (IC-BM) MSCs. We assessed the effect of the red blood cell lysis (ammonium chloride, AC) and density-gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep™, LMP), on the extracted VB-BM and IC-BM MSC numbers. The MSC abundance (indicated by colony counts and CD45&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD271&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cell numbers), phenotype, proliferation and tri-lineage differentiation of VB-BM MSCs were compared with donor-matched IC-BM MSCs. Importantly, the MSC attachment and osteogenesis were examined when VB-BM and IC-BM samples were loaded on a beta-tricalcium phosphate scaffold. In contrast to LMP, using AC yielded more colonies from IC-BM and VB-BM aspirates (p = 0.0019 &amp;amp; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0201 respectively). For IC-BM and VB-BM, the colony counts and CD45&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD271&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cell numbers were comparable (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.5186, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.2640 respectively). Furthermore, cultured VB-BM MSCs exhibited the same phenotype, proliferative and adipogenic potential, but a higher osteogenic and chondrogenic capabilities than IC-BM MSCs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0010 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0005 for calcium and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels, respectively). The gene expression data confirmed higher chondrogenesis for VB-BM MSCs than IC-BM MSCs, but osteogenic gene expression levels were comparable. When loaded on Vitoss™, both MSCs showed a similar degree of attachment and survival, but a better osteogenic ability was detected for VB-BM MSCs as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0386). Collectively, the BM processing using AC had more MSC yield than using LMP. VB-BM MSCs have a comparable phenotype and proliferative capacity, but higher chondrogenesis and osteogenesis with or without using scaffold than donor-matched IC-BM MSCs. Given better accessibility, VB-BM could be an ideal MSC source for spinal bone fusion.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197969</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Vertebral body versus iliac crest bone marrow as a source of multipotential stromal cells: Comparison of processing techniques, tri-lineage differentiation and application on a scaffold for spine fusion</title><author><name>Evangelos M.

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main products of indigestible carbohydrates that are fermented by microbiota in the hindgut. This study was designed to investigate the effects of oral SCFAs administration on the lipid metabolism of weaned pigs. A total of 21 barrows were randomly allocated into three groups, including control group (orally infused with 200 mL physiological saline per day), low dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 20.04 mM, propionic acid 7.71 mM and butyric acid 4.89 mM per day), and high dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 40.08 mM, propionic acid 15.42 mM and butyric acid 9.78 mM per day). The results showed that the average daily feed intake of SCFAs groups were lower than that of control group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Oral administration of SCFAs decreased the concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and insulin (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased the leptin concentration in serum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). The total fat, as well as TC and TG levels in liver, was decreased by oral SCFAs administration (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In addition, SCFAs down-regulated the mRNA expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and enhanced the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α) in liver (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). SCFAs also decreased FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor σ mRNA expressions in longissimus dorsi (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). And in abdominal fat, SCFAs reduced FAS and ACC mRNA expressions (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased CPT-1α mRNA expression (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). These results suggested that oral administration of SCFAs could attenuate fat deposition in weaned pigs via reducing lipogenesis and enhancing lipolysis of different tissues.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196867</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Oral administration of short chain fatty acids could attenuate fat deposition of pigs</title><author><name>A.

End-stage renal disease is strongly associated with progressive cardiovascular calcification (CVC) and there is currently no therapy targeted to treat CVC. SNF472 is an experimental formulation under development for treatment of soft tissue calcification. We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of SNF472 administration in rats and its inhibitory effects on CVC. SNF472 was studied in three rat models: (1) prevention of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with an intravenous SNF472 bolus of 1 mg/kg SNF472, (2) inhibition of progression of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with a subcutaneous SNF472 bolus of 10 or 60 mg/kg SNF472, starting after calcification induction, (3) CVC in adenine-induced uremic rats treated with 50 mg/kg SNF472 via i.v. 4h -infusion. Uremic rats presented lower plasma levels of SNF472 than control animals after i.v. infusion. CVC in non-uremic rats was inhibited by 60–70% after treatment with SNF472 and progression of cardiac calcification completely blocked. Development of CVC in uremic rats was inhibited by up to 80% following i.v. infusion of SNF472. SNF472 inhibits the development and progression of CVC in uremic and non-uremic rats in the same range of SNF472 plasma levels but using in each case the required dose to obtain those levels. These results collectively support the development of SNF472 as a novel therapeutic option for treatment of CVC in humans.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197061</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Characterization of SNF472 pharmacokinetics and efficacy in uremic and non-uremic rats models of cardiovascular calcification</title><author><name>Miguel D.

Many tumors are characterized by genetic instability, producing an assortment of genetic variants of tumor cells called subclones. These tumors and their surrounding environments form complex multi-cellular ecosystems, where subclones compete for resources and cooperate to perform multiple tasks, including cancer invasion. Our recent empirical studies revealed existence of such distinct phenotypes of cancer cells, leaders and followers, in lung cancer. These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. This class can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast these manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZu0gxkmVxM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006131</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seth Haney, Jessica Konen, Adam I.

In recent years, effective treatment of infections caused by &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; has become challenging due to the ability of the bacterium to acquire or up-regulate antimicrobial resistance determinants. Two component signal transduction systems are known to regulate expression of virulence factors including multidrug efflux pumps. Here, we investigated the role of the AdeRS two component signal transduction system in regulating the AdeAB efflux system, determined whether AdeA and/or AdeB can individually confer antimicrobial resistance, and explored the interplay between pentamidine resistance and growth conditions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 17978. Results identified that deletion of &lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; affected resistance towards chlorhexidine and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, two previously defined AdeABC substrates, and also identified an 8-fold decrease in resistance to pentamidine. Examination of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt;, Δ&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and Δ&lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; cells augmented results seen for Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; and identified a set of dicationic AdeAB substrates. RNA-sequencing of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; revealed transcription of 290 genes were ≥2-fold altered compared to the wildtype. Pentamidine shock significantly increased &lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt; expression in the wildtype, but decreased it in Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt;, implying that AdeRS activates &lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; transcription in ATCC 17978. Investigation under multiple growth conditions, including the use of Biolog phenotypic microarrays, revealed resistance to pentamidine in ATCC 17978 and mutants could be altered by bioavailability of iron or utilization of different carbon sources. In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that AdeAB in ATCC 17978 can confer intrinsic resistance to a subset of dicationic compounds and in particular, resistance to pentamidine can be significantly altered depending on the growth conditions.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197412</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Resistance to pentamidine is mediated by AdeAB, regulated by AdeRS, and influenced by growth conditions in &amp;lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&amp;lt;/i&gt; ATCC 17978</title><author><name>Felise G.

In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that AdeAB in ATCC 17978 can confer intrinsic resistance to a subset of dicationic compounds and in particular, resistance to pentamidine can be significantly altered depending on the growth conditions.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526072400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197412</link><fingerprint>3be07326</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f81:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197412</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525133112940</crawled><description>There is growing interest in using genetic variants to augment the reference genome into a &amp;quot;graph genome&amp;quot; to improve read alignment accuracy and reduce allelic bias.

First discovered for their role in mediating programmed cell death and inflammatory responses, caspases have now emerged as crucial regulators of other cellular and physiological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. In the developing nervous system, for instance, the non-apoptotic functions of caspases have been shown to play critical roles in the formation of neuronal circuits by regulating axon outgrowth, guidance and pruning. How caspase activity is spatially and temporally maintained at sub-lethal levels within cells remains however poorly understood, especially in vivo. Thanks to its transparency and accessibility, the zebrafish offers the unique ability to directly visualize caspase activation in vivo. Yet, detailed information about the caspase family in zebrafish is lacking. Here, we report the identification and characterization of 19 different caspase genes in zebrafish, and show that caspases have diverse expression profiles from cleavage to larval stages, suggesting highly specialized and/or redundant functions during embryonic development.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197966</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Characterization of the caspase family in zebrafish</title><author><name>Olivia Spead</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197966</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Olivia Spead, Tine Verreet, Cory J.

Information on circulating miRNAs in frontotemporal lobar degeneration is very limited and conflicting results have complicated an interpretation in Alzheimer’s disease thus far. In the present study we I) collected samples from multiple clinical centers across Germany, II) defined 3 homogenous patient groups with high sample sizes (bvFTD n = 48, AD n = 48 and cognitively healthy controls n = 44), III) compared expression levels in both CSF and serum samples and IV) detected a limited set of miRNAs by using a MIQE compliant protocol based on SYBR-green miRCURY assays that have proven reliable to generate reproducible results. We included several quality controls that identified and reduced technical variation to increase the reliability of our data. We showed that the expression levels of circulating miRNAs measured in CSF did not correlate with levels in serum. Using cluster analysis we found expression pattern in serum that, in part, reflects the genomic organization and affiliation to a specific miRNA family and that were specifically altered in bvFTD, AD, and control groups. Applying factor analysis we identified a 3-factor model characterized by a miRNA signature that explained 80% of the variance classifying healthy controls with 97%, bvFTD with 77% and AD with 72% accuracy. MANOVA confirmed signals like miR-320a and miR-26b-5p at BH corrected significance that contributed most to discriminate bvFTD cases with 96% sensitivity and 90% specificity and AD cases with 89% sensitivity and specificity compared to healthy controls, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that miRNAs from the 3-factor model also correlated with levels of protein biomarker amyloid-beta&lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, indicating their potential role in the monitoring of progressive neuronal degeneration. Our data show that miRNAs can be reproducibly measured in serum and CSF without pre-amplification and that serum includes higher expressed signals that demonstrate an overall better ability to classify bvFTD, AD and healthy controls compared to signals detected in CSF.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197329</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Specific serum and CSF microRNA profiles distinguish sporadic behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia compared with Alzheimer patients and cognitively healthy controls</title><author><name>Johannes Denk</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197329</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Johannes Denk, Felix Oberhauser, Johannes Kornhuber, Jens Wiltfang, Klaus Fassbender, Matthias L.

In addition, while genome-wide binding patterns must ultimately be determined by local constellations of binding sites in the DNA, current analysis is typically limited to a standard search for enriched motifs in ChIP-seq peaks. Here we present Crunch, a completely automated computational method that performs all ChIP-seq analysis from quality control through read mapping and peak detecting, and integrates comprehensive modeling of the ChIP signal in terms of known and novel binding motifs, quantifying the contribution of each motif, and annotating which combinations of motifs explain each binding peak. Applying Crunch to 128 ChIP-seq datasets from the ENCODE project we find that TFs naturally separate into `solitary TFs&apos;, for which a single motif explains the ChIP-peaks, and `co-binding TFs&apos; for which multiple motifs co-occur within peaks. Moreover, for most datasets the motifs that Crunch identified de novo outperform known motifs and both the set of co-binding motifs and the top motif of solitary TFs are consistent across experiments and cell lines. Crunch is implemented as a web server (crunch.unibas.ch), enabling standardized analysis of any collection of ChIP-seq datasets by simply uploading raw sequencing data. Results are provided both in a graphical interface and as downloadable files.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/042903v2?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/08/042903</canonicalUrl><title>Crunch: Integrated processing and modeling of ChIP-seq data in terms of regulatory motifs [NEW RESULTS]</title><author><name>Berger, S.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/042903v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Although it has become routine for experimental groups to apply ChIP-seq technology to quantitatively characterize the genome-wide binding of transcription factors (TFs), computational analysis procedures remain far from standardized, making it difficult to meaningfully compare ChIP-seq results across experiments. In addition, while genome-wide binding patterns must ultimately be determined by local constellations of binding sites in the DNA, current analysis is typically limited to a standard search for enriched motifs in ChIP-seq peaks. Here we present Crunch, a completely automated computational method that performs all ChIP-seq analysis from quality control through read mapping and peak detecting, and integrates comprehensive modeling of the ChIP signal in terms of known and novel binding motifs, quantifying the contribution of each motif, and annotating which combinations of motifs explain each binding peak. Applying Crunch to 128 ChIP-seq datasets from the ENCODE project we find that TFs naturally separate into `solitary TFs&apos;, for which a single motif explains the ChIP-peaks, and `co-binding TFs&apos; for which multiple motifs co-occur within peaks.

Hybrid triploid loaches (&lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt;) were generated from natural tetraploid and diploid loaches. We studied the gonads of parents and offspring from direct and reciprocal crosses through histological and transcriptome analyses. The triploid offspring had inferior ability to form sperm and egg cells compared with diploid forms. After sequencing the transcriptomes, 655,109,158 clean reads were obtained, and 62,821 unigenes and 178,962 transcripts were assembled. Of these unigenes, 23,189 were annotated in the GO database, 18,525 in the KEGG database and 24,661 in the KOG database. 36 fertility-related genes were found to be differentially expressed between the direct cross (2n × 4n) progenies and their parents, while 53 fertility-related genes between the reciprocal cross (4n × 2n) progenies and their parents. Following protein-protein interaction network analyses, 54 differentially expressed genes, including &lt;i&gt;PLCB4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cyp17a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pla2g4d&lt;/i&gt;, were mined, yielding candidate genes involved in the poor fertility of hybrid triploid loaches. This is the first report of transcriptomes of gonads of hybrid triploid loaches and their parents, offering a substantial contribution to sequence resources for this species and providing a deep insight into the molecular mechanism controlling the fertility of hybrid triploid fish.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198179</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Gonadal transcriptome analysis of hybrid triploid loaches (&amp;lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) and their diploid and tetraploid parents</title><author><name>He Zhou</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198179</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by He Zhou, Qi-Zheng Xu, Rui Zhang, Zi-Xin Zhuang, Yin-Qiang Ma, Wei Wang, Tian-Yu Ma, Yi Sui, Yang Liu, Xiaojuan Cao&lt;/p&gt;

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is modeled to explore the mechanisms of this effective, but poorly understood, treatment for motor symptoms of drug-refractory Parkinson’s disease and dystonia. First, a neural field model of the corticothalamic-basal ganglia (CTBG) system is developed that reproduces key clinical features of Parkinson’s disease, including its characteristic 4–8 Hz and 13–30 Hz electrophysiological signatures. Deep brain stimulation of the STN is then modeled and shown to suppress the pathological 13–30 Hz (beta) activity for physiologically realistic and optimized stimulus parameters. This supports the idea that suppression of abnormally coherent activity in the CTBG system is a major factor in DBS therapy for Parkinson’s disease, by permitting normal dynamics to resume. At high stimulus intensities, nonlinear effects in the target population mediate wave-wave interactions between resonant beta activity and the stimulus pulse train, leading to complex spectral structure that shows remarkable similarity to that seen in steady-state evoked potential experiments.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nyh-p6NdIb8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006217</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eli J.

We previously identified brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a source of sleep-inducing signals. Pharmacological activation of BAT enhances sleep while sleep loss leads to increased BAT thermogenesis. Recovery sleep after sleep loss is diminished in mice that lack uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), and also in wild-type (WT) mice after sensory denervation of the BAT. Systemic inflammation greatly affects metabolism and the function of adipose tissue, and also induces characteristic sleep responses. We hypothesized that sleep responses to acute inflammation are mediated by BAT-derived signals. To test this, we determined the effects of systemic inflammation on sleep and body temperature in UCP-1 knockout (KO) and WT mice. Intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 beta and clodronate containing liposomes were used to induce systemic inflammation. In WT animals, non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) was elevated in all four inflammatory models. All NREMS responses were completely abolished in UCP-1 KO animals. Systemic inflammation elicited an initial hypothermia followed by fever in WT mice. The hypothermic phase, but not the fever, was abolished in UCP-1 KO mice. The only recognized function of UCP-1 is to promote thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Present results indicate that the presence of UCP-1 is necessary for increased NREMS but does not contribute to the development of fever in systemic inflammation.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197409</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Brown adipose tissue plays a central role in systemic inflammation-induced sleep responses</title><author><name>Éva Szentirmai</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197409</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Éva Szentirmai, Levente Kapás&lt;/p&gt;

Adult male C57BL/6J mice have previously been reported to have motor and memory deficits after experimental closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI), without associated gross pathologic damage or neuroimaging changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging protocols. The presence of neurologic deficits, however, suggests neural damage or dysfunction in these animals. Accordingly, we undertook a histologic analysis of mice after TBI. Gross pathology and histologic analysis using Nissl stain and NeuN immunohistochemistry demonstrated no obvious tissue damage or neuron loss. However, Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed myelin injury in the optic tract, while Fluoro Jade B and silver degeneration staining revealed evidence of axonal neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and superior colliculus (detectable at 7 days, but not 24 hours, after injury). Fluoro Jade B staining was not detectable in other white matter tracts, brain regions or in cell somata. In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197346</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Optic tract injury after closed head traumatic brain injury in mice: A model of indirect traumatic optic neuropathy</title><author><name>Nathan K.

Mesothelin is a cell surface protein that is overexpressed in numerous cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, liver, and pancreatic tumors. Aberrant expression of mesothelin has been shown to promote tumor progression and metastasis through interaction with established tumor biomarker CA125. Therefore, molecules that specifically bind to mesothelin have potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, no mesothelin-targeting molecules are currently approved for routine clinical use. While antibodies that target mesothelin are in development, some clinical applications may require a targeting molecule with an alternative protein fold. For example, non-antibody proteins are more suitable for molecular imaging and may facilitate diverse chemical conjugation strategies to create drug delivery complexes. In this work, we engineered variants of the fibronectin type III domain (Fn3) non-antibody protein scaffold to bind to mesothelin with high affinity, using directed evolution and yeast surface display. Lead engineered Fn3 variants were solubly produced and purified from bacterial culture at high yield. Upon specific binding to mesothelin on human cancer cell lines, the engineered Fn3 proteins internalized and co-localized to early endosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-antibody proteins engineered to bind mesothelin. The results validate that non-antibody proteins can be engineered to bind to tumor biomarker mesothelin, and encourage the continued development of engineered variants for applications such as targeted diagnostics and therapeutics.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197029</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Fn3 proteins engineered to recognize tumor biomarker mesothelin internalize upon binding</title><author><name>Allison R.

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can harm the embryonic development and cause life-long consequences in offspring’s health. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of PAE we have used a mouse model of early alcohol exposure, which is based on maternal &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; ingestion of 10% (v/v) ethanol for the first eight days of gestation (GD 0.5–8.5). Owing to the detected postnatal growth-restricted phenotype in the offspring of this mouse model and both prenatal and postnatal growth restriction in alcohol-exposed humans, we focused on imprinted genes &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like growth factor 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Igf2)&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide N&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Paternally expressed gene 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Peg3)&lt;/i&gt;, which all are known to be involved in embryonic and placental growth and development. We studied the effects of alcohol on DNA methylation level at the &lt;i&gt;Igf2/H19&lt;/i&gt; imprinting control region (ICR), &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; differentially methylated region 1, &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; ICR and &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; ICR in 9.5 embryonic days old (E9.5) embryos and placentas by using MassARRAY EpiTYPER. To determine alcohol-induced alterations globally, we also examined methylation in long interspersed nuclear elements (Line-1) in E9.5 placentas. We did not observe any significant alcohol-induced changes in DNA methylation levels. We explored effects of PAE on gene expression of E9.5 embryos as well as E9.5 and E16.5 placentas by using quantitative PCR. The expression of growth promoter gene &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; was decreased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas. The expression of negative growth controller &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt; was significantly increased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos compared to controls, and conversely, a trend of decreased expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas were observed. Furthermore, increased &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos was also detected. Our study indicates that albeit no alterations in the DNA methylation levels of studied sequences were detected by EpiTYPER, early PAE can affect the expression of imprinted genes in both developing embryo and placenta.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Early prenatal alcohol exposure alters imprinted gene expression in placenta and embryo in a mouse model</title><author><name>Heidi Marjonen</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Heidi Marjonen, Mia Toivonen, Laura Lahti, Nina Kaminen-Ahola&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emerged in Aruba for the first time in 2014. We studied the clinical presentation of acute CHIKV infection and the contribution of serologic and molecular assays to its diagnosis. In a cohort of confirmed CHIKV cases, we analysed the frequency, duration and predictors of post-chikungunya chronic polyarthralgia (pCHIK-CPA), defined as joint pains lasting longer than 6 weeks or longer than 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;Patient sera obtained within 10 days of symptom onset were tested for CHIKV, using an indirect immunofluorescence test for the detection of CHIKV-specific Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and post-hoc, by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CHIKV was isolated from selected samples and genotyped. For confirmed CHIKV cases, clinical data from chart review were complemented by a Telephone survey, conducted 18–24 months after diagnosis. When joint pain was reported, the duration, presence of inflammatory signs, type and number of joints affected, were recorded. Joint involvement was scored according to the 2010 ‘American College of Rheumatology/ European League Against Rheumatism’ criteria for seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (ACR-score). Risk factors for pCHIK-CPA were identified by logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt; Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Acute CHIKV infection was diagnosed in 269 of 498 sera, by detection of IgM (n = 105), by RT-PCR (n = 59), or by both methods (n = 105). Asian genotype was confirmed in 7 samples. Clinical data were complete for 171 of 248 (69.0%) patients, aged 15 years or older (median 49.4 [35.0–59.6]). The female-to-male ratio was 2.2. The main acute symptoms were arthralgia (94%), fever (85%), myalgia (85%), headache (73%) and rash (63%). In patients with arthralgia (n = 160), pCHIK-CPA longer than 6 weeks was reported by 44% and longer than 1 year by 26% of cases. Inflammatory signs, stiffness, edema and redness were frequent (71%, 39% and 21%, respectively). Joints involved were knees (66%), ankles (50%), fingers (52%), feet (46%), shoulders (36%), elbows (34%), wrists (35%), hips (31%), toes (28.1%) and spine (28.1%). Independent predictors of pCHIK-CPA longer than 1 year were female gender (OR 5.9, 95%-CI [2.1–19.6]); high ACR-score (7.4, [2.7–23.3]), and detection of CHIKV-RNA in serum beyond 7 days of symptom onset (6.4, [1.4–34.1].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We identified 269 CHIKV patients after the first outbreak of Asian genotype CHIKV in Aruba in 2014–2015.

Background &lt;p&gt;Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emerged in Aruba for the first time in 2014. We studied the clinical presentation of acute CHIKV infection and the contribution of serologic and molecular assays to its diagnosis.

Immunogenicity is a major concern in drug development as anti-drug antibodies in many cases affect both patient safety and drug efficacy. Another concern is often the limited half-life of drugs, which can be altered by different chemical modifications, like acylation with fatty acids. However, acylation with fatty acids has been shown in some cases to modulate T cell activation. Therefore, to understand the role of acylation with fatty acids on immunogenicity we tested three immunogenic non-acylated peptides and 14 of their acylated analogues for binding to 26 common HLA class II alleles, and their ability to activate T cells in an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; T cell assay. Changes in binding affinity associated with acylation with fatty acids were typically modest, though a significant decrease was observed for influenza HA acylated with a stearic acid, and affinities for DQ alleles were consistently increased. Importantly, we showed that for all three immunogenic peptides acylation with fatty acids decreased their capacity to activate T cells, a trend particularly evident with longer fatty acids typically positioned within the peptide HLA class II binding core region, or when closer to the C-terminus. With these results we have demonstrated that acylation with fatty acids of immunogenic peptides can lower their stimulatory capacity, which could be important knowledge for drug design and immunogenicity mitigation.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197407</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>The effect of acylation with fatty acids and other modifications on HLA class II:peptide binding and T cell stimulation for three model peptides</title><author><name>Heidi S.

This study describes differences in species richness and composition of the assemblages of galling insects and their host plants at different spatial scales. Sampling was conducted along altitudinal gradients composed of &lt;i&gt;campos rupestres&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;campos de altitude&lt;/i&gt; of two mountain complexes in southeastern Brazil: Espinhaço Range and Mantiqueira Range. The following hypotheses were tested: i) local and regional richness of host plants and galling insects are positively correlated; ii) beta diversity is the most important component of regional diversity of host plants and galling insects; and iii) Turnover is the main mechanism driving beta diversity of both host plants and galling insects. Local richness of galling insects and host plants increased with increasing regional richness of species, suggesting a pattern of unsaturated communities. The additive partition of regional richness (γ) into local and beta components shows that local richnesses (α) of species of galling insects and host plants are low relative to regional richness; the beta (β) component incorporates most of the regional richness. The multi-scale analysis of additive partitioning showed similar patterns for galling insects and host plants with the local component (α) incorporated a small part of regional richness. Beta diversity of galling insects and host plants were mainly the result of turnover, with little contribution from nesting. Although the species composition of galling insects and host plant species varied among sample sites, mountains and even mountain ranges, local richness remained relatively low. In this way, the addition of local habitats with different landscapes substantially affects regional richness. Each mountain contributes fundamentally to the composition of regional diversity of galling insects and host plants, and so the design of future conservation strategies should incorporate multiple scales.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195565</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Species turnover drives &amp;lt;i&gt;β&amp;lt;/i&gt;-diversity patterns across multiple spatial scales of plant-galling interactions in mountaintop grasslands</title><author><name>Marcel Serra Coelho</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195565</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marcel Serra Coelho, Marco Antônio Alves Carneiro, Cristina Alves Branco, Rafael Augusto Xavier Borges, Geraldo Wilson Fernandes&lt;/p&gt;

NTC was able to efficiently prevent worm development at very low concentrations, and the worms expressing &lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; were able to survive on the selection plates without any developmental defects. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and NTC selection, we were able to easily insert a 13-kb expression cassette into a defined locus in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. The structure and spectrum of NTC differs from other antibiotics like hygromycin B and geneticin, making it possible to use NTC alongside them. Indeed, we confirmed NTC-&lt;i&gt;sat2&lt;/i&gt; selection could work with the hygromycin B selection system simultaneously.

Thus, the new NTC–&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; system can act as a useful dominant marker for gene transfer and genome editing in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525899600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197128</link><fingerprint>2f1c4bbd</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee4:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197128</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1525807602634</crawled><description>Native cell-free transcription–translation systems offer a rapid route to characterize the regulatory elements (promoters, transcription factors) for gene expression from nonmodel microbial hosts, which can be difficult to assess through traditional in vivo approaches.

Background &lt;p&gt;Paritaprevir inhibits organic anion–transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3, which transport bilirubin. Hyperbilirubinemia is an adverse event reported during hepatitis C treatment. Gadoxetic acid is also transported by OATP1B1/1B3. We evaluated whether the enhancement effect in gadoxetic acid–enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging could predict the plasma concentration of paritaprevir and might anticipate the development of hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective study evaluated 27 patients with hepatitis C who underwent gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging prior to treatment with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir. The contrast enhancement index (CEI), a measure of liver enhancement during the hepatobiliary phase, was assessed. Plasma trough concentrations, and concentrations at 2, 4, and 6 h after dosing were determined 7 d after the start of treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven patients (26%) developed hyperbilirubinemia (≥ 1.6 mg/dl). Paritaprevir trough concentration (C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt;) was significantly higher in patients with hyperbilirubinemia than in those without (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022). We found an inverse relationship between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; (r = 0.612, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), while there was not a significantly weak inverse relationship between AUC&lt;sub&gt;0–6 h&lt;/sub&gt; and CEI (r = −0.338, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.085). The partial correlation coefficient between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; was −0.425 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.034), while excluding the effects of albumin and the FIB-4 index. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the CEI was relatively accurate in predicting hyperbilirubinemia, with area under the ROC of 0.882. Multivariate analysis showed that the CEI &amp;lt; 1.61 was the only independent predictor related to the development of hyperbilirubinemia, with an odds ratio of 9.08 (95% confidence interval 1.05–78.86, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hepatic enhancement with gadoxetic acid was independently related to paritaprevir concentration and was an independent pretreatment factor in predicting hyperbilirubinemia. Gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging can therefore be useful in determining the risk of paritaprevir-induced hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196747</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Gadoxetic acid–enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to predict paritaprevir-induced hyperbilirubinemia during treatment of hepatitis C</title><author><name>Hironao Okubo</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196747</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hironao Okubo, Hitoshi Ando, Yushi Sorin, Eisuke Nakadera, Hiroo Fukada, Junichi Morishige, Akihisa Miyazaki, Kenichi Ikejima&lt;/p&gt;

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the detrimental effects of intramedullary reaming used in conventional TKA for distal femur cutting are of concern. Avoiding intramedullary reaming with the use of computer-assisted navigation TKA can not only provide superior prosthetic alignment, but also mitigate perioperative blood loss and the dissipation of marrow emboli. We quantified local and systemic concentrations of inflammation markers for both techniques. Forty-four participants undergoing computer-assisted navigation and 53 receiving conventional TKA for advanced knee OA were recruited between 2013/02/08 and 2015/12/09. Blood samples were collected from all participants at baseline then again at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed by ELISA for interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1); these markers were also measured in Hemovac drain fluid collected at 24 and 72 hours. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β1(unit for all markers: pg/mL) were increased from baseline by smaller increments in the navigation TKA cohort compared with the conventional TKA group at 24 hours (17.06 vs 29.39, p = 0.02; 0.51 vs 0.83, p = 0.16; –0.04 vs 0.36, p &amp;lt; 0.01 and –48.18 vs 63.24, p&amp;lt; 0.01, respectively) and at 72 hours (12.27 vs 16.87, p = 0.01; –0.40 vs 0.48, p &amp;lt; 0.01; 0.58 vs 0.98, p = 0.07 and –55.16 vs 63.71, p &amp;lt; 0.01, respectively). IL-10 levels in drainage fluids collected 24 hours after TKA were also significantly lower in the navigation group versus the conventional TKA group (8.55 vs 12.32, p &amp;lt; 0.01). According to our evidence, the merits of computer-assisted navigation TKA are augmented by low levels of inflammation markers.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197097</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Effects of computer-assisted navigation versus conventional total knee arthroplasty on the levels of inflammation markers: A prospective study</title><author><name>Shu-Jui Kuo</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197097</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shu-Jui Kuo, Horng-Chaung Hsu, Ching-Jen Wang, Ka-Kit Siu, Ya-Hung Hsu, Jih-Yang Ko, Chih-Hsin Tang&lt;/p&gt;

HIV acquisition during pregnancy and breastfeeding significantly contributes toward paediatric HIV infection; however, little is known about risk behaviours in HIV-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted twenty-six in-depth-interviews between July and December 2016 using a semi-structured interview guide among HIV-uninfected pregnant and recently postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition (defined as reporting ≥1 of the following: partner’s serostatus unknown or HIV-infected, recent condomless sex in pregnancy, and/or alcohol use during pregnancy) who attended primary healthcare services. Our study contextualizes factors related to risky sexual behaviours during pregnancy and postpartum periods and assesses knowledge and hypothetical acceptability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnancy. Translated and transcribed data were coded and analysed by three researchers using a thematic analysis approach. In interviews with HIV-uninfected pregnant/postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition, we identified common themes associated with sexual risk behaviours during pregnancy, including: lack of control over decisions in sex and condom use in pregnancy, low perceived risk (e.g. beliefs that their partner has the same HIV-negative serostatus), and socio-cultural beliefs around condom use during pregnancy (e.g. contact with sperm is essential for baby’s development). PrEP knowledge was low among HIV-uninfected pregnant and breastfeeding women, and potential acceptability was good, though primary concerns were around the potential impact on the infant. While mothers presented a clear desire to protect themselves from HIV acquisition once pregnant, they also reported lack of control, and socio-cultural beliefs, like sex is good for the baby, that increased their risk of seroconversion. Mothers had limited PrEP awareness but reported hypothetical willingness to use PrEP because of concerns over HIV acquisition and onward mother to child transmission.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197143</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Risk perception and sex behaviour in pregnancy and breastfeeding in high HIV prevalence settings: Programmatic implications for PrEP delivery</title><author><name>Dvora Joseph Davey</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197143</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dvora Joseph Davey, Elise Farley, Catriona Towriss, Yolanda Gomba, Linda-Gail Bekker, Pamina Gorbach, Steven Shoptaw, Thomas Coates, Landon Myer&lt;/p&gt;

NANOG has been demonstrated to play an essential role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells, and its pseudogene, NANOGP8, is suggested to promote the cancer stem cell phenotype. As the roles of these genes are intimately involved with glioblastoma multiforme progression and exosomes are critical in intercellular communication, we conducted a detailed analysis of the association of the NANOG gene family with exosomes to identify diagnostic markers for cancer. Exosomes were precipitated from conditioned culture media from various cell lines, and NANOG gene fragments were directly amplified without DNA isolation using multiple primer sets. The use of the enzymes AlwNI and SmaI with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis functioned to distinguish NANOGP8 from other NANOG family members. Collectively, results suggest that the NANOG DNA associated with exosomes is not full length and that mixed populations of the NANOG gene family exist. Furthermore, sequence analysis of exosomal DNA amplified with a NANOGP8 specific primer set frequently showed an insertion of a 22 bp sequence into the 3’ UTR. The occurrence rate of this insertion was significantly higher in exosomal DNA clones from cancer cells as compared to normal cells. We have detected mixed populations of NANOG DNA associated with exosomes and have identified preferential modulations in the sequences from cancer samples. Our findings, coupled with the properties of exosomes, may allow for the detection of traditionally inaccessible cancers (i.e. GBM) through minimally invasive techniques. Further analysis of exosomal DNA sequences of NANOG and other embryonic stemness genes (OCT3/4, SOX2, etc.) may establish a robust collection of exosome based diagnostic markers, and further elucidate the mechanisms of cancer formation, progression, and metastasis.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197782</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Differential sequences of exosomal NANOG DNA as a potential diagnostic cancer marker</title><author><name>Manjusha Vaidya</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197782</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Manjusha Vaidya, Michael Bacchus, Kiminobu Sugaya&lt;/p&gt;

In mountainous landscapes, soil moisture is highly dynamic due to the effects of topography and the temporal variability imposed by seasonal precipitation, including rainfall and snow. Soil moisture is known to affect ecosystem carbon exchange both aboveground and belowground, as well as the stable isotopic composition of exchanged CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In mountainous landscapes, soil moisture is highly dynamic due to the effects of topography and the temporal variability imposed by seasonal precipitation, including rainfall and snow. Soil moisture is known to affect ecosystem carbon exchange both aboveground and belowground, as well as the stable isotopic composition of exchanged CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this study we used an extensive suite of measurements to examine the effects of seasonal changes in soil moisture on the isotopic composition of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production at the landscape level. We show that the seasonal decline in soil moisture (i.e., summer dry-down) appeared to impose a trend in the δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) with more negative δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; early in the growing season when soils were wet, and more positive δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; as the growing season progressed and soils dried out. This seemingly generalizable pattern for a snow-dominated watershed is likely to represent the variability of recently assimilated C, tracked through the plant-soil system and imprinted in the respired CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, our observations suggest that, at least for mountainous environments, seasonal changes in δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; are largely mediated by soil moisture and their spatial variability is partially organized by topography.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525986000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197471</link><fingerprint>8a048ceb</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0f1:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197471</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/690?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/690.full</canonicalUrl><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395e1:3dd877af</id><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/690?rss=1</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Scientific Community</item></keywords><unread>True</unread><published>1526578752000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/690?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>d0e89fe9</fingerprint><title>News at a glance</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><crawled>1527011881206</crawled><description>Clustering techniques are widely used in the analysis of large data sets to group together samples with similar properties. For example, clustering is often used in the field of single-cell RNA- sequencing in order to identify different cell types present in a tissue sample. There are many algorithms for performing clustering and the results can vary substantially. In particular, the number of groups present in a data set is often unknown and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution we present clustering trees.

Thiols can be deprotonated to form a thiolate, which affords a diverse range of enzymatic activity and modes for chemical modification of proteins. Parameters for modeling thiolates using molecular mechanical force fields have not yet been validated, in part due to the lack of structural data on thiolate solvation. Here, the CHARMM36 and Amber models for thiolates in aqueous solutions are assessed using free energy perturbation and QM/MM MD simulations. The hydration structure of methylthiolate was calculated from 1 ns of QM/MM MD (PBE0/def2-TZVP//TIP3P), which show that the water–S- distances are approximately 2 Å. The CHARMM thiolate parameters predict a thiolate S radius close to the QM/MM value and predict a hydration Gibbs energy of -331 kJ/mol, close to the experimental value of -318 kJ/mol. The cysteine thiolate model in the Amber force field underestimates the thiolate radius by 0.2 Å and overestimates the thiolate hydration energy by 119 kJ/mol because it uses the same Lennard-Jones parameters for thiolates as for thiols. A recent Drude polarizable model for methylthiolate with optimized thiolate parameters also performs well. SAPT2+ analysis indicates exchange repulsion is larger for the methylthiolate, consistent with it having a more diffuse electron density distribution in comparison to the parent thiol. These data demonstrate that it is important to define distinct non-bonded parameters for the protonated/deprotonated states of amino acid side chains in molecular mechanical force fields.</description><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Hydration_Structure_of_Methylthiolate_from_QM_MM_Molecular_Dynamics/6199340</originId><origin><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16316e7a331:1de079a:11c251fd</id><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Hydration_Structure_of_Methylthiolate_from_QM_MM_Molecular_Dynamics/6199340</href></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><published>1525046400000</published><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Hydration_Structure_of_Methylthiolate_from_QM_MM_Molecular_Dynamics/6199340</link><fingerprint>9e882750</fingerprint><title>The Hydration Structure of Methylthiolate from QM/MM Molecular Dynamics</title><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Thiols are widely present in biological systems, most notably as the side chain of cysteine amino acids in proteins.

The behaviour of most animals has evolved in a communication network environment, in which signals produced by senders are perceived by many intended and unintended receivers. In this study, we tested whether the corncrake (&lt;i&gt;Crex crex&lt;/i&gt;), a nocturnal rail species with innate (non-learned) calls, is able to eavesdrop on the interactions of conspecific males and how this eavesdropping affects subsequent responses by the eavesdropper to territorial intrusion. In the first step, simulated aggressive or neutral interactions between male dyads were presented to a focal male. In the second step, the calls of winning, losing or neutral males from the first step were played within the territory of the focal male. We measured behavioural and vocal responses of focal males. We found that corncrakes eavesdropped on signal exchange between rivals. Males often began responding to distant aggressive interactions during the eavesdropping phase, and they responded strongly during the intrusion phase of the experiments. The response was significantly weaker to playback of males from neutral interactions than to those involved in aggressive interactions, and we found no differences between the responses to Winners and Losers entering a focal male territory.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197368</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>A nocturnal rail with a simple territorial call eavesdrops on interactions between rivals</title><author><name>Lucyna Ewa Wojas</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197368</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lucyna Ewa Wojas, Paweł Wojciech Podkowa, Tomasz Stanisław Osiejuk&lt;/p&gt;

We determined the filtered tree species pool of Amazonian wetland forests, based on confirmed occurrence records, to better understand how tree diversity in wetland environments compares to tree diversity in the entire Amazon region. The tree species pool was determined using data from two main sources: 1) a compilation of published tree species lists plus one unpublished list of our own, derived from tree plot inventories and floristic surveys; 2) queries on botanical collections that include Amazonian flora, curated by herbaria and available through the SpeciesLink digital biodiversity database. We applied taxonomic name resolution and determined sample-based species accumulation curves for both datasets, to estimate sampling effort and predict the expected species richness using Chao’s analytical estimators. We report a total of 3 615 valid tree species occurring in Amazonian wetland forests. After surveying almost 70 years of research efforts to inventory the diversity of Amazonian wetland trees, we found that 74% these records were registered in published species lists (2 688 tree species). Tree species richness estimates predicted from either single dataset underestimated the total pooled species richness recorded as occurring in Amazonian wetlands, with only 41% of the species shared by both datasets. The filtered tree species pool of Amazonian wetland forests comprises 53% of the 6 727 tree species taxonomically confirmed for the Amazonian tree flora to date. This large proportion is likely to be the result of significant species interchange among forest habitats within the Amazon region, as well as &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; speciation processes due to strong ecological filtering. The provided tree species pool raises the number of tree species previously reported as occurring in Amazonian wetlands by a factor of 3.2.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198130</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>The tree species pool of Amazonian wetland forests: Which species can assemble in periodically waterlogged habitats?</title><author><name>Bruno Garcia Luize</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198130</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Garcia Luize, José Leonardo Lima Magalhães, Helder Queiroz, Maria Aparecida Lopes, Eduardo Martins Venticinque, Evlyn Márcia Leão de Moraes Novo, Thiago Sanna Freire Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Tree species richness estimates predicted from either single dataset underestimated the total pooled species richness recorded as occurring in Amazonian wetlands, with only 41% of the species shared by both datasets. The filtered tree species pool of Amazonian wetland forests comprises 53% of the 6 727 tree species taxonomically confirmed for the Amazonian tree flora to date. This large proportion is likely to be the result of significant species interchange among forest habitats within the Amazon region, as well as &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; speciation processes due to strong ecological filtering. The provided tree species pool raises the number of tree species previously reported as occurring in Amazonian wetlands by a factor of 3.2.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1527627600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198130</link><fingerprint>2a2b2d08</fingerprint><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c20:3dd877af</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><crawled>1527492817805</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021944?af=R</originId><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Theoretical prediction of crystallization kinetics of a supercooled Lennard-Jones fluid</title><author><name>K.

The ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 degrade extracellular ATP to adenosine. ATP is released by stressed or damaged cells and provides pro-inflammatory signals to immune cells through P2 receptors. Adenosine, on the other hand, suppresses immune cells by stimulating P1 receptors. Thus, CD39 and CD73 can shape the quality of immune responses. Here we demonstrate that upregulation of CD39 is a consistent feature of activated conventional CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Following stimulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells from human blood gained surface expression of CD39 but displayed only low levels of CD73. Activated human T cells from inflamed joints largely presented with a CD39&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD73&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype. In line, in spleens of mice with acute &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, listeria-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells acquired a CD39&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD73&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype. To test the function of CD39 in control of bacterial infection, CD39-deficient (CD39&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) mice were infected with &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;.

In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CD39 is upregulated on conventional CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells at sites of acute infection and inflammation, and that CD39 dampens responses to bacterial infection.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197151</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>CD39 is upregulated during activation of mouse and human T cells and attenuates the immune response to &amp;lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><author><name>Friederike Raczkowski</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197151</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Friederike Raczkowski, Anne Rissiek, Isabell Ricklefs, Kirsten Heiss, Valéa Schumacher, Kira Wundenberg, Friedrich Haag, Friedrich Koch-Nolte, Eva Tolosa, Hans-Willi Mittrücker&lt;/p&gt;

That’s how it is in drug research, and how it is in science in general. The problems and questions we’re working on are bigger than any one nationality; we’re tackling these things as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s disquieting to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/584?rss=1&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. That article reports that the (quite nationalist) government in Hungary is causing trouble for universities there, specifically the Central European University, accusing it and some of its faculty members of being in the pay of opponents of the government. It’s especially sad to see the national science funding agency participate in such actions. Hungarian scientists were a profound influence on the 20th century; the country produced a run of mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and chemists that had colleagues at Los Alamos joking that they must be Martians in disguise. But they didn’t get to that point by trying to do only Pure Hungarian Research, because there’s no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than there is Pure American, Pure German, or Pure Chinese Research.A look at what Germany did to its own scientific establishment under the National Socialist government should be all that’s needed as an argument, but apparently not. These things are dangerous fantasies, because talent comes from everywhere (and it often doesn’t conform to any given government’s ideology, either). I have a strong feeling that the current Hungarian government would be denouncing John von Neumann as a secret agent of George Soros were he or his like alive today. And they’re doing their best to make sure that the country never produces another such figure, which is a loss for the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/china-to-roll-back-regulations-for-traditional-medicine-despite-safety-concerns-1.23038&quot;&gt;Here’s another example&lt;/a&gt; of nationalism at work, this time in drug research. The Chinese government is apparently planning to drop requirements for safety and efficacy testing of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapies. Xi Jinping himself is a big advocate, and what more do you need? Students who want to become TCM practitioners no longer need to pass the national medical exam to open their practices. Not only are these preparations getting easy regulatory treatment – the government is making it harder and harder for anyone to express any contrary opinions about them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With strong government support for the alternative medicines industry, Chinese censors have been quick to remove posts from the Internet that question its efficacy. On 23 October, an article on a medical news site that called for closer attention to the risks of aristolochic acid was removed from social media site WeChat. The story had been viewed more than 700,000 times in three days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debate over TCMs has been silenced before in China. Last year, a Beijing think tank — the Development Research Center of the State Council — proposed banning the practice of extracting Asiatic black bear bile, another common ingredient in TCMs. The think tank’s report questioned the remedy’s efficacy and suggested using synthetic alternatives. It was removed from the think tank’s website after the Chinese Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which supports the development of TCM, called it biased and demanded an apology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04886-8&quot;&gt;go to jail&lt;/a&gt; for criticizing this stuff. Now, I think the way that the US regulates (or doesn’t regulate) “dietary supplements” &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/11/04/the_herbal_supplement_industry_is_not_a_very_funny_joke&quot;&gt;is a disgrace&lt;/a&gt;, but this is insanely worse. China has a great many excellent scientists, in a great many fields, and in drug research in particular they’re working on joining the short list of countries who have their own research-based drug industry that can produce new therapies to help patients around the world. But this effort will not be aided by making it easier for the black bear bile industry. I leave aside for another time discussion of how some of these “remedies” are driving animals around the world to extinction, but that’s just another argument for actually seeing if any of these things work (or even cause actual harm instead), and &lt;em&gt;taking them off the market&lt;/em&gt; if they don’t. But the Chinese government has made the cynical calculation that promoting this stuff will pay off politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? There’s a connection between these two examples. Guess what the Hungarian government is interested in promoting? Traditional Chinese medicine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Government spokespeople declined to answer specific questions about CEU, but did address another flash point: the country’s growing embrace of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). On 16 April, Hungary’s University of Szeged signed an agreement with the Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine in Xianyang, China, to bring TCM researchers, medical experts, and lecturers to teach in the region. The University of Pécs in Hungary has had a similar arrangement since 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year, the Hungarian government also announced plans to allocate about €4.5 million ($5.3 million) to build a new institute with a whole floor dedicated to TCM at Semmelweis University, one of the most prestigious medical schools in Hungary. The government says it wants to bridge the gap between Western medicine and Eastern alternatives to improve Hungarian health care, and also strengthen the economic, political, and cultural ties between Hungary and China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would guess that the most important word in that last sentence is “economic”. It’s pretty strange to see the Hungarian government deciding that the honor of Hungary has to be protected by embracing Chinese herbal remedies, but I’m sure that there are plenty of idiotic speeches laying this connection out in soul-eroding detail. No, this sort of thing is bad news. The reason science works is that we ask questions, investigate them to the best of our abilities, and build on the results that we get &lt;em&gt;whether we like them or not&lt;/em&gt;. Wishful thinking doesn’t work so well. The physical world does what it does independent of anyone’s political agenda or nationalist sloganeering, and pretending otherwise is shameful and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526042727000</published><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13530</link><fingerprint>9bff70fd</fingerprint><title>Nationalist Medicine?

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The standard clinical approach to non-occupational HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) focuses on biomedical aspects of the intervention, but may overlook co-occurring or ‘syndemic’ psychosocial problems that reinforce future vulnerability to HIV. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence of syndemic health problems in a cohort of Ontario nPEP patients, and explored the relationship between syndemic burden and HIV risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between 07/2013-08/2016, we distributed a self-administered questionnaire to patients presenting to three clinics in Toronto and Ottawa seeking nPEP for sexual HIV exposures. We used validated screening tools to estimate the prevalence of depression (CES-D score ≥16), harmful alcohol use (AUDIT ≥8), problematic drug use (DUDIT ≥6 men/≥2 women), and sexual compulsivity (SCS ≥24) among men who have sex with men (MSM) respondents. In exploratory analyses, we examined the relationships between syndemic conditions using univariable logistic regression models, and the relationship between syndemic count (total number of syndemic conditions per participant) and HIV risk, as estimated by the HIRI-MSM score, using linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The 186 MSM included in the analysis had median age 31 (IQR = 26–36), including 87.6% having a college/undergraduate degree or higher. Overall, 53.8% screened positive for depression, 34.4% for harmful alcohol use, 30.1% for problematic drug use, and 16.1% for sexual compulsivity. Most participants (74.2%) had at least one syndemic condition and 46.8% had more than one. Exploratory analyses suggested positive associations between depression and harmful alcohol use (OR = 2.11, 95%CI = 1.13, 3.94) and between harmful alcohol use and problematic drug use (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 0.65, 2.29). Syndemic count was associated with increased HIRI-MSM risk scores in univariable (2.2, 95%CI = 1.0, 3.3 per syndemic condition) and multivariable (2.1, 95%CI = 0.6, 3.6) linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of syndemic conditions in MSM seeking nPEP for sexual exposure is alarmingly high, and is associated with underlying HIV risk.

Mitotane is the reference drug for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and the metabolic activation of the drug is considered as essential for its activity. The aim of this study was to assess the role of CYP11B1 on mitotane action and metabolism in H295R ACC cells to understand whether this enzyme may influence mitotane action. The simultaneous incubation with mitotane and metyrapone, an adrenolytic molecule targeting 11-beta-hydroxylase, did not influence mitotane-mediated cytotoxic effect and metabolism in H295R ACC cells. CYP11B1 silencing confirmed the lack of a significant metyrapone effect on mitotane action. The present findings do not support the view that CYP11B1 catalyzes a crucial step in the metabolic activation of mitotane and that CYP11B1 confers the adrenal specificity to mitotane.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196931</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>CYP11B1 has no role in mitotane action and metabolism in adrenocortical carcinoma cells</title><author><name>Antonina Germano</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196931</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antonina Germano, Laura Saba, Silvia De Francia, Ida Rapa, Paola Perotti, Alfredo Berruti, Marco Volante, Massimo Terzolo&lt;/p&gt;

Interleukin 17 (IL-17)–producing γδ T cells (γδ17 T cells) have been recently found to promote tumor growth and metastasis formation. How such γδ17 T-cell responses may be regulated in the tumor microenvironment remains, however, largely unknown. Here, we report that tumor-associated neutrophils can display an overt antitumor role by strongly suppressing γδ17 T cells. Tumor-associated neutrophils inhibited the proliferation of murine CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells via induction of oxidative stress, thereby preventing them from constituting the major source of pro-tumoral IL-17 in the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we found that low expression of the antioxidant glutathione in CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells renders them particularly susceptible to neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistently, superoxide deficiency, or the administration of a glutathione precursor, rescued CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T-cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, human Vδ1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ T cells, which contain most γδ17 T cells found in cancer patients, also displayed low glutathione levels and were potently inhibited by ROS. This work thus identifies an unanticipated, immunosuppressive yet antitumoral, neutrophil/ROS/γδ17 T-cell axis in the tumor microenvironment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dvsUoCba6KA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004990</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Mensurado, Margarida Rei, Telma Lança, Marianna Ioannou, Natacha Gonçalves-Sousa, Hiroshi Kubo, Marie Malissen, Venizelos Papayannopoulos, Karine Serre, Bruno Silva-Santos&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The CES-D is a widely used depression screening instrument. While numerous studies have analysed its psychometric properties using exploratory and various kinds of confirmatory factor analyses, only few studies used Rasch models and none a multidimensional one.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The present study applies a multidimensional Rasch model using a sample of 518 respondents representative for the Austrian general population aged 18 to 65. A one-dimensional model, a four-dimensional model reflecting the subscale structure suggested by [1], and a four-dimensional model with the background variables gender and age were applied.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;While the one-dimensional model showed relatively good fit, the four-dimensional model fitted much better. EAP reliability indices were generally satisfying and the latent correlations varied between 0.31 and 0.88. In the analysis involving background variables, we found a limited effect of the participants’ gender. DIF effects were found unveiling some peculiarities. The two-items subscale Interpersonal Difficulties showed severe weaknesses and the Positive Affect subscale with the reversed item wordings also showed unexpected results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While a one-dimensional over-all score might still contain helpful information, the differentiation according to the latent dimension is strongly preferable.

Identification of cancer driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity, many driver mutations occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from passenger mutations. Here, we show that a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach, named rDriver can achieve enhanced prediction accuracy by identifying mutations that not only have high functional impact scores but also are associated with systemic variation in gene expression levels. In examining 3,080 tumor samples from 8 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, rDriver predicted 1,389 driver mutations. Compared with existing tools, rDriver identified more low frequency mutations associated with lineage specific functional properties, timing of occurrence and patient survival. Evaluation of rDriver predictions using engineered cell-line models resulted in a positive predictive value of 0.94 in &lt;i&gt;PIK3CA&lt;/i&gt; genes. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multi-omic data in predicting cancer driver mutations and provides a statistically rigorous solution for cancer target discovery and development.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196939</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Cancer driver mutation prediction through Bayesian integration of multi-omic data</title><author><name>Zixing Wang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196939</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zixing Wang, Kwok-Shing Ng, Tenghui Chen, Tae-Beom Kim, Fang Wang, Kenna Shaw, Kenneth L.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Objective was to examine the temporal variation of HIV sero-discordancy in select representative countries (Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Niger, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe) in sub-Saharan Africa at different HIV epidemic scales. A sero-discordant couple is defined as a stable couple (SC) in which one partner is HIV-positive while the other is HIV-negative.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A deterministic compartmental mathematical model was constructed to describe HIV transmission dynamics. The model was pair-based, that is explicitly modeling formation of SCs and infection dynamics in both SCs and in single individuals. The model accommodated for different forms of infection statuses in SCs. Using population-based nationally-representative epidemiologic and demographic input data, historical (1980–2014) and future (2015–2030) trends of sero-discordancy and other demographic and epidemiologic indicators were projected throughout HIV epidemic phases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;As the epidemics emerged, about 90% of SCs affected by HIV were sero-discordant. This proportion declined to 45%-88% at epidemic peak and stabilized as the epidemics started their natural decline. The largest reductions in sero-discordancy were in high HIV-prevalence countries. As the epidemics further declined with antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up, the proportion of sero-discordant couples among HIV-affected couples was projected to increase to 70%-92% by 2030. The proportion of sero-discordant couples among all SCs increased as the epidemics emerged and evolved, then peaked at 2%-20% as the epidemics peaked, and then declined as the epidemics declined to reach 0.3%-16% by 2030.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sero-discordancy patterns varied with the evolution of the epidemics, and were affected by both epidemic phase and scale. The largest variations were found in high HIV-prevalence countries. The fraction of stable couples that are sero-discordant, as opposed to being sero-concordant positive, was projected to increase with ART scale-up and further HIV incidence decline over the coming two decades. These findings inform strategic planning and resource allocation for interventions among sero-discordant couples.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196613</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Temporal evolution of HIV sero-discordancy patterns among stable couples in sub-Saharan Africa</title><author><name>Susanne F.

This dataset provides 11 million SNP profiles for individuals with defined ethnicities and family relationships spanning eight generations with admixture for a panel with 39,108 SNPs.</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1526367600000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321190v1?rss=1</link><fingerprint>e96b5f4a</fingerprint><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636477c97a:3885c6c:3dd877af</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25733-w</href></item></canonical><crawled>1525904431869</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Reply to ‘Climate of doubt: a re-evaluation of Büntgen and Di Cosmo’s environmental hypothesis for the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary, 1242 CE’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Reply to ‘Climate of doubt: a re-evaluation of Büntgen and Di Cosmo’s environmental hypothesis for the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary, 1242 CE’, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25733-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25733-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Reply to ‘Climate of doubt: a re-evaluation of Büntgen and Di Cosmo’s environmental hypothesis for the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary, 1242 CE’&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/v2c5kFfo660&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25733-w</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Publisher Correction: Reply to ‘Climate of doubt: a re-evaluation of Büntgen and Di Cosmo’s environmental hypothesis for the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary, 1242 CE’</title><author><name>Ulf Büntgen</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/v2c5kFfo660/s41598-018-25733-w</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Reply to ‘Climate of doubt: a re-evaluation of Büntgen and Di Cosmo’s environmental hypothesis for the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary, 1242 CE’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Reply to ‘Climate of doubt: a re-evaluation of Büntgen and Di Cosmo’s environmental hypothesis for the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary, 1242 CE’, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25733-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25733-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Reply to ‘Climate of doubt: a re-evaluation of Büntgen and Di Cosmo’s environmental hypothesis for the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary, 1242 CE’&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/v2c5kFfo660&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><published>1525935600000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25733-w</link><fingerprint>928f23bd</fingerprint><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16346fddafd:eb5c63:93d646dc</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00151</href></item></canonical><crawled>1526472658729</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.8b00151/20180516/images/medium/ci-2018-001517_0013.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00151&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The biological impetus for gene dosage and allele specificity of mammalian imprinted genes is not fully understood. To address this, we generated and analyzed four sets of mice from a single breeding scheme with varying allelic expression and gene dosage of the &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; domain. The mutants with abrogation of the two paternally expressed genes, &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt;, showed a significant decrease in growth rates for both males and females, while the mutants with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; resulted in an increased growth rate of female mice only. The mutant cohort with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; tended to have greater numbers of pups compared to the other genotypes. The mutants with switched active alleles displayed overall similar phenotypes to the wild type, but did show some differences in gene expression, suggesting potential non-redundant roles contributed by the maternal and paternal alleles. Overall, this study demonstrates a novel &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; approach to investigate the allele and dosage specificity of mammalian imprinted domains.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197069</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Allele and dosage specificity of the &amp;lt;i&gt;Peg3&amp;lt;/i&gt; imprinted domain</title><author><name>Corey L.
