Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß. Our findings define a novel role for AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes via its modulation of Wnt/ß-catenin and NF-κB signaling activities and the cross-talk between these two signaling pathways.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197690</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543e:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takeshi Minashima, Thorsten Kirsch&lt;/p&gt;

Infection experiments are critical for understanding wildlife disease dynamics. Although infection experiments are typically designed to reduce complexity, disease outcomes still result from complex interactions between host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Cryptic variation across factors can lead to decreased repeatability of infection experiments within and between research groups and hinder research progress. Furthermore, studies with unexpected results are often relegated to the “file drawer” and potential insights gained from these experimental outcomes are lost. Here, we report unexpected results from an infection experiment studying the response of two differentially-susceptible but related frogs (American Bullfrog &lt;i&gt;Rana catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; and the Mountain yellow-legged frog &lt;i&gt;Rana muscosa&lt;/i&gt;) to the amphibian-killing chytrid fungus (&lt;i&gt;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&lt;/i&gt;, Bd). Despite well-documented differences in susceptibility between species, we found no evidence for antibody-mediated immune response and no Bd-related mortality in either species. Additionally, during the study, the sham-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; control group became unexpectedly Bd-positive. We used a custom genotyping assay to demonstrate that the aberrantly-infected &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; carried a Bd genotype distinct from the inoculation genotype. Thus &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; individuals were acquired with low-intensity infections that could not be detected with qPCR. In the Bd-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; treatment group, the inoculated genotype appeared to out-compete the cryptic infection. Thus, our results provide insight into Bd coinfection dynamics, a phenomenon that is increasingly relevant as different pathogen strains are moved around the globe. Our experiment highlights how unexpected experimental outcomes can serve as both cautionary tales and opportunities to explore unanswered research questions. We use our results as a case study to highlight common sources of anomalous results for infection experiments. We argue that understanding these factors will aid researchers in the design, execution, and interpretation of experiments to understand wildlife disease processes.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196851</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed3:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Allison Q.

State-of-the-art light-sheet and confocal microscopes allow recording of entire embryos in 3D and over time (3D+t) for many hours. Fluorescently labeled structures can be segmented and tracked automatically in these terabyte-scale 3D+t images, resulting in thousands of cell migration trajectories that provide detailed insights to large-scale tissue reorganization at the cellular level. Here we present EmbryoMiner, a new interactive open-source framework suitable for in-depth analyses and comparisons of entire embryos, including an extensive set of trajectory features. Starting at the whole-embryo level, the framework can be used to iteratively focus on a region of interest within the embryo, to investigate and test specific trajectory-based hypotheses and to extract quantitative features from the isolated trajectories. Thus, the new framework provides a valuable new way to quantitatively compare corresponding anatomical regions in different embryos that were manually selected based on biological prior knowledge. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 3D+t light-sheet microscopy images of zebrafish embryos, showcasing potential user applications that can be performed using the new framework.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fPwmNSZz3xw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162df187f34:50ab7:a077e55f</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Schott, Manuel Traub, Cornelia Schlagenhauf, Masanari Takamiya, Thomas Antritter, Andreas Bartschat, Katharina Löffler, Denis Blessing, Jens C.

Background &lt;p&gt;A major feature of acute lung injury (ALI) is excessive inflammation in the lung. Vitexin is an active component from medicinal plants which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in the pathophysiological processes in ALI. In the current study, we investigate the effect and potential mechanisms of Vitexin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;ALI was induced by LPS intratracheal instillation in C57BL/6 wild-type mice and Nrf2 gene knocked down (Nrf2-/-) mice. One hour before LPS challenge, Vitexin or vehicle intraperitoneal injection was performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues were examined for lung inflammation and injury at 24 h after LPS challenge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our animal study’s results showed that LPS-induced recruitment of neutrophils and elevation of proinflammatory cytokine levels were attenuated by Vitexin treatment. Vitexin decreased lung edema and alveolar protein content. Moreover, Vitexin activated nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and increased the activity of its target gene heme oxygenase (HO)-1. The LPS-induced reactive oxygen species were inhibited by Vitexin. In addition, the activation of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat PYD-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was suppressed by Vitexin.

Background &lt;p&gt;A major feature of acute lung injury (ALI) is excessive inflammation in the lung. Vitexin is an active component from medicinal plants which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in the pathophysiological processes in ALI. In the current study, we investigate the effect and potential mechanisms of Vitexin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;ALI was induced by LPS intratracheal instillation in C57BL/6 wild-type mice and Nrf2 gene knocked down (Nrf2-/-) mice. One hour before LPS challenge, Vitexin or vehicle intraperitoneal injection was performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues were examined for lung inflammation and injury at 24 h after LPS challenge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our animal study’s results showed that LPS-induced recruitment of neutrophils and elevation of proinflammatory cytokine levels were attenuated by Vitexin treatment. Vitexin decreased lung edema and alveolar protein content. Moreover, Vitexin activated nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and increased the activity of its target gene heme oxygenase (HO)-1. The LPS-induced reactive oxygen species were inhibited by Vitexin. In addition, the activation of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat PYD-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was suppressed by Vitexin. However, these effects of Vitexin were abolished in the Nrf2-/- mice. Our cell studies showed that Vitexin enhanced the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 activity. Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-1β productions were reduced in Vitexin-treated cells. However, knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA in RAW cells reversed the benefit of Vitexin.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Vitexin suppresses LPS-induced ALI by controlling Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/707?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/707?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/707.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Ager, J.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Active recovery is often used by athletes after strenuous exercise or competition but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We observed a time × group interaction effect for VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; (p = 0.013). Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026). No significant effects were observed for all other variables.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Active recovery increased aspects of central, rather than muscle recovery. However, no effect on MVC was seen, implying that even if active recovery speeds up CNS recovery, without affecting the recovery of muscle contractile properties, this doesn´t translate into increases in overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197339</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219f:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Louis-Solal Giboin, Ehsan Amiri, Raphael Bertschinger, Markus Gruber&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction and objectives &lt;p&gt;Progressive ataxic gait is a common symptom in individuals with Familial Dysautonomia (FD). At least 50% of adults with FD require assistance with walking. Our aims were to describe the medical condition of individuals with FD (ii) compare their gait characteristics to healthy individuals, and (iii) assess correlations between gait measures, presence of unstable gait pattern and frequency of falls.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Twelve subjects with FD (7 males, age 25.3±10.6 years) and 16 healthy participants (6 males, age 35.9±11.9 years) were recruited. Gait kinematics, gait symmetry, dynamic muscle activity, and foot deep vibration sensation were recorded.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ataxic gait degrees were: severe (6 out of 12), moderate (4 out of 12) and low (2 out of 12). The number of falls correlated with base width asymmetry. Crouch gait was noted in 3 out of 12 of the subjects.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In-depth quantitative gait analysis of individuals with FD revealed ataxic gait. The ataxic pattern might be a result of combined neurological deficiencies and osseous deformities. Increasing the base of support of patients with FD might increase the symmetry of the base width during gait and decrease the number of falls.

This study describes differences in species richness and composition of the assemblages of galling insects and their host plants at different spatial scales. Sampling was conducted along altitudinal gradients composed of &lt;i&gt;campos rupestres&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;campos de altitude&lt;/i&gt; of two mountain complexes in southeastern Brazil: Espinhaço Range and Mantiqueira Range. The following hypotheses were tested: i) local and regional richness of host plants and galling insects are positively correlated; ii) beta diversity is the most important component of regional diversity of host plants and galling insects; and iii) Turnover is the main mechanism driving beta diversity of both host plants and galling insects. Local richness of galling insects and host plants increased with increasing regional richness of species, suggesting a pattern of unsaturated communities. The additive partition of regional richness (γ) into local and beta components shows that local richnesses (α) of species of galling insects and host plants are low relative to regional richness; the beta (β) component incorporates most of the regional richness. The multi-scale analysis of additive partitioning showed similar patterns for galling insects and host plants with the local component (α) incorporated a small part of regional richness. Beta diversity of galling insects and host plants were mainly the result of turnover, with little contribution from nesting.

This study describes differences in species richness and composition of the assemblages of galling insects and their host plants at different spatial scales. Sampling was conducted along altitudinal gradients composed of &lt;i&gt;campos rupestres&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;campos de altitude&lt;/i&gt; of two mountain complexes in southeastern Brazil: Espinhaço Range and Mantiqueira Range. The following hypotheses were tested: i) local and regional richness of host plants and galling insects are positively correlated; ii) beta diversity is the most important component of regional diversity of host plants and galling insects; and iii) Turnover is the main mechanism driving beta diversity of both host plants and galling insects. Local richness of galling insects and host plants increased with increasing regional richness of species, suggesting a pattern of unsaturated communities. The additive partition of regional richness (γ) into local and beta components shows that local richnesses (α) of species of galling insects and host plants are low relative to regional richness; the beta (β) component incorporates most of the regional richness. The multi-scale analysis of additive partitioning showed similar patterns for galling insects and host plants with the local component (α) incorporated a small part of regional richness. Beta diversity of galling insects and host plants were mainly the result of turnover, with little contribution from nesting. Although the species composition of galling insects and host plant species varied among sample sites, mountains and even mountain ranges, local richness remained relatively low. In this way, the addition of local habitats with different landscapes substantially affects regional richness. Each mountain contributes fundamentally to the composition of regional diversity of galling insects and host plants, and so the design of future conservation strategies should incorporate multiple scales.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13547</link><alternate><item><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/17/chiral-separations-with-magnets-no-for-real</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><published>1526570994000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Chiral Separations With Magnets.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Quick background for those not in the field: a great many three-dimensional molecules can exist in right-handed and left-handed mirror-image forms (enantiomers), exactly like pairs of shoes. They have the property of “chirality”. When this happens with drug compounds, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/28/right-hand-left-hand-either-hand&quot;&gt;generally the case&lt;/a&gt; that the two have different activities, because proteins in the body are chiral, too. Where that handedness comes from is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/12/15/chirality-from-chemical-supply-houses-to-life-as-we-know-it&quot;&gt;rather deep question&lt;/a&gt;. Separating enantiomers is generally done by using another chiral substance (making derivatives or salts of the parent compound or passing across a purification column loaded with some chiral solid phase].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of proposals in this vein, although it’s a minefield of subtlety (and of irreproducible experiments). But there are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/05/24/a_new_way_to_determine_chirality&quot;&gt;electromagnetic effects&lt;/a&gt; that are both theoretically feasible and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/05/enantioselectivity-with-microwaves&quot;&gt;experimentally real&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/05/09/science.aar4265.full&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt; seems to be another one. The paper starts off, I should note, with a brief history on the intersection of chirality and magnetism, a topic that involved heavy hitters like Pasteur, Lord Kelvin, and Pierre Curie in its early days. During my own career, I well recall reports of chiral induction in magnetic fields that had to be retracted to much embarrassment, so it does take some bravery to venture into this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors, a multicenter team from Israel, the US, Germany, and Poland, are taking advantage of a phenomenon called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). Simply put – and I’m not going to be able to put it at a much higher level – electron movement through molecules is affected by their chirality. And that means that charge distribution in two enantiomers has different spin polarization in each one. That led the group to wonder about the interaction of chiral molecules with perpendicularly-magnetized surfaces, which have been the subject of much research in thin-film “spintronic” applications. In theory, one enantiomer could be attracted to such a surface much more than the other, depending on the direction of the magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just what happens. They picked a test helical polyalanine peptide and a gold-layered ferromagnet film (the gold is to protect it from oxidation, and the behavior of the exact peptide on gold layers had already been studied in other contexts). Attaching nanoparticles to the peptide (for visualization) and exposing these to the surface showed (by electron microscopy) a dramatic difference based on the direction of the perpendicular magnetic field. In one direction, the particles stick, and in the other they don’t. If the magnetization is in-plane (instead of perpendicular), there’s no difference, and there’s no difference if you’re applying an external magnetic field instead. It has to be a field associated with the thin layer, and it has to be in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also prepared a 50/50 mix of D- and L-peptides, and this (as it should) shows no circular dichroism. But after multiple exposures to fresh magnetic surfaces, the solution was clearly enriched in one enantiomer, and began to show circular dichroism as expected, increasing with the number of exposures. They then set this up as a flow experiment, and the results were unmistakeable: flowing an an enantiomeric mixture of two peptides down an unmagnetized column gave the same racemic mixture out the other end. But when the surface was magnetized “perpendicular down”, they got a strong CD spectrum from the eluent, and when it was magnetized “perpendicular up”, they got the mirror-image CD spectrum: the other enantiomer. The D enantiomers interact with the down-magnetized surfaces and the L enantiomers with the up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just peptides, either. A DNA oligomer was shown to bind to one magnetization and not the other, and the effect was reproduced with the single amino acid cysteine. In each case the kinetics are different for different sorts of molecules, different at various concentrations, and different between the enantiomers. The system thus has to be tuned for the best separation, but the effect is real across all of them. And that immediately suggests a whole new kind of chromatography:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The enantioselective interaction of chiral molecules with a magnetic substrate, presented in this article, provides a potentially generic chromatographic method for enantioseparation, which does not require a specific separating column. Because the observed effect depends on the electrical polarizability of the system (that is accompanied by spin polarization) and because this polarization depends on the global structure of the chiral molecule, the method described here may also allow the separation of chiral molecules from a mixture of molecules, either chiral or achiral. In addition, this technique could potentially be applied for separating chiral molecules based on their secondary structure and/or for separating two secondary structures of the same chiral molecule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would appear that a completely new analytical method has been invented, and I very much look forward to seeing what can be made out of it. We’re going to have to learn to think about chiral separations in a completely different way than we’re used to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is pathologically characterized by the massive influx of immune cells into the central nervous system. This contributes to demyelination and axonal damage which causes symptoms such as motor and cognitive dysfunctions. The migration of leukocytes from the blood vessel is orchestrated by a multitude of factors whose determination is essential in reducing cellular influx in MS patients and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model. The here studied enzyme tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) is present intracellularly, on the cell surface and extracellularly. There it contributes to cellular adhesion and migration via its transamidation activity and possibly by facilitating cellular interaction with the extracellular matrix. Previous data from our group showed reduced motor symptoms and cellular infiltration after using a pharmacological TG2 transamidation activity inhibitor in a rat EAE model. However, it remained elusive if the cross-linking activity of the enzyme resulted in the observed effects. To follow-up, we now characterized two new small molecule TG2 activity inhibitors, BJJF078 and ERW1041E. Both compounds are potent inhibitor of recombinant human and mouse Transglutaminase enzyme activity, mainly TG2 and the close related enzyme TG1. In addition they did not affect the binding of TG2 to the extracellular matrix substrate fibronectin, a process via which TG2 promotes cellular adhesion and migration. We found, that ERW1041E but not BJJF078 resulted in reduced EAE disease motor-symptoms while neither caused apparent changes in pathology (cellular influx), Transglutaminase activity or expression of inflammation related markers in the spinal cord, compared to vehicle treated controls. Although we cannot exclude issues on bioavailability and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; efficacy of the used compounds, we hypothesize that extracellular TG1/TG2 activity is of greater importance than (intra-)cellular activity in mouse EAE pathology.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196433</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb7:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Navina L.

Proneural genes are among the most early-acting genes in nervous system development, instructing blast cells to commit to a neuronal fate. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Atonal and Achaete-Scute complex (AS-C) genes, as well as their vertebrate orthologs, are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with such proneural activity. We show here that a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; AS-C homolog, &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt;, functions in a fundamentally different manner. In the embryonic, larval, and adult nervous systems, &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is expressed exclusively in a single nociceptive neuron class, ADL, and its expression in ADL is maintained via transcriptional autoregulation throughout the life of the animal. However, in &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; null mutants, the ADL neuron is generated and still appears neuronal in overall morphology and expression of panneuronal and pansensory features. Rather than acting as a proneural gene, we find that &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is required for the ADL neuron to function properly, to adopt its correct morphology, to express its unusually large repertoire of olfactory receptor–encoding genes, and to express other known features of terminal ADL identity, including neurotransmitter phenotype, neuropeptides, ion channels, and electrical synapse proteins. &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is sufficient to induce ADL identity features upon ectopic expression in other neuron types. The expression of ADL terminal identity features is directly controlled by HLH-4 via a phylogenetically conserved E-box motif, which, through bioinformatic analysis, we find to constitute a predictive feature of ADL-expressed terminal identity markers. The lineage that produces the ADL neuron was previously shown to require the conventional, transient proneural activity of another AS-C homolog, &lt;i&gt;hlh-14&lt;/i&gt;, demonstrating sequential activities of distinct AS-C-type bHLH genes in neuronal specification. Taken together, we have defined here an unconventional function of an AS-C-type bHLH gene as a terminal selector of neuronal identity and we speculate that such function could be reflective of an ancestral function of an “ur-” bHLH gene.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kaDsHczXIbg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162df0925ef:4f0a0:a077e55f</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Neda Masoudi, Saeed Tavazoie, Lori Glenwinkel, Leesun Ryu, Kyuhyung Kim, Oliver Hobert&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the rapid worldwide expansion of parks with outdoor fitness equipment (OFE), no objective data regarding the intensity of activity associated with using OFE are available. Hence, this study quantified the energy expenditure and intensity of physical activity by examining four outdoor fitness devices widely used by older adults and provides objective evidence-based intensity references for the Compendium of Physical Activities. Sixteen older adults (mean age: 70.7 ± 5.6 yr) equipped with a portable metabolic system for measuring energy expenditure and activity intensity completed tasks while walking or using four types of OFE. Descriptive statistics and repeated-measures ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc test were employed. The energy expenditure and activity intensity for using an air walker at tempos of 80, 100, and 120 bpm were 50.78 ± 14.76 (2.81 ± 0.85), 59.62 ± 14.23 (3.26 ± 0.82), and 65.62 ± 18.27 (3.55 ± 1.02) cal/kg/min (METs), respectively. The induced energy and intensity output values for a ski machine were 54.00 ± 14.31 (3.02 ± 0.87), 68.87 ± 22.74 (3.82 ± 1.35), and 74.55 ± 23.39 (4.05 ± 1.35) cal/kg/min (METs), at 80, 100, and 120 bpm, respectively. The energy output for a waist twister at 60 bpm was 38.43 ± 20.16 cal/kg/min (2.05 ± 1.15 METs), and that for a double arm stretch at 80 bpm was 31.05 ± 12.58 cal/kg/min (1.63 ± 0.70 METs). These findings indicate that activity on the ski machine and air walker could be considered to have moderate intensity, whereas the intensity of activity on the waist twister and double arm stretch was significantly lower than that for walking at either 3.2 km/h or 4 km/h and could be considered only light intensity. The MET values for the OFE were lower than those for similar indoor fitness equipment. The results of this study provide crucial implications for public health practices concerning the development of active living environments.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196507</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4d:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hsueh-wen Chow, Chia-Hua Ho&lt;/p&gt;

Electroporation of zygotes represents a rapid alternative to the elaborate pronuclear injection procedure for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mice. However, current protocols for electroporation either require the investment in specialized electroporators or corrosive pre-treatment of zygotes which compromises embryo viability. Here, we describe an easily adaptable approach for the introduction of specific mutations in C57BL/6 mice by electroporation of intact zygotes using a common electroporator with synthetic CRISPR/Cas9 components and minimal technical requirement. Direct comparison to conventional pronuclear injection demonstrates significantly reduced physical damage and thus improved embryo development with successful genome editing in up to 100% of living offspring. Hence, our novel approach for Easy Electroporation of Zygotes (EEZy) allows highly efficient generation of CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic mice while reducing the numbers of animals required.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196891</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3ae9:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Simon E.

Many patients previously using darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) (800/100mg) have switched to darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/C) (800/150 mg) either as part of triple therapy (ART) or as monotherapy with DRV (mDRV). The latter approach continues to be used in some countries for patients receiving long-term treatment. However, to date, the behaviour of DRV/C in the seminal compartment has not been analysed. This study explores how the combination behaves in monotherapy, with respect to the control of viral load and seminal quality. To this end, we studied 20 patients who were treated with mDRV/C after previous treatment with mDRV/r for at least 24 weeks. A viral load control in seminal plasma similar to that published in the literature was observed after 24 weeks of treatment with mDRV/C (viral load positivity in 20% of patients). Similarly, semen quality was confirmed (70% normozoospermic) in patients treated with this formulation, as has previously been reported for ART and mDRV/r. The DRV levels measured in seminal plasma were above EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, regardless of whether the seminal viral load was positive or negative. We conclude that this mDRV/C co-formulation behaves like mDRV/r in seminal plasma in terms of viral load control and semen quality.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196257</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa4:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miguel A.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib) are indicated as first-line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Erlotinib is also used in second and third-line therapy for patients whose tumors have wild type EGFR but to date there are no validated biomarkers useful to identify which patients may benefit from this treatment. The expression level of four miRNAs: miR-133b, -146a, -7 and -21 which target EGFR was investigated by real-time PCR in tumor specimens from NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib administered as the second or third line. We found that miR-133b expression level better discriminated responder from non-responder patients to erlotinib. Higher levels of miR-133b in NSCLCs were associated with longer progression-free survival time of patients. Functional analyses on miR-133b through transfection of a miR-133b mimic in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines indicated that increasing miR-133b expression level led to a decreased cell growth and altered morphology but did not affect sensitivity to erlotinib.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib) are indicated as first-line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Erlotinib is also used in second and third-line therapy for patients whose tumors have wild type EGFR but to date there are no validated biomarkers useful to identify which patients may benefit from this treatment. The expression level of four miRNAs: miR-133b, -146a, -7 and -21 which target EGFR was investigated by real-time PCR in tumor specimens from NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib administered as the second or third line. We found that miR-133b expression level better discriminated responder from non-responder patients to erlotinib. Higher levels of miR-133b in NSCLCs were associated with longer progression-free survival time of patients. Functional analyses on miR-133b through transfection of a miR-133b mimic in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines indicated that increasing miR-133b expression level led to a decreased cell growth and altered morphology but did not affect sensitivity to erlotinib. The detection of miR-133b expression levels in tumors help in the identification of NSCLC patients with a better prognosis and who are likely to benefit from second and third-line therapy with erlotinib.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/458?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/458?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/458.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Phillips, C.</name></author><published>1524764252000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>My second coming out</title><crawled>1524766155374</crawled><fingerprint>36cb228f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/458?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1630325226e:3dd912:fc1f8953</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>351</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196554</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196554</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Thona Lim</name></author><published>1525122000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Insectivorous bat reproduction and human cave visitation in Cambodia: A perfect conservation storm?</title><updated>1525122000000</updated><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><fingerprint>1aae5afd</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196554</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thona Lim, Julien Cappelle, Thavry Hoem, Neil Furey&lt;/p&gt;
Cave roosting bats represent an important component of Southeast Asian bat diversity and are vulnerable to human disturbance during critical reproductive periods (pregnancy, lactation and weaning). Because dramatic growth of cave tourism in recent decades has raised concerns about impacts on cave bats in the region, we assessed the reproductive phenology of two insectivorous species (&lt;i&gt;Hipposideros larvatus&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato and &lt;i&gt;Taphozous melanopogon&lt;/i&gt;) at three caves in Cambodia for 23 months in 2014–2016 and evaluated human visitation to these sites between 2007 and 2014. Despite the differing foraging strategies employed by the two taxa, the temporal consistency observed in proportions of pregnant, lactating and juvenile bats indicates that their major birth peaks coincide with the time of greatest cave visitation annually, particularly for domestic visitors and namely during the Cambodian new year in April. They also reflect rainfall patterns and correspond with the reproductive phenology of insectivorous cave bats in Vietnam. These findings were predictable because 1) insect biomass and thus food availability for insectivorous bats are optimal for ensuring survival of young following this period, and 2) the Khmer new year is the most significant month for religious ceremonies and thus domestic cave visitation nationally, due to the abundance of Buddhist shrines and temples in Cambodian caves. While the impact of visitor disturbance on bat population recruitment cannot be empirically assessed due to lack of historical data, it is nonetheless likely to have been considerable and raises a conservation concern. Further, because growing evidence suggests that insectivorous cave bats exhibit reproductive synchrony across continental Southeast Asia where countless cave shrines are heavily frequented during April in Theravada Buddhist countries (e.g., Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos), our results may have wider applicability in the region. We consequently advocate for increased emphasis on sustainable cave management practices in Cambodia and further investigations to determine whether our findings present a broader concern for cave bat conservation in Southeast Asia.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196554</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4f:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thona Lim, Julien Cappelle, Thavry Hoem, Neil Furey&lt;/p&gt;

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, almost exclusively female lung disease linked to inactivating mutations in &lt;i&gt;tuberous sclerosis complex 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TSC2)&lt;/i&gt;, a tumor suppressor gene that controls cell metabolic state and growth via regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) signaling. mTORC1 is frequently activated in human cancers and, although the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has a cytostatic effect, it is, in general, unable to elicit a robust curative effect or tumor regression. Using RNA-Seq, we identified (1) &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like Growth Factor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt;) as one of the genes with the highest fold-change difference between human &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-null and &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-expressing angiomyolipoma cells from a patient with LAM, and (2) the mouse &lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt; homolog &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt;, as a top-ranking gene according to fold change between &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We extended transcript-level findings to protein level, observing increased Igf2 protein expression and Igf2 secretion by &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. Increased Igf2 expression was not due to epigenetic imprinting, but was partially mediated through the Stat3 pathway and was completely insensitive to rapamycin treatment. An siRNA-mediated decrease of Igf2 resulted in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation, suggesting presence of an autocrine Igf2/Stat3 amplification cycle in &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. In human pulmonary LAM lesions and metastatic cell clusters, high levels of IGF2 were associated with mTORC1 activation. In addition, treatment of three primary IGF2-expressing LAM lung cell lines with rapamycin did not result in IGF2 level changes. Thus, targeting of IGF2 signaling may be of therapeutic value to LAM patients, particularly those who are unresponsive to rapamycin.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197105</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd2:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Blanca E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are biomarkers for several neoplastic diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a literature search, followed by experimental screening and validation in order to establish a miRNA panel in combination with the assessment of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and to evaluate its performance in HCC diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Expression of miRNAs was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 406 serum samples from 118 Vietnamese patients with hepatitis B (HBV)-related HCC, 69 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 100 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 119 healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three miRNAs (mir-21, mir-122, mir-192) were expressed differentially among the studied subgroups and positively correlated with AFP levels. The individual miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir192 or the triplex miRNA panel showed high diagnostic accuracy for HCC (HCC vs. CHB, AUC = 0.906; HCC vs. CHB+LC, AUC = 0.81; HCC vs. CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.854). When AFP levels were ≤20ng/ml, the triplex miRNA panel still was accurate in distinguishing HCC from the other conditions (CHB, AUC = 0.922; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.836; CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.862).

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To develop a simple dementia screening tool to assist primary care physicians in identifying patients with cognitive impairment among subjects with memory complaints or at a high risk for dementia.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The Brain Health Test (BHT) was developed by several experienced neurologists, psychiatrists, and clinical psychologists in the Taiwan Dementia Society. Validation of the BHT was conducted in the memory clinics of various levels of hospitals in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Participants &lt;p&gt;All dementia patients at the memory clinics who met the inclusion criteria of age greater or equal to 50 years were enrolled. Besides the BHT, the Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating were used to evaluate the cognition state of the patients and the severity of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The BHT includes two parts: a risk evaluation and a cognitive test (BHT-cog). Self or informants reports of memory decline or needing help from others to manage money or medications were significantly associated with cognitive impairment.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To develop a simple dementia screening tool to assist primary care physicians in identifying patients with cognitive impairment among subjects with memory complaints or at a high risk for dementia.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The Brain Health Test (BHT) was developed by several experienced neurologists, psychiatrists, and clinical psychologists in the Taiwan Dementia Society. Validation of the BHT was conducted in the memory clinics of various levels of hospitals in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Participants &lt;p&gt;All dementia patients at the memory clinics who met the inclusion criteria of age greater or equal to 50 years were enrolled. Besides the BHT, the Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating were used to evaluate the cognition state of the patients and the severity of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The BHT includes two parts: a risk evaluation and a cognitive test (BHT-cog). Self or informants reports of memory decline or needing help from others to manage money or medications were significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Among the risk factors evaluated in the BHT, a total risk score greater or equal to 8 was defined as a high risk for dementia. The total score for the finalized BHT-cog was 16. When the cutoff value for the BHT-cog was set to 10 for differentiating dementia and a normal mental state, the sensitivity was 91.5%, the specificity was 87.3%, the positive predictive value was 94.8%, and the negative predictive value was 80.1% The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between dementia and healthy subjects was 0.958 (95% CI = 0.941–0.975).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The BHT is a simple tool that may be useful in primary care settings to identify high-risk patients to target for cognitive screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/309138v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/26/309138</canonicalUrl><author><name>Ritchie, S.

Background &lt;p&gt;The present study is aimed to evaluate the physiochemical properties and cytotoxicity of mercury-based formulation for the development of anticancer therapeuticals.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The elemental and morphological features of the formulation were characterized by FE-SEM, XPS and EDS. The described formulation was evaluated for its cytotoxicity on Hek293 and MCF7 cell lines using MTT assay to study the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; effects. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; developmental toxicity was also studied on zebrafish embryos and the lethal concentration (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values were calculated as per the OECD regulations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The elemental and morphological characterizations confirmed the presence of mercuric compounds. The particles were spherical and stable with the size ranges between 20 and 80nm. Although the PK formulation contains mercurials it was very effective only to cancerous cells (MCF-7) and it is less toxic to normal cells (HEK 293). The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; assessment of developmental toxicity on zebrafish embryo confirmed the safer dosage of 100μg/ml. However, a higher dosage of 1mg/ml led to the malformation of embryos such as pericardial, tail and yolk sac edema.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The physiochemical characterization of PK formulation confirmed the presence of HgS. The results of both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that the formulation is less toxic. Although the test sample contains mercurials it was very effective against cancerous cells (MCF-7) and it is less toxic to normal cells (HEK 293).&lt;/p&gt; Future studies &lt;p&gt;Further studies on effectiveness of the formulation along with inflammatory response in mice models are to be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195800</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccb5:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kannan N, Shanmuga Sundar S, Balaji S, Arul Amuthan, Anil Kumar NV, Balasubramanian N&lt;/p&gt;

Multicellular spheroids generated through cellular self-assembly provide cytoarchitectural complexities of native tissue including three-dimensionality, extensive cell-cell contacts, and appropriate cell-extracellular matrix interactions. They are increasingly suggested as building blocks for larger engineered tissues to achieve shapes, organization, heterogeneity, and other biomimetic complexities. Application of these tissue culture platforms is of particular importance in cardiac research as the myocardium is comprised of distinct but intermingled cell types. Here, we generated scaffold-free 3D cardiac microtissue spheroids comprised of cardiac myocytes (CMs) and/or cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and used them as building blocks to form larger microtissues with different spatial distributions of CMs and CFs. Characterization of fusing homotypic and heterotypic spheroid pairs revealed an important influence of CFs on fusion kinetics, but most strikingly showed rapid fusion kinetics between heterotypic pairs consisting of one CF and one CM spheroid, indicating that CMs and CFs self-sort &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into the intermixed morphology found in the healthy myocardium. We then examined electrophysiological integration of fused homotypic and heterotypic microtissues by mapping action potential propagation. Heterocellular elongated microtissues which recapitulate the disproportionate CF spatial distribution seen in the infarcted myocardium showed that action potentials propagate through CF volumes albeit with significant delay. Complementary computational modeling revealed an important role of CF sodium currents and the spatial distribution of the CM-CF boundary in action potential conduction through CF volumes. Taken together, this study provides useful insights for the development of complex, heterocellular engineered 3D tissue constructs and their engraftment via tissue fusion and has implications for arrhythmogenesis in cardiac disease and repair.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196714</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a6b:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tae Yun Kim, Celinda M.

&lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; HP0377 is a thiol oxidoreductase, a member of the CcmG family involved in cytochrome biogenesis, as previously shown by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments. In this report, we document that HP0377 also acts &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in the cytochrome assembly process in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, where it complements the lack of ResA. However, unlike other characterized proteins in this family, HP0377 is a dithiol reductase and isomerase. We elucidated how the amino acid composition of its active site modulates its functionality. We demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-proline (P156) is involved in its interaction with the redox partner (CcdA), as a P156T HP0377 variant is inactive &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and is present in the oxidized form in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, we showed that engineering the HP0377 active motif by changing CSYC motif into CSYS or SSYC, clearly diminishes two activities (reduction and isomerization) of the protein. Whereas HP0377&lt;sub&gt;CSYA&lt;/sub&gt; is inactive in reduction as well as in isomerization, HP0377&lt;sub&gt;CSYS&lt;/sub&gt; retains reductive activity. Also, replacement of F95 by Q decreases its ability to regenerate scRNase and does not influence the reductive activity of HP0377&lt;sub&gt;CSYS&lt;/sub&gt; towards apocytochrome c. HP0377 is also distinguished from other CcmGs as it forms a 2:1 complex with apocytochrome c. Phylogenetic analyses showed that, although HP0377 is capable of complementing ResA in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, its thioredoxin domain has a different origin, presumably common to DsbC.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195358</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f4:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Magdalena Joanna Grzeszczuk, Aleksandra Bąk, Anna Marta Banaś, Paweł Urbanowicz, Stanislaw Dunin-Horkawicz, Artur Gieldon, Cezary Czaplewski, Adam Liwo, Elżbieta K.

Anemia commonly occurs in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The management of patients with anemia in CKD is challenging, due to its severity, frequent hypo-responsiveness to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) and common hemoglobin cycling. Nonlinear dose-response curves and long delays in the effect of treatment on red blood cell population size complicate predictions of hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in individual patients. A comprehensive physiology based mathematical model for erythropoiesis was adapted individually to 60 hemodialysis patients treated with ESAs by identifying physiologically meaningful key model parameters from temporal Hgb data. Crit-Line&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; III monitors provided non-invasive Hgb measurements for every hemodialysis treatment. We used Hgb data during a 150-day baseline period together to estimate a patient’s individual red blood cell lifespan, effects of the ESA on proliferation of red cell progenitor cells, endogenous erythropoietin production and ESA half-life. Estimated patient specific parameters showed excellent alignment with previously conducted clinical studies in hemodialysis patients. Further, the model qualitatively and quantitatively reflected empirical hemoglobin dynamics in demographically, anthropometrically and clinically diverse patients and accurately predicted the Hgb response to ESA therapy in individual patients for up to 21 weeks. The findings suggest that estimated model parameters can be used as a proxy for parameters that are clinically very difficult to quantify. The presented method has the potential to provide new insights into the individual pathophysiology of renal anemia and its association with clinical outcomes and can potentially be used to guide personalized anemia treatment.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195918</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccba:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Doris H.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing dietary fish oil (FO) with palm oil (PO) in juvenile Nile tilapia, &lt;i&gt;Oreochromis niloticus&lt;/i&gt; (9.34± 0.02g initial weight) with emphasis on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities as well as serum biochemical parameters. Also, lysozyme activity (LYZ), respiratory burst (RB), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and resistance to &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus iniae&lt;/i&gt; were investigated. Fish were stocked in 15 rectangular fiber glass tanks (150× 60× 40 cm) at 40 fish per tank with water maintained at 210 litres. Fish were fed five isonitrogenous (33% crude protein) and isolipidic (10% lipid) diets with PO included at 0% (0% PO), 25% (25% PO), 50% (50%PO), 75% (75% PO) and 100% (100% PO) for 8 weeks. The findings demonstrated that growth, and feed utilization was not compromised when PO was used in place of FO either partially or totally. Except for protease activity which was not significantly altered, lipase and amylase activities were significantly altered when FO was replaced with PO. There were no significant differences among treatments for CAT, SOD and LYZ. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) in fish fed 100% PO was significantly lower than all other groups whiles total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of fish fed 0% PO was significantly higher than all other groups. Fish fed 0% PO, 25% PO and 50% PO had glutathione reductase (GR) significantly higher than fish fed 75% PO and 100% PO. RB in fish fed 0% PO were significantly lower than fish fed 75% PO and 100% PO. Also, fish fed 0% PO had significantly lower total protein (TP) compared with groups fed 50% PO and 75% PO. Fish fed diets with PO had similar resistance ability to &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus iniae&lt;/i&gt; as those fed diets with FO. However, the liver function was likely to be compromised due to the increase in aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatas (ALP) along increasing PO inclusion levels. AST, total protein, triacylglycerol (TAG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly higher (p&amp;lt;0.05) in groups fed higher levels of PO. This study therefore concludes that feeding tilapia fingerlings with diets containing PO affects antioxidant and innate immune parameters negatively due to the reduction in LYS, TAC, GR, MDA, CAT, SOD and GSHpx.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196100</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67af:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Larbi Ayisi, Jinliang Zhao, Jun-Wei Wu&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively reviewed the evolution of segmentectomy for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and the feasibility of multi- and single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Of 348 patients undergoing surgery for TB, the medical records of 121 patients undergoing segmentectomy between January 1996 and November 2015 were reviewed. Clinical information and computed tomography (CT) image characteristics were investigated and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighteen patients underwent direct or intended thoracotomy. Sixty-four underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy (VATS), including 53 multi-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (MITS), and 11 single-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (SITS). Thirty-nine were converted to thoracotomy. The intended thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) and hospital stay (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) than the VATS group although the VATS group had higher grade of cavity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007). The intended thoracotomy group did not differ from converted thoracotomy in operative time, blood loss, or hospital stay, and the grade of pleural thickening was higher in the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). The converted thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss, hospital stay, and complication rate than the MITS group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009, respectively). The MITS group had lower pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, cavity, and tuberculoma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.017, respectively). The SITS group had lower grading in pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, and aspergilloma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, 0.010, and 0.031, respectively). Four patients in the intended thoracotomy group and seven in the converted thoracotomy group had complications compared with three patients in the MITS and two in the SITS group. Risk factors of conversion were pleural thickening and peribronchial lymph node calcification.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Although segmentectomy is technically challenging in patients with pulmonary TB, it could be safely performed using MITS or SITS and should be attempted in selected patients.

Our results demonstrated the effectiveness of memories in LSTM and showed that our de novo profile generator, SPBuild, achieved higher performance than that of existing methods for profile prediction of beta-strands, where long-range interactions of amino acids are important and are known to be difficult for the existing window-based prediction methods.

Our findings will be useful for the development of other prediction methods related to biological sequences by machine learning methods.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196621</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196621</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196621</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Chanki Yu</name></author><published>1524603600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Correction: Acral melanoma detection using a convolutional neural network for dermoscopy images</title><updated>1524603600000</updated><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><fingerprint>7ba44a0d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196621</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chanki Yu, Sejung Yang, Wonoh Kim, Jinwoong Jung, Kee-Yang Chung, Sang Wook Lee, Byungho Oh&lt;/p&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fbd:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chanki Yu, Sejung Yang, Wonoh Kim, Jinwoong Jung, Kee-Yang Chung, Sang Wook Lee, Byungho Oh&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05150-9</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Sebastian Olbrich</name></author><published>1526454000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Treating brainwaves is not an option</title><crawled>1526473042015</crawled><fingerprint>bcef6c3f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05150-9</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05150-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05150-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05150-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16368e2285f:3fa1a1d:3dd877af</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05150-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05150-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196166</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196166</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Tatiane Dobrzanski</name></author><published>1524690000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Bacillus megaterium&amp;lt;/i&gt; strains derived from water and soil exhibit differential responses to the herbicide mesotrione</title><updated>1524690000000</updated><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><fingerprint>a8f8ef66</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196166</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatiane Dobrzanski, Fernanda Gravina, Bruna Steckling, Luiz R.

The intense use of herbicides for weed control in agriculture causes selection pressure on soil microbiota and water ecosystems, possibly resulting in changes to microbial processes, such as biogeochemical cycles. These xenobiotics may increase the production of reactive oxygen species and consequently affect the survival of microorganisms, which need to develop strategies to adapt to these conditions and maintain their ecological functionality. This study analyzed the adaptive responses of bacterial isolates belonging to the same species, originating from two different environments (water and soil), and subjected to selection pressure by herbicides. The effects of herbicide Callisto and its active ingredient, mesotrione, induced different adaptation strategies on the cellular, enzymatic, and structural systems of two &lt;i&gt;Bacillus megaterium&lt;/i&gt; isolates obtained from these environments. The lipid saturation patterns observed may have affected membrane permeability in response to this herbicide. Moreover, this may have led to different levels of responses involving superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, and enzyme polymorphisms. Due to these response systems, the strain isolated from water exhibited higher growth rates than did the soil strain, in evaluations made in oligotrophic culture media, which would be more like that found in semi-pristine aquatic environments. The influence of the intracellular oxidizing environments, which changed the mode of degradation of mesotrione in our experimental model and produced different metabolites, can also be observed in soil and water at sites related to agriculture. Since the different metabolites may present different levels of toxicity, we suggest that this fact should be considered in studies on the fate of agrochemicals in different environments.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196166</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b4:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tatiane Dobrzanski, Fernanda Gravina, Bruna Steckling, Luiz R.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that quantifies the magnetic susceptibility distribution within biological tissues. QSM calculates the underlying magnetic susceptibility by deconvolving the tissue magnetic field map with a unit dipole kernel. However, this deconvolution problem is ill-posed. The morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI) introduces total variation (TV) to regularize the susceptibility reconstruction. However, MEDI results still contain artifacts near tissue boundaries because MEDI only imposes TV constraint on voxels inside smooth regions. We introduce a Morphology-Adaptive TV (MATV) for improving TV-regularized QSM. The MATV method first classifies imaging target into smooth and nonsmooth regions by thresholding magnitude gradients. In the dipole inversion for QSM, the TV regularization weights are a monotonically decreasing function of magnitude gradients. Thus, voxels inside smooth regions are assigned with larger weights than those in nonsmooth regions. Using phantom and in vivo datasets, we compared the performance of MATV with that of MEDI. MATV results had better visual quality than MEDI results, especially near tissue boundaries. Preliminary brain imaging results illustrated that MATV has potential to improve the reconstruction of regions near tissue boundaries.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196922</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475055:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Li Guo, Yingjie Mei, Jijing Guan, Xiangliang Tan, Yikai Xu, Wufan Chen, Qianjin Feng, Yanqiu Feng&lt;/p&gt;

Coral reefs protect islands from tropical storm waves and provide goods and services for millions of islanders worldwide. Yet it is unknown how coral reefs in general, and carbonate production in particular, will respond to sea-level rise and thermal stress associated with climate change. This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether that value varied across habitats. Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs.

Coral reefs protect islands from tropical storm waves and provide goods and services for millions of islanders worldwide. Yet it is unknown how coral reefs in general, and carbonate production in particular, will respond to sea-level rise and thermal stress associated with climate change. This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether that value varied across habitats. Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs. The value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production became negative varied across habitats, with highest values on inner reefs. These results suggest that some inner reefs tend to produce less carbonate, and therefore need higher coral cover to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise than outer and patch reefs. These results also suggest that inner reefs are more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other habitats, which stresses the need for effective land-use practices as the climate continues to change. Averaging across all reef habitats, the rate of carbonate production was 9.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 7.9 mm y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of potential vertical accretion. Such rates of vertical accretion are higher than projected averages of sea-level rise for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate-change scenarios 2.6, 4.5, and 6, but lower than for the RCP scenario 8.5.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/441/eaat8531?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/441/eaat8531.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Tully, H.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is known to provide neuroprotective effect in the central nervous system. However, the detailed mechanism remains far more elusive. This study was designed to investigate the relevant mechanisms of DEX&apos;s neuroprotective effect. Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were injected with dexmedetomidine and/or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally, and inflammatory cytokines in serum and in the hippocampus were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NF-κB in the brain tissue extracts was analyzed with western-blot. Then, we investigated whether NF-κB inhibitor prevents the elevation of inflammatory cytokines in rats injected with LPS. Our results indicated that compared with the control group, the rats exposed to LPS showed significant cognitive dysfunction. When compared to controls, the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the serum and hippocampus homogenate were increased in rats treated with LPS. DEX pretreatment inhibited the rats&apos; TNF-α, IL-6 and NF-κB levels induced by LPS. In response to LPS, PDTC pretreatment restrains the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6). Rats treated with PDTC and DEX alongside LPS exhibited less TNF-α and IL-6 than the LPS treated group. In combination, PDTC and DEX showed addictive effects. Our data suggest that DEX exerts a neuroprotective effect through NF-κB in part after LPS-induced cognitive dysfunction.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196897</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3aed:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaobao Zhang, Fang Yan, Jiying Feng, Haitao Qian, Zhi Cheng, Qianqian Yang, Yong Wu, Zhibin Zhao, Aimin Li, Hang Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC.

Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001). K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses.

Enniatins are common contaminants of food and feed and belong to the group of the “emerging” mycotoxins, which are produced by various &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species. Although a wide range of toxic effects, like antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and cytotoxic properties, have been described &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, so far, no cases of mycotoxicosis connected to enniatins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are reported. Among this group of mycotoxins, enniatin B and enniatin B1 are the most prevalent compounds and therefore are present in the human diet. Enniatins can reach systemic circulation, thus, the investigation of possible neurotoxic effects is of importance. Different cerebral cells were used to address effects on cell death having an impact on the blood-brain barrier. The influence of enniatin B and enniatin B1 on cellular viability was examined via Cell Counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) in three different cell types of the blood-brain barrier: porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1). CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to enniatin B (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.9 μM) and enniatin B1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.4 μM) than both endothelial cell types. In CCF-STTG1 cells, caspase-3 activation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were evaluated. Both compounds did not induce any LDH release and only enniatin B increased caspase-3 activity as a marker for apoptosis. The transport kinetics of enniatin B and enniatin B1 across the blood-brain barrier &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated using PBCEC, cultivated on Transwell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; filter inserts. Analysis of the apical and the basolateral compartment by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed high influx rates for enniatin B and enniatin B1. Thus, both compounds can reach the brain parenchyma where neurotoxic effects cannot be ruled out.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197406</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b6:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Isabel Krug, Matthias Behrens, Melanie Esselen, Hans-Ulrich Humpf&lt;/p&gt;

However, whether and how robust DNA repair machinery promotes longevity is elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ATM-centered DNA damage response (DDR) progressively declines with senescence and age, while low dose of chloroquine (CQ) activates ATM, promotes DNA damage clearance, rescues age-related metabolic shift, and prolongs replicative lifespan. Molecularly, ATM phosphorylates SIRT6 deacetylase and thus prevents MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Extra copies of &lt;i&gt;Sirt6 &lt;/i&gt;extend lifespan in &lt;i&gt;Atm-/-&lt;/i&gt; mice, with restored metabolic homeostasis.

However, whether and how robust DNA repair machinery promotes longevity is elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ATM-centered DNA damage response (DDR) progressively declines with senescence and age, while low dose of chloroquine (CQ) activates ATM, promotes DNA damage clearance, rescues age-related metabolic shift, and prolongs replicative lifespan. Molecularly, ATM phosphorylates SIRT6 deacetylase and thus prevents MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Extra copies of &lt;i&gt;Sirt6 &lt;/i&gt;extend lifespan in &lt;i&gt;Atm-/-&lt;/i&gt; mice, with restored metabolic homeostasis. Moreover, the treatment with CQ remarkably extends lifespan of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, but not the ATM-1 mutants. In a progeria mouse model with low DNA repair capacity, long-term administration of CQ ameliorates premature ageing features and extends lifespan. Thus, our data highlights a pro-longevity role of ATM, for the first time establishing direct causal links between robust DNA repair machinery and longevity, and providing therapeutic strategy for progeria and age-related metabolic diseases.</description><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025171?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025171?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Joshua W.

Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 μg/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male &lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&lt;/i&gt;. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 μg/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197259</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b7a:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ronald David MacLaren, Kathryn Wisniewski, Christina MacLaren&lt;/p&gt;

Phylogeny of hard ticks (Ixodidae) remains unresolved. Mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) are increasingly used to resolve phylogenetic controversies, but remain unavailable for the entire large &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt; genus. &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma asiaticum&lt;/i&gt; is a parasitic tick distributed throughout the Asia. As a result of great morphological variability, two subspecies have been recognised historically; until a morphological data-based synonymization was proposed. However, this hypothesis was never tested using molecular data. Therefore, objectives of this study were to: 1. sequence the first &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt; mitogenome; 2. scrutinise the proposed synonymization using molecular data, i.e. complete mitogenomes of both subspecies: &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;asiaticum and kozlovi&lt;/i&gt;; 3. conduct phylogenomic and comparative analyses of all available Ixodidae mitogenomes. Results corroborate the proposed synonymization: the two mitogenomes are almost identical (99.6%). Genomic features of both mitogenomes are standard for Metastriata; which includes the presence of two control regions and all three &amp;quot;Tick-Box&amp;quot; motifs. Gene order and strand distribution are perfectly conserved for the entire Metastriata group. Suspecting compositional biases, we conducted phylogenetic analyses (29 almost complete mitogenomes) using homogeneous and heterogeneous (CAT) models of substitution. The results were congruent, apart from the deep-level topology of prostriate ticks (&lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt;): the homogeneous model produced a monophyletic &lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt;, but the CAT model produced a paraphyletic &lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt; (and thereby Prostriata), divided into Australasian and non-Australasian clades. This topology implies that all metastriate ticks have evolved from the ancestor of the non-Australian branch of prostriate ticks. Metastriata was divided into three clades: 1. Amblyomminae and Rhipicephalinae (&lt;i&gt;Rhipicephalus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dermacentor&lt;/i&gt;); 2. Haemaphysalinae and Bothriocrotoninae, plus &lt;i&gt;Amblyomma sphenodonti&lt;/i&gt;; 3. &lt;i&gt;Amblyomma elaphense&lt;/i&gt;, basal to all Metastriata. We conclude that mitogenomes have the potential to resolve the long-standing debate about the evolutionary history of ticks, but heterogeneous evolutionary models should be used to alleviate the effects of compositional heterogeneity on deep-level relationships.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197524</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7bf:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhi-Qiang Liu, Yan-Feng Liu, Nuer Kuermanali, Deng-Feng Wang, Shi-Jun Chen, Hui-Ling Guo, Li Zhao, Jun-Wei Wang, Tao Han, Yuan-Zhi Wang, Jie Wang, Chen-Feng Shen, Zhuang-Zhi Zhang, Chuang-Fu Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt;, currently affecting more than 200 million people. Among the various species of this parasite that infect humans, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; is the most common. Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study, we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity.

Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt;, currently affecting more than 200 million people. Among the various species of this parasite that infect humans, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; is the most common. Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study, we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this, we investigated systemic acute toxicity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice. Treated mice showed no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or histological parameters compared to non-treated animals. Epiisopilosine showed potential as a schistosomicidal drug: it did not cause acute toxicity and it displayed an acceptable safety profile in the animal model.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321802v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/15/321802</canonicalUrl><author><name>Lin, X.</name></author><published>1526367600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Fast Nonnegative Matrix Factorization andApplications to Pattern Extraction, Deconvolutionand Imputation [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1526407468561</crawled><fingerprint>f7f9d6e8</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321802v1?rss=1</originId><description>Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a technique widely used in various fields, including artificial intelligence (AI), signal processing and bioinformatics.

Insect growth regulator insecticides mimic the action of hormones on the growth and development of insect pests. However, they can affect the development of non-target arthropods. In the present study, we tested the effects of the growth regulator insecticide fenoxycarb on several endpoints in the freshwater crustacean &lt;i&gt;Gammarus fossarum&lt;/i&gt; (Amphipoda). Females carrying embryos in their open brood pouch were exposed to 50 μg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; fenoxycarb throughout the entire oogenesis (i.e. 21 days). After exposure, newborn individuals from exposed embryos were removed from the maternal open brood pouch for lipidomic analysis, while males were added to assess the reproductive success. After fertilization, the lipid profile, energy reserve content (lipids, proteins and glycogen), and activity of phenoloxidase − an enzyme involved in the immune response − were measured in females. No significant effect of fenoxycarb exposure was observed on the lipid profile of both newborn individuals and females, while reproductive success was severely impaired in exposed females. Particularly, precopulatory behavior was significantly reduced and fertilized eggs were unviable. This study highlighted the deleterious effects of the insect growth regulator fenoxycarb on gammarid reproduction, which could have severe repercussions on population dynamics.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196461</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d74a:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hélène Arambourou, Inmaculada Fuertes, Emmanuelle Vulliet, Gaëlle Daniele, Patrice Noury, Nicolas Delorme, Khedidja Abbaci, Carlos Barata&lt;/p&gt;

As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304949v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/22/304949</canonicalUrl><author><name>Saad, M.

For example, evidence-based clinical decisions regarding lung diseases require the segmentation of nodules, tumors, or cancers. However, the tendencies of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) to be large-sized, irregularly shaped, and to grow against the surrounding structures can cause even expert clinicians to experience difficulty with accurate segmentation. Methods: An automated delineation tool based on spatial analysis was developed and studied on 25 sets of CT scans of primary NSCLCs with diverse radiological characteristics (sizes, shapes, contouring, localization, and microenvironment). Manual and automated gross delineations of the gross tumor were compared using a specific metric built based on spatially overlapping pixels. Results: The proposed algorithm exhibited robustness in terms of the tumor size (5.32 - 18.24 mm), shape (spherical or non-spherical), contouring (lobulated, spiculated, or cavitated), localization (solitary, pleural, mediastinal, endobronchial, or tagging), and microenvironment (left or right lobe), with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates of 80-98%, 85-99%, and 84-99%, respectively. Conclusions: Small discrepancies were observed between the manual and automated delineations. These might have risen from the variability in the practitioners&apos; definitions of ROIs or from imaging artifacts that reduced the tissue resolution.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304949v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162eceed7c5:58838b2:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Purpose: Quantitative reasoning in medical decision science relies on the delineation of pathological objects.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Epiretinal traction is not responsible only for epiretinal but also intraretinal changes. This study aims to describe structural and vascular intraretinal changes after macular peeling in idiopathic (iERM) vs diabetic ERM (dERM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective interventional study on forty-two eyes, 23 with iERMs and 19 with dERMs, undergoing ERM-ILM peeling. We performed SD-OCT preoperatively, 1 and 6 months postoperatively to assess central macular thickness (CMT), intraretinal cysts (IC) and/or continuous ectopic inner foveal layers (CEIFL), superficial and deep capillary free zone (CFZ) area on OCT-A. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as a Müller cells marker, was detected immunohistochemically on ILM specimens, to assess Müller cells iatrogenic damage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The CEIFLs were significantly more common in iERMs (12 (52.2%) in iERMs vs 2 (10.5%) in dERMs, p = 0.004), whereas ICs in dERMs (6 (26.1%) in iERMs vs 17 (89.5%) in dERMs, p&amp;lt;0.001). Median preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/50 [20/40-20/66] and 20/33 [20/25-20/40] in iERMs and 20/100 [20/66-20/200] and 20/50 [20/50-20/66] in dERMs, respectively. Median preoperative and postoperative CMT was 423 [370–488] and 364 [329–382] μm in iERM group and 465 [447–503] and 378 [359–433] μm in dERM group, respectively. The BCVA improvement and reduction of CMT thickness were significant in both groups (p&amp;lt;0.001). The presence of CEIFL was associated with lower BCVA in iERMs. Deep CFZ network significantly increased only in dERMs, passing from 0.34 [0.29–0.42] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; preoperatively to 0.56 [0.46–0.6] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 6-month follow-up (p&amp;lt;0.001). The GFAP expression was significantly higher in dERMs (p = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The intraretinal changes are different in iERMs and dERMs, as increased expression of CEIFLs in iERMs vs ICs in dERMs. The CEIFLs are associated with worse anatomical and functional outcomes in iERMs, whereas GFAP espression in peeled ILMs is higher in dERMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197065</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475067:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mario R.

Plant leaves of different ages differ in nutrients and toxic metabolites and thus exhibit various resistance levels against insect herbivores. However, little is known about the influence of leaf ontogeny on plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects. In this study, we found that the green peach aphid, &lt;i&gt;Myzus persicae&lt;/i&gt;, preferred to settle on young cabbage leaves compared with mature or old leaves, although young leaves contained the highest concentration of glucosinolates. Furthermore, aphids feeding on young leaves had higher levels of glucosinolates in their body, but aphids performed better on young leaves in terms of body weight and population growth. Phloem sap of young leaves had higher amino acid:sugar molar ratio than mature leaves, and aphids feeding on young leaves showed two times longer phloem feeding time and five times more honeydew excretion than on other leaves. These results indicate that aphids acquired the highest amount of nutrients and defensive metabolites when feeding on young cabbage leaves that are strong natural plant sinks. Accordingly, we propose that aphids generally prefer to obtain more nutrition rather than avoiding host plant defense, and total amount of nutrition that aphids could obtain is significantly influenced by leaf ontogeny or source-sink status of feeding sites.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196219</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb9b:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by He-He Cao, Zhan-Feng Zhang, Xiao-Feng Wang, Tong-Xian Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Bacterial spot caused by &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas arboricola&lt;/i&gt; pv. &lt;i&gt;pruni&lt;/i&gt; (Xap) is a major threat to &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species worldwide. The molecular mechanisms of peach resistance to Xap during early leaf infection were investigated by RNA-Seq analysis of two &lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt; cultivars, ‘Redkist’ (resistant), and ‘JH Hale’ (susceptible) at 30 minutes, 1 and 3 hours-post-infection (hpi). Both cultivars exhibited extensive modulation of gene expression at 30 mpi, which reduced significantly at 1 hpi, increasing again at 3 hpi. Overall, 714 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in ‘Redkist’ (12% at 30 mpi and 1 hpi and 88% at 3 hpi). In ‘JH Hale’, 821 DEGs were identified (47% at 30 mpi and 1 hpi and 53% at 3 hpi). Highly up-regulated genes (fold change &gt; 100) at 3 hpi exhibited higher fold change values in ‘Redkist’ than in ‘JH Hale’. RNA-Seq bioinformatics analyses were validated by RT-qPCR. In both cultivars, DEGs included genes with putative roles in perception, signal transduction, secondary metabolism, and transcription regulation, and there were defense responses in both cultivars, with enrichment for the gene ontology terms, ‘immune system process’, ‘defense response’, and ‘cell death’. There were particular differences between the cultivars in the intensity and kinetics of modulation of expression of genes with putative roles in transcriptional activity, secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, and receptor and signaling processes. Analysis of differential exon usage (DEU) revealed that both cultivars initiated remodeling their transcriptomes at 30 mpi; however, ‘Redkist’ exhibited alternative exon usage for a greater number of genes at every time point compared with ‘JH Hale’. Candidate resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;WRKY&lt;/i&gt;-like, &lt;i&gt;CRK&lt;/i&gt;-like, &lt;i&gt;Copper amine oxidase&lt;/i&gt;-like, and &lt;i&gt;TIR-NBS-LRR&lt;/i&gt;-like) are of interest for further functional characterization with the aim of elucidating their role in &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; spp. resistance to Xap.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196590</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae80:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Gervasi, Patrizia Ferrante, Maria Teresa Dettori, Marco Scortichini, Ignazio Verde&lt;/p&gt;

The stolbur phytoplasma vector &lt;i&gt;Hyalesthes obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; is generally considered as a polyphagous species associated with numerous wild and cultivated plants. However, recent research in southeastern Europe, the distribution centre of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; and the area of most stolbur-inflicted crop diseases, points toward specific host-plant associations of the vector, indicating specific vector-based transmission routes. Here, we study the specificity of populations associated with four host-plants using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers, and we evaluate the evolution of host-shifts in &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt;. Host-plant use was confirmed for &lt;i&gt;Convolvulus arvensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Urtica dioica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vitex agnus-castus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Crepis foetida&lt;/i&gt;. Mitochondrial genetic analysis showed sympatric occurrence of three phylogenetic lineages that were ecologically delineated by host-plant preference, but were morphologically inseparable. Nuclear data supported the existence of three genetic groups (Evanno’s ΔK(3) = 803.72) with average genetic membership probabilities &gt; 90%.

Background &lt;p&gt;New methodologies to estimate gestational age (GA) at birth are demanded to face the limited access to obstetric ultrasonography and imprecision of postnatal scores. The study analyzed the correlation between neonatal skin thickness and pregnancy duration. Secondarily, it investigated the influence of fetal growth profiles on tissue layer dimensions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;In a feasibility study, 222 infants selected at a term-to-preterm ratio of 1:1 were assessed. Reliable information on GA was based on the early ultrasonography-based reference. The thicknesses of the epidermal and dermal skin layers were examined using high-frequency ultrasonography. We scanned the skin over the forearm and foot plantar surface of the newborns. A multivariate regression model was adjusted to determine the correlation of GA with skin layer dimensions. The best model to correlate skin thickness with GA was fitted using the epidermal layer on the forearm site, adjusted to cofactors, as follows: Gestational age (weeks) = −28.0 + 12.8 &lt;i&gt;Ln&lt;/i&gt; (Thickness) − 4.4 Incubator staying; &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.604 (P&amp;lt;0.001). In this model, the constant value for the standard of fetal growth was statistically null. The dermal layer thickness on the forearm and plantar surfaces had a negative moderate linear correlation with GA (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = −0.370, P&amp;lt;0.001 and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = −0.421, P&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). The univariate statistical analyses revealed the influence of underweight and overweight profiles on neonatal skin thickness at birth. Of the 222 infants, 53 (23.9%) had inappropriate fetal growths expected for their GA. Epidermal thickness was not fetal growth standard dependent as follows: 172.2 (19.8) μm for adequate for GA, 171.4 (20.6) μm for SGA, and 177.7 (15.2) μm for LGA (P = 0.525, mean [SD] on the forearm).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The analysis highlights a new opportunity to relate GA at birth to neonatal skin layer thickness. As this parameter was not influenced by the standard of fetal growth, skin maturity can contribute to clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196542</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae79:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriela Luiza Nogueira Vitral, Regina Amélia P.

The vertebrate neuroepithelium is composed of elongated progenitors whose reciprocal attachments ensure the continuity of the ventricular wall. As progenitors commit to differentiation, they translocate their nucleus basally and eventually withdraw their apical endfoot from the ventricular surface. However, the mechanisms allowing this delamination process to take place while preserving the integrity of the neuroepithelial tissue are still unclear. Here, we show that Notch signaling, which is classically associated with an undifferentiated state, remains active in prospective neurons until they delaminate. During this transition period, prospective neurons rapidly reduce their apical surface and only later down-regulate N-Cadherin levels. Upon Notch blockade, nascent neurons disassemble their junctions but fail to reduce their apical surface. This disrupted sequence weakens the junctional network and eventually leads to breaches in the ventricular wall. We also provide evidence that the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) promotes differentiation by reducing Notch signaling through a &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition mechanism. However, during the delamination process, the ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1) transiently blocks this &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition and sustains Notch activity to defer differentiation. We propose that the fine-tuned balance between Notch &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-activation and &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition allows neuroepithelial cells to seamlessly delaminate from the ventricular wall as they commit to differentiation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OBYDT1hFD-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>144</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16317b82452:13eb348:a96d255</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chooyoung Baek, Lucy Freem, Rosette Goïame, Helen Sang, Xavier Morin, Samuel Tozer&lt;/p&gt;

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a zinc-dependent protease associated with early immune responses to &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection, macrophage recruitment and granuloma formation. We evaluated whether adjunctive inhibition of MMP-9 could improve the response to standard TB treatment in a mouse model that develops necrotic lesions. Six weeks after an aerosol infection with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, C3HeB/FeJ mice received standard TB treatment (12 weeks) comprising rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide alone or in combination with either anti-MMP-9 antibody, etanercept (positive control) or isotype antibody (negative control) for 6 weeks. Anti-MMP-9 and the isotype control had comparable high serum exposures and expected terminal half-life. The relapse rate in mice receiving standard TB treatment was 46.6%. Compared to the standard TB treatment, relapse rates in animals that received adjunctive treatments with anti-MMP-9 antibody or etanercept were significantly decreased to 25.9% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) and 29.8% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019) respectively, but were not different from the arm that received the isotype control antibody (25.9%). Immunostaining demonstrated localization of MMP-9 primarily in macrophages in both murine and human lung tissues infected with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting the importance of MMP-9 in TB pathogenesis.

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a zinc-dependent protease associated with early immune responses to &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection, macrophage recruitment and granuloma formation. We evaluated whether adjunctive inhibition of MMP-9 could improve the response to standard TB treatment in a mouse model that develops necrotic lesions. Six weeks after an aerosol infection with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, C3HeB/FeJ mice received standard TB treatment (12 weeks) comprising rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide alone or in combination with either anti-MMP-9 antibody, etanercept (positive control) or isotype antibody (negative control) for 6 weeks. Anti-MMP-9 and the isotype control had comparable high serum exposures and expected terminal half-life. The relapse rate in mice receiving standard TB treatment was 46.6%. Compared to the standard TB treatment, relapse rates in animals that received adjunctive treatments with anti-MMP-9 antibody or etanercept were significantly decreased to 25.9% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) and 29.8% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019) respectively, but were not different from the arm that received the isotype control antibody (25.9%). Immunostaining demonstrated localization of MMP-9 primarily in macrophages in both murine and human lung tissues infected with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting the importance of MMP-9 in TB pathogenesis. These data suggest that the relapse rates in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice may be non-specifically improved by administration of antibodies in conjunction with standard TB treatments. Future studies are needed to evaluate the mechanism(s) leading to improved outcomes with adjunctive antibody treatments.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04931-6</link><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04931-6/d41586-018-04931-6_15712562.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>Jeff Tollefson</name></author><published>1524639600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Can the world kick its fossil-fuel addiction fast enough?</title><crawled>1524654780016</crawled><fingerprint>3435d359</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04931-6</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can the world kick its fossil-fuel addiction fast enough?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can the world kick its fossil-fuel addiction fast enough?, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04931-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04931-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Clean energy is growing quickly.

Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal deaths. The aetiology of preeclampsia is largely unknown but a polygenetic component is assumed. To explore this hypothesis, we performed an in-depth whole-exome sequencing study in women with (cases, N = 50) and without (controls, N = 50) preeclampsia. The women were identified in an unselected cohort of 2,545 pregnant women based on data from the Danish National Patient Registry and the Medical Birth Registry. Matching DNA was obtained from a biobank containing excess blood from routine antenatal care visits. Novogene performed the whole-exome sequencing blinded to preeclampsia status. Variants for comparison between cases and controls were filtered in the Ingenuity Variant Analysis software. We applied two different strategies; a &lt;i&gt;disease association panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included variants in single genes associated with established clinical risk factors for preeclampsia, and a &lt;i&gt;gene panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included biological pathways harbouring genes previously reported to be associated with preeclampsia. Variant variability was compared in cases and controls at the level of biological processes, signalling pathways, and in single genes. Regardless of the applied strategy and the level of variability examined, we consistently found positive correlations between variant numbers in cases and controls (all R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s&gt;0.88). Contrary to what was expected, cases carried fewer variants in biological processes and signalling pathways than controls (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-values ≤0.02). In conclusion, our findings challenge the hypothesis of a polygenetic aetiology for preeclampsia with a common network of susceptibility genes. The greater genetic diversity among controls may suggest a protective role of genetic diversity against the development of preeclampsia.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197217</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219b:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anette Tarp Hansen, Jens Magnus Bernth Jensen, Anne-Mette Hvas, Mette Christiansen&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of retrospective studies that investigated the association of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with the overall survival (OS) of patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A detailed literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and PubMed databases up to August 28, 2017, for related research publications written in English. We extracted the data from these studies and combined the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the correlation between CRP levels and OS in patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five studies with a total of 816 participants from several countries were enrolled in this current meta-analysis. In a pooled analysis of all the publications, increased serum CRP levels had an adverse prognostic effect on the overall survival of patients with bone neoplasms. However, the combined data showed no significant relationship between the level of CRP and OS in Asian patients (HR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.86–3.49; P = 0.125). Similar trends were observed in patients with bone neoplasms when stratified by ethnicity, histology, metastasis and study sample size.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The results of this meta-analysis suggest that increased CRP expression indicates a poorer prognosis in patients with bone neoplasms.

In this paper, an adaptive fractional order sliding mode control (AFSMC) scheme is designed for the current tracking control of the Boost-type converter in a Battery/Supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS). In order to stabilize the current, the adaptation rules based on state-observer and Lyapunov function are being designed. A fractional order sliding surface function is defined based on the tracking current error and adaptive rules. Furthermore, through fractional order analysis, the stability of the fractional order control system is proven, and the value of the fractional order (λ) is being investigated. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed AFSMC strategy is being verified by numerical simulations. The advantages of good transient response and robustness to uncertainty are being indicated by this design, when compared with a conventional integer order sliding mode control system.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196501</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d74d:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jianlin Wang, Dan Xu, Huan Zhou, Tao Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Alveolar epithelial cells are critical to the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which are associated with overexpression of type 2 cytokine IL-13. IL-13 is known to induce the production of profibrotic (e.g., periostin) and pro-inflammatory (e.g., eotaxin-3) mediators in human airway epithelial cells, but it remains unclear if human primary alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression following IL-13 stimulation. The goals of this study are to determine if alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression upon IL-13 stimulation, and if alveolar and airway epithelial cells from the same subjects have similar responses to IL-13. Paired alveolar and airway epithelial cells were isolated from donors without any lung disease, and cultured under submerged or air-liquid interface conditions with or without IL-13. Up-regulation of periostin protein and mRNA was observed in IL-13-stimulated alveolar epithelial cells, which was comparable to that in IL-13-stimulated paired airway epithelial cells. IL-13 also increased eotaxin-3 expression in alveolar epithelial cells, but the level of eotaxin mRNA was lower in alveolar epithelial cells than in airway epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that human alveolar epithelial cells are able to produce periostin and eotaxin in responses to IL-13 stimulation. This study suggests the need to further determine the contribution of alveolar epithelial cell-derived mediators to pulmonary fibrosis.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196256</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df0db9fe:45935cf:9f3b30f2</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yoko Ito, Reem Al Mubarak, Nicole Roberts, Kelly Correll, William Janssen, James Finigan, Rangnath Mishra, Hong Wei Chu&lt;/p&gt;

Mechanical stability is a key feature in the regulation of structural scaffolding proteins and their functions. Despite the abundance of α-helical structures among the human proteome and their undisputed importance in health and disease, the fundamental principles of their behavior under mechanical load are poorly understood. Talin and α-catenin are two key molecules in focal adhesions and adherens junctions, respectively. In this study, we used a combination of atomistic steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, polyprotein engineering, and single-molecule atomic force microscopy (smAFM) to investigate unfolding of these proteins. SMD simulations revealed that talin rod α-helix bundles as well as α-catenin α-helix domains unfold through stable 3-helix intermediates. While the 5-helix bundles were found to be mechanically stable, a second stable conformation corresponding to the 3-helix state was revealed. Mechanically weaker 4-helix bundles easily unfolded into a stable 3-helix conformation. The results of smAFM experiments were in agreement with the findings of the computational simulations. The disulfide clamp mutants, designed to protect the stable state, support the 3-helix intermediate model in both experimental and computational setups. As a result, multiple discrete unfolding intermediate states in the talin and α-catenin unfolding pathway were discovered. Better understanding of the mechanical unfolding mechanism of α-helix proteins is a key step towards comprehensive models describing the mechanoregulation of proteins.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z2y475sR2a8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163032286b6:a8a5d:ed160cc3</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vasyl V.

Now here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1706441&quot;&gt;the full writeup&lt;/a&gt; in NEJM, and futility appears to have been &lt;em&gt;le mot juste&lt;/em&gt;. There were two treatment groups (12 mg and 40 mg), and in neither one did the ADAS-cog or ADAS-ADL scores (scales for degree of dementia and ability to function) improve whatsoever. There was no difference in the people who had been scored at the start with milder Alzheimer’s, and no difference related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E#Alzheimer%27s_disease&quot;&gt;APOE4 status&lt;/a&gt;. The placebo group in general declined at a normal Alzheimer’s rate, so that’s not the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many other markers examined, and in every case treatment did nothing at all or did things that are hard to interpret, such as decreasing hippocampal volume (which has been noted in other anti-amyloid studies, and whose significance is actually not well understood). And all this was while cerebrospinal fluid measurements showed that all the amyloid species assayed decreased sharply in the treatment groups. This compound lowered 1-40 amyloid-beta, it lowered 1-42, it lowered APP-beta, all by like 70% and more, decreased brain amyloid itself (by PET imaging) and &lt;em&gt;nothing happened&lt;/em&gt;. An intelligent space alien with no history in human Alzheimer’s research would examine these results and conclude that the hypothesis that reducing cerebral amyloid is beneficial is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. The paper comes out and states as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past the efficacy data, or lack of same, the adverse events with drug treatment were notably higher, and in a dose-responsive manner. These included falls, weight loss, sleep disturbance, change in hair color, and suicidal ideation (that last one technically mild, but definitely real). So not only was there no benefit, there was some actual harm, which makes halting the trial absolutely the correct decision to make. But there &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13543784.2017.1369527?journalCode=ieid20&quot;&gt;are still&lt;/a&gt; BACE clinical trials &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/merck-study-may-signal-doom-for-a-broad-group-of-pivotal-alzheimers-studies/&quot;&gt;going on&lt;/a&gt;, and if you weren’t pessimistic about them before this trial, you should be now.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>56</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4897.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4897</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/19/4897/F1.medium.gif</url><height>202</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width></visual><author><name>Jenni Lehtimaki, Hanna Sinkko, Anna Hielm–Bȷorkman, Elina Salmela, Katriina Tiira, Tiina Laatikainen, Sanna Makelainen, Maria Kaukonen, Liisa Uusitalo, Ilkka Hanski, Hannes Lohi, Lasse Ruokolainen</name></author><published>1525803378000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Skin microbiota and allergic symptoms associate with exposure to environmental microbes [Applied Biological Sciences]</title><crawled>1525807602634</crawled><fingerprint>f0b4365</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4897.short?rss=1</originId><description>A rural environment and farming lifestyle are known to provide protection against allergic diseases.

Background &lt;p&gt;The discussion on the use of bevacizumab is still ongoing and often doctors are deterred from using bevacizumab due to legal or political issues. Bevacizumab is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), albeit unregistered for the disease. Therefore, in some countries ophthalmologists use the equally effective but expensive drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept. We describe the economic consequences of this dilemma surrounding AMD treatment from a societal perspective.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We modelled cost-effectiveness of treatment with ranibizumab (as-needed), aflibercept (bimonthly) and bevacizumab (as-needed). Effectiveness was estimated by systematic review and meta-analysis. The drug with the most favourable cost-effectiveness profile compared to bevacizumab was used for threshold analyses. First, we determined how much we overspend per injection. Second, we calculated the required effectiveness to justify the current price and the reasonable price for a drug leading to optimal vision. Finally, we estimated how much Europe overspends if bevacizumab is not first choice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab treatment costs €27,087 per year, about €4,000 less than aflibercept and €6,000 less than ranibizumab. With similar effectiveness for all drugs as shown by meta-analysis, bevacizumab was the most cost-effective. Aflibercept was chosen for threshold analyses. Aflibercept costs €943 per injection, but we determined that the maximum price to be cost-effective is €533. Alternatively, at its current price, aflibercept should yield about twice the visual gain. Even when optimal vision can be achieved, the maximum price for any treatment is €37,453 per year. Most importantly, Europe overspends €335 million yearly on AMD treatment when choosing aflibercept over bevacizumab.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab is the most cost-effective treatment for AMD, yet is not the standard of care across Europe. The registered drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept lead to large overspending without additional health benefits. Health authorities should consider taking steps to implement bevacizumab into clinical practice as first choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197670</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543c:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Freekje van Asten, Charlotte T.

The cutaneous silent period is an inhibitory evoked response that demonstrates a wide variety of responses in muscles of the human upper limb. Classically, the cutaneous silent period results in a characteristic muscle pattern of extensor inhibition and flexor facilitation within the upper limb, in the presence of nociceptive input. The aims of the current study were: 1) to primarily investigate the presence and characteristics of the cutaneous silent period response across multiple extensor and flexor muscles of the upper limb, and 2) to secondarily investigate the influence of stimulation site on this nociceptive reflex response. It was hypothesized that the cutaneous silent period would be present in all muscles, regardless of role (flexion/extension) or the stimulation site. Twenty-two healthy, university-age adults (14 males; 8 females; 23 ± 5 yrs) participated in the study. Testing consisted of three different stimulation sites (Digit II, V, and II+III nociceptive stimulation) during a low intensity, sustained muscle contraction, in which, 7 upper limb muscles were monitored via surface EMG recording electrodes. Distal muscles of the upper limb presented with the earliest reflex onset times, longest reflex duration, and lowest level of EMG suppression when compared to the more proximal muscles, regardless of extensor/flexor role. Additionally, the greatest overall inhibitory influence was expressed within the distal muscles. In conclusion, the present study provides a new level of refinement within the current understanding of the spinal organization associated with nociceptive input processing and the associated motor control of the upper limb. Subsequently, these results have further implications on the impact of nociception on supraspinal processing.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196129</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b2:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nathanial R.

In the latter case, mechanistic experiments and DFT-calculations support a homo-conjugate addition pathway.</description><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3645.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3645</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/16/E3645/F3.medium.gif</url><height>422</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width></visual><author><name>Gabriel Birzu, Oskar Hallatschek, Kirill S.

Soil salinity is a common and serious environmental problem worldwide. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered as bio-ameliorators of soil salinity tolerance in plants. However, few studies have addressed the possible benefits of AMF inoculation for medicinal plants under saline conditions. In this study, we examined the effects of colonization with two AMF, &lt;i&gt;Funneliformis mosseae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Diversispora versiformis&lt;/i&gt;, alone and in combination, on the growth and nutrient uptake of the medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Chrysanthemum morifolium&lt;/i&gt; (Hangbaiju) in a greenhouse salt stress experiment. After 6 weeks of a non-saline pretreatment, Hangbaiju plants with and without AMF were grown for five months under salinity levels that were achieved using 0, 50 and 200 mM NaCl. Root length, shoot and root dry weight, total dry weight, and root N concentration were higher in the mycorrhizal plants than in the non-mycorrhizal plants under conditions of moderate salinity, especially with &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;versiformis&lt;/i&gt; colonization. As salinity increased, mycorrhizal colonization and mycorrhizal dependence decreased. The enhancement of root N uptake is probably the main mechanism underlying salt tolerance in mycorrhizal plants. These results suggest that the symbiotic associations between the fungus &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;versiformis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;morifolium&lt;/i&gt; plants may be useful in biotechnological practice.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196408</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae6f:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yanhong Wang, Minqiang Wang, Yan Li, Aiping Wu, Juying Huang&lt;/p&gt;

And regular readers will also know that I’m quite skeptical that it’s going to have an immediate impact on the high-level functions of drug discovery (what target to go after, what molecules to make, which one should be the clinical candidate, etc.) Not everyone doing AI/machine-learning in the field is even talking about going after these, but those who are tend to go all the way. A few months ago, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/10/03/knock_six_years&quot;&gt;I wrote about&lt;/a&gt; a hype-fest presentation on this very thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the companies mentioned on it was BenevolentAI, from the UK. They themselves &lt;a href=&quot;http://benevolent.ai/news/announcements/benevolentai-raises-115m-for-ai-enabled-drug-development/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; just the other day that they’ve raised another $115 million, in a funding round that values the company at about &lt;em&gt;$2 billion&lt;/em&gt;, so I guess it’s time to have a look at them in particular. They say that “&lt;em&gt;BenevolentAI’s advanced technology is disrupting the pharmaceutical industry by lowering costs, decreasing failure rates and increasing the speed at which medicines are delivered to patients&lt;/em&gt;“. I had not noticed this happening, personally, but hey, lowering costs and decreasing failure rates are things we need very much in this business. How is this being done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company’s advanced technology has been shown to outperform human scientists in understanding the cause of disease and is capable of quickly generating drug candidates at scale.  The technology is also able to decipher the molecular process of disease and link these disease signatures within patients to ensure that the best drug candidate is given to the best patient responders – the ‘right drugs in the right patients’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the cause of disease”. “Quickly generating drug candidates at scale”. “Decipher the molecular process of disease”. Well, I can accuse these folks of several things, but not lack of ambition. Nor lack of self-promotion. Rather than rant on for a paragraph about each of those statements, I will just say that I am extremely skeptical that they can do any such things – at least not to the level needed to “disrupt the pharmaceutical industry”. I base that opinion on my own human experience over the last 28 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a great deal of difficulty understanding the cause of disease, just to pick that first claim. And I’m not sure at all if AI is ready to help across the board with that problem, because that would imply that we have enough data and we need help interpreting it. And while we could certainly use such help, I think that bigger problem is that we &lt;em&gt;just don’t know enough&lt;/em&gt; about cells, about organisms, and about disease. AI is going to be very good at digging through what we’ve already found, and the hope is that it’ll tell us, from time to time, “Hey guys, you’re sitting on something big here but you just haven’t realized it yet”. But producing new knowledge is something else again. Drawing correlations and connections is not really the same thing – new knowledge, in this field, comes from experimentation. More advanced AI could point us to the more fruitful areas to run experiments in: “Hey, there’s too much about long noncoding RNA that we really don’t understand and we need to shore up” (the gospel truth, by the way). Really impressive AI might predict pathways or connections that haven’t been confirmed by experiment, but look as if they should exist. But AI as it stands is (at best) just going to sift through and rearrange knowledge that we already have, not give us more of it, and I just don’t think we have enough on hand to “decipher the molecular process of disease”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest you think that I’m taking those quotes out of context, here’s some more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To achieve this, BenevolentAI has created a bioscience machine brain, purpose-built to discover new medicines and cures for disease.  Proprietary algorithms perform sophisticated reasoning on over 50 billion ingested and contextualised facts to extract knowledge and generate complex insights into the cause of diseases that have, until now, eluded human understanding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bioscience machine brain”, forsooth. Who, exactly, “contextualised” those fifty billion facts for it to chomp on? Fifty billion seconds is nearly 1600 years, guys, and putting biomedical facts in context can, at times, take even more than a second per fact. But what the hey, I’m not a bioscience machine brain. I hope that the PowerPoint deck that convinced people to part with $115 million is written at a less eye-rolling level than this press release; a person could pull a muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I honestly wish these folks luck. This is the way to find out if this stuff works. They are, I should note, some of the people behind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/29/the-rise-of-the-rise-of-the-machines&quot;&gt;most recent retrosynthesis software&lt;/a&gt; that I wrote about, and I thought that was pretty interesting. But that is a perfect example of taking existing knowledge and using algorithms to root through it and rearrange it in new and useful ways. Drug discovery in general could be improved by more of that – but I don’t think there’s room to improve it as much as the BenevolentAI people are claiming. I’ll give them credit for rolling up their sleeves and coming on down to see if it works. But I don’t think it’s going to go the way that press release says. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

The binding free energy changes between the wild‐type and mutants of the complex calculated by EE‐GMFCC are in good agreement with experimental results. The correlation coefficient (R) between the predicted binding energy changes and experimental values is 0.906 at the B3LYP/6‐31G*‐D level, based on the snapshot whose binding affinity is closest to the average result from the molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculation. The inclusion of the QM effects is important for accurate prediction of protein–protein binding affinities. Moreover, the self‐consistent calculation of PB solvation energy is required for accurate calculations of protein–protein binding free energies.

However, dimensionality of imaging data, together with a great variability of nuclear shapes present challenges for 3D morphological analysis. Thus, there is a compelling need for robust 3D nuclear morphometric techniques to carry out population-wise analysis. We propose a new approach that combines modeling, analysis, and interpretation of morphometric characteristics of cell nuclei and nucleoli in 3D. We use robust surface reconstruction that allows accurate approximation of 3D object boundary. Then, we compute geometric morphological measures characterizing the form of cell nuclei and nucleoli. Using these features, we compare over 450 nuclei with about 1,000 nucleoli of epithelial and mesenchymal prostate cancer cells, as well as 1,000 nuclei with over 2,000 nucleoli from serum-starved and proliferating fibroblast cells. Classification of sets of 9 and 15 cells achieves accuracy of 95.4% and 98%, respectively, for prostate cancer cells, and 95% and 98% for fibroblast cells. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine these methods for 3D nuclear shape modeling and morphometry into a highly parallel pipeline workflow for morphometric analysis of thousands of nuclei and nucleoli in 3D.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313411v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1632539c255:b6d709:5785ab88</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Quantitative analysis of morphological changes in a cell nucleus is important for understanding of nuclear architecture and their relationship with pathological conditions such as cancer.

High economic burden is associated with foodborne illnesses. Different disinfection methods are therefore employed in food processing industry; such as use of ultraviolet light or usage of surfaces with copper-containing alloys. However, all the disinfection methods currently in use have some shortcomings. In this work we show that copper doped TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotubes deposited on existing surfaces and illuminated with ceiling mounted fluorescent lights can retard the growth of &lt;i&gt;Listeria Innocua&lt;/i&gt; by 80% in seven hours of exposure to the fluorescent lights at different places in a food processing plant or in the laboratory conditions with daily reinocuation and washing. The disinfection properties of the surfaces seem to depend mainly on the temperature difference of the surface and the dew point, where for the maximum effectiveness the difference should be about 3 degrees celsius. The TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotubes have a potential to be employed for an economical and continuous disinfection of surfaces.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197308</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b1:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tilen Koklic, Štefan Pintarič, Irena Zdovc, Majda Golob, Polona Umek, Alma Mehle, Martin Dobeic, Janez Štrancar&lt;/p&gt;

Overconfidence has been reported to be a common bias among entrepreneurs and might be one cause of the high failure rates observed for new ventures. In this study, we investigate the overconfidence bias in a sample of 92 Austrian entrepreneurs, who responded to a general-knowledge questionnaire. Their levels of overconfidence were assessed by their responses to hard, medium and easy knowledge questions, and the relations of individual, organizational and environmental factors to the bias score were analyzed. The results confirmed that entrepreneurs are indeed prone to expressing overprecision, a type of overconfidence, but not when answering questions of all levels of difficulty. Being a single founder instead of a co-founder was identified as a significant predictor of overconfidence. Confidence, on the other hand, was associated with age and prior entrepreneurial experience, while accuracy was determined solely by age. The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506b:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Viktorija Ilieva, Thomas Brudermann, Ljubomir Drakulevski&lt;/p&gt;

Fisheries management is most effective when based on scientific estimates of sustainable fishing rates. While some simple approaches allow estimation of harvest limits, more data-intensive stock assessments are generally required to evaluate the stock’s biomass and fishing rates relative to sustainable levels. Here we evaluate how stock characteristics relate to the rate of new assessments in the United States. Using a statistical model based on time-to-event analysis and 569 coastal marine fish and invertebrate stocks landed in commercial fisheries, we quantify the impact of region, habitat, life-history, and economic factors on the annual probability of being assessed. Although the majority of landings come from assessed stocks in all regions, less than half of the regionally-landed species currently have been assessed. As expected, our time-to-event model identified landed tonnage and ex-vessel price as the dominant factors determining increased rates of new assessments. However, we also found that after controlling for landings and price, there has been a consistent bias towards assessing larger-bodied species. A number of vulnerable groups such as rockfishes (Scorpaeniformes) and groundsharks (Carcharhiniformes) have a relatively high annual probability of being assessed after controlling for their relatively small tonnage and low price. Due to relatively low landed tonnage and price of species that are currently unassessed, our model suggests that the number of assessed stocks will increase more slowly in future decades.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196483</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f66:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Neubauer, James T.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an increasing public health concern because of rapid lifestyle changes. Although there have been previous studies on the prevalence of MS in China, the prevalence may have changed with lifestyle changes over the last decade. To update this prevalence, we performed a cross-sectional survey among adults over 18 years old across China from May 2013 to July 2014. Participants underwent questionnaires and provided blood and urine samples for analysis. MS was defined according to the criteria of the China Diabetes Society. A total of 12570 individuals (45.2% men) with an average age of 48.8±15.3 (18–96) years were selected and invited to participate in the study. In total, 9310 (40.7% men) individuals completed the investigation, with a response rate of 74.1%. The prevalence of MS in China was 14.39% [95% confidence interval (CI): -3.75–32.53%], and the age-adjusted prevalence was 9.82% (95% CI: 9.03–10.61%; 7.78% in men and 6.76% in women; 7.39% in rural residents and 6.98% in urban residents). The highest prevalence occurred among adults aged 50–59 years (1.95%, 95% CI: 1.40–2.50%), and the lowest prevalence occurred among adults aged 40–49 years (0.74%, 95% CI: 0.38–1.10%); the prevalence was the highest in the south region and lowest in the east region (4.46% and 1.23%, respectively). The results of logistic regression analyses showed that age, urolithiasis, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, thiazide drugs intake, family history of diabetes and hypertension were all significantly associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (OR&gt;1). In addition, education, vitamin D intake and family history of urolithiasis are all protective factors (OR&amp;lt;1). Our results indicate that there was a high prevalence of MS in Chinese adults. Compared to the previous study 10 years ago, some preventive strategies have worked; however, further work on the prevention and treatment of MS remains necessary.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe36:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Lan, Zanlin Mai, Shiyu Zhou, Yang Liu, Shujue Li, Zhijian Zhao, Xiaolu Duan, Cao Cai, Tuo Deng, Wei Zhu, Wenqi Wu, Guohua Zeng&lt;/p&gt;

An R implementation of Melissa is publicly available at https://github.com/andreaskapou/Melissa.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197171</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197171</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Bedilu Alamirie Ejigu</name></author><published>1526677200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Spatial pattern and determinants of anaemia in Ethiopia</title><updated>1526677200000</updated><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><fingerprint>b9ff74f8</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197171</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bedilu Alamirie Ejigu, Eshetu Wencheko, Kiros Berhane&lt;/p&gt;
Anaemia is a condition in which the haemoglobin concentration falls below an established cut-off value due to a decrease in the number and size of red blood cells. The current study aimed (i) to assess the spatial pattern and (ii) to identify determinants related to anaemia using the third Ethiopian demographic health survey. To achieve these objectives, this study took into account the sampling weight and the clustered nature of the data. As a result, multilevel modeling has been used in the statistical analysis. The analysis included complete cases from 15,909 females, and 13,903 males. Among all subjects who agreed for hemeoglobin test, 5.22% males, and 16.60% females were anemic. In both binary and ordinal outcome modeling approaches, educational level, age, wealth index, BMI and HIV status were found to be significant predictors of anaemia prevalence. Furthermore, this study applied spatial methods to generate maps at regional level which could be useful for policy makers where great efforts should be concentrated to reduce the prevalence of anaemia. As revealed by Moran’s &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; test, significant spatial autocorrelation were noted across clusters. The risk of anaemia was found to vary across different regions, and higher prevalences were observed in Somali and Affar regions.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197171</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721c:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bedilu Alamirie Ejigu, Eshetu Wencheko, Kiros Berhane&lt;/p&gt;

Nutrient acquisition is a critical determinant for the competitive advantage for auto- and osmohetero- trophs alike. Nutrient limited growth is commonly described on a whole cell basis through reference to a maximum growth rate (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and a half-saturation constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;). This empirical application of a Michaelis-Menten like description ignores the multiple underlying feedbacks between physiology contributing to growth, cell size, elemental stoichiometry and cell motion. Here we explore these relationships with reference to the kinetics of the nutrient transporter protein, the transporter rate density at the cell surface (&lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt;; potential transport rate per unit plasma-membrane area), and diffusion gradients. While the half saturation value for the limiting nutrient increases rapidly with cell size, significant mitigation is afforded by cell motion (swimming or sedimentation), and by decreasing the cellular carbon density. There is thus potential for high vacuolation and high sedimentation rates in diatoms to significantly decrease &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; and increase species competitive advantage. Our results also suggest that &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; for larger non-diatom protists may be constrained by rates of nutrient transport. For a given carbon density, cell size and &lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt;, the value of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;/K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; remains constant. This implies that species or strains with a lower &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; might coincidentally have a competitive advantage under nutrient limited conditions as they also express lower values of &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;. The ability of cells to modulate the &lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt; according to their nutritional status, and hence change the instantaneous maximum transport rate, has a very marked effect upon transport and growth kinetics. Analyses and dynamic models that do not consider such modulation will inevitably fail to properly reflect competitive advantage in nutrient acquisition. This has important implications for the accurate representation and predictive capabilities of model applications, in particular in a changing environment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CoNucHdd8IM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>2</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16308310122:44e8d:ed160cc3</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin J.

A group at Merck (Boston) reports a combination of very small-scale automated synthesis with a screening assay in situ (no purification). You may be wondering how that works, or how it can possibly work, especially when you hear that the nanoscale reactions are transition-metal catalyzed. After all, we usually spend a good deal of effort trying to make sure that our assay candidates are cleaned up and (most especially) free of metal contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is the type of protein assay. It’s not a functional readout, which is where the metals can give you all sorts of false positives, but rather just a binding assay, done by mass spec. That’s generally done in an is-anything-there binary mode, but in this paper, they’re actually titrating in the amount of protein to get a rough order of affinities. Still, one strike against that sort of detection has always been “But you’re only measuring binding, not real inhibition, etc.” That’s still true, but now you can always consider going the targeted protein degradation route, in which case all you need is some sort of binder. As mentioned here in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/26/dna-libraries-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;another recent post&lt;/a&gt;, the same consideration applies to DNA-encoded libraries, which also just give you a binding affinity readout – the Merck authors don’t mention this aspect, but it’s a real consideration these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, they did a test with 20 reactions each using amide formation, Suzuki couplings, and Buchwald-Hartwig C-N couplings (which certainly cover a lot of real-world medicinal chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/24/boring-or-the-medicinal-chemists-toolkit&quot;&gt;for better or worse&lt;/a&gt;).  They used the small-scale reaction setup to screen conditions for the latter two, in a smaller-scale version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. In each case, they also synthesized the products on a 20mg scale and purified them by traditional means, in order to compare them with the nanoscale assay results. (These all produced compounds in known kinase inhibitor space, which I’m afraid is also pretty realistic.) And the correlation was strong: the affinity-mass-spec assay could indeed pick out the potent compounds (as it should) without giving false positives along the way (since you’re looking for the particular mass signature of the product associated with the enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this confirmation in hand, the group then took one of the intermediates and coupled it in each individual well of a 384 plate after an automated reaction conditions screen. They got 345 products and rank-ordered them by titrating in CHK1 protein, with a mass spec readout each time, and identified three new potent binders. These reactions are done on about 0.05mg of material each, so you can plow through quite a few of them without plowing through a lot of starting material, and generate a lot of SAR data rather quickly. The reaction screening is a key part of the process – taking robust but generic coupling conditions across that same 384 set only gave 158 products (and thus missed several nanomolar inhibitors). Overall, to optimize the 384 set and assay them took 3114 reactions, consuming about 120mg of the starting material. You are not going to be able to do that by hand. I don’t care how much of a machine you are in the lab, you’re not more of a machine than a machine is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors note, machine-learning algorithms may eventually make it easier to navigate both reaction condition space and SAR space, but for now, we really have to attack these things empirically, and this (in general) seems like the way to do it. Small scale, highly automated, optimized, high-throughput: you’re not going to be able to sort things so thoroughly any other way. And since we often have to resort to brute force, we should be letting the machines take that on whenever possible, because brute force is exactly what they do the best. That was proven on the high-throughput screening end of the business many years ago, and it’s true on the compound synthesis end of things, too. Bring ’em on.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011–2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim. Bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to yield odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were a total of 612 IFH claims made in the ED from 2011–2013. The demographic characteristics, acuity of presentation and discharge diagnoses were similar during both the before and after periods. Overall, 28.6% fewer claims were made under the IFH program after the cuts. Of the claims made, significantly more were rejected after the cuts than before (13.7% after vs. 3.9% before, adjusted OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.18–8.40; p&amp;lt;0.05). The majority (75.0%) of rejected claims have not been paid by patients. Fewer patients after the cuts indicated that they had a family physician (20.4% after vs. 30% before, unadjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14–2.44; p&amp;lt;0.05) yet a higher proportion of patients without a family physician were still advised to follow up with their family doctor during the after period (67.2% after vs. 41.8% before, unadjusted OR 2.85, 95% CI: 1.45–5.62; p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of both rejected and subsequently unpaid claims after the IFH cuts in June 2012, as demonstrated in the logistic regression analysis in this health records review, represents a potential barrier to emergency medical care, as well as a new financial burden to be shouldered by patients and hospitals. A reduction in IFH claims in the ED and a reduction in the number of patients with access to a family physician also suggests inadequate primary care for this population, yet this was not reflected in the follow-up advice offered by ED physicians to patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197282</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0e8:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francis Bakewell, Sarah Addleman, Garth Dickinson, Venkatesh Thiruganasambandamoorthy&lt;/p&gt;

This has led to numerous studies providing results of segmentation of chromosome sequences of different species into so called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). As the number of such studies grows steadily and many of them make claims about the perceived differences between TAD structures observed in different conditions, there is a growing need for good measures of similarity (or dissimilarity) between such segmentations. We provide here a BP score, which is a relatively simple distance metric based on the bipartite matching between two segmentations. In this paper, we provide the rationale behind choosing specifically this function and show its results on several different datasets, both simulated and experimental. We show that not only the BP score is a proper metric satisfying the triangle inequality, but that it is providing good granularity of scores for typical situations occuring between different TAD segmentations. We also introduce local variant of the BP metric and show that in actual comparisons between experimental datasets, the local BP score is correlating with the observed changes in gene expression and genome methylation. In summary, we consider the BP score a good foundation for analysing the dynamics of chromosome structures. The methodology we present in this work could be used by many researchers in their ongoing analyses making it a popular and useful tool.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/307330v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162ff14b3a9:7dd720:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Studying the 3D structure of chromosomes is an emerging field flourishing in recent years because of rapid development of experimental approaches for studying chromosomal contacts.

CRISPR-Cas9 technology is routinely applied for targeted mutagenesis in model organisms and cell lines. Recent studies indicate that the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas9 system is affected by eukaryotic chromatin structures. Here, we show that the likelihood of successful mutagenesis correlates with transcript levels during early development in zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) embryos. In an experimental setting, we found that guide RNAs differ in their onset of mutagenesis activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, some guide RNAs with high &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; activity possessed poor mutagenesis activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting the presence of factors that limit the mutagenesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using open access datasets generated from early developmental stages of the zebrafish, and guide RNAs selected from the CRISPRz database, we provide further evidence for an association between gene expression during early development and the success of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis in zebrafish embryos. In order to further inspect the effect of chromatin on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, we analysed the relationship of selected chromatin features on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis efficiency using publicly available data from zebrafish embryos. We found a correlation between chromatin openness and the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. These results indicate that CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis is influenced by chromatin accessibility in zebrafish embryos.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196238</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb9d:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Meri I.

Sexual transmission is the principal driver of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic. Understanding HIV vaccine-induced immune responses at mucosal surfaces can generate hypotheses regarding mechanisms of protection, and may influence vaccine development. The RV144 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00223080) efficacy trial showed protection against HIV infections but mucosal samples were not collected, therefore, the contribution of mucosal antibodies to preventing HIV-1 acquisition is unknown. Here, we report the generation, magnitude and persistence of antibody responses to recombinant gp120 envelope and antigens including variable one and two loop scaffold antigens (gp70V1V2) previously shown to correlate with risk in RV144. We evaluated antibody responses to gp120 A244gD and gp70V1V2 92TH023 (both CRF01_AE) and Case A2 (subtype B) in cervico-vaginal mucus (CVM), seminal plasma (SP) and rectal secretions (RS) from HIV-uninfected RV144 vaccine recipients, who were randomized to receive two late boosts of ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E, AIDSVAX®B/E, or ALVAC-HIV alone at 0 and 6 months. Late vaccine boosting increased IgG geometric mean titers (GMT) to gp120 A244gD in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM (28 and 17 fold, respectively), followed by SP and RS. IgG to gp70V1V2 92TH023 increased in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM (11–17 fold) and SP (2 fold) two weeks post first boost. IgG to Case A2 was only detected in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM. Mucosal IgG to gp120 A244gD (CVM, SP, RS), gp70V1V2 92TH023 (CVM, SP), and Case A2 (CVM) correlated with plasma IgG levels (p&amp;lt;0.001). Although the magnitude of IgG responses declined after boosting, anti-gp120 A244gD IgG responses in CVM persisted for 12 months post final vaccination. Further studies in localization, persistence and magnitude of envelope specific antibodies (IgG and dimeric IgA) in anogenital secretions will help determine their role in preventing mucosal HIV acquisition.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196397</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d748:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Siriwat Akapirat, Chitraporn Karnasuta, Sandhya Vasan, Supachai Rerks-Ngarm, Punnee Pitisuttithum, Sirinan Madnote, Hathairat Savadsuk, Surawach Rittiroongrad, Jiraporn Puangkaew, Sanjay Phogat, James Tartaglia, Faruk Sinangil, Mark S. de Souza, Jean-Louis Excler, Jerome H.

Sexual transmission is the principal driver of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic. Understanding HIV vaccine-induced immune responses at mucosal surfaces can generate hypotheses regarding mechanisms of protection, and may influence vaccine development. The RV144 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00223080) efficacy trial showed protection against HIV infections but mucosal samples were not collected, therefore, the contribution of mucosal antibodies to preventing HIV-1 acquisition is unknown. Here, we report the generation, magnitude and persistence of antibody responses to recombinant gp120 envelope and antigens including variable one and two loop scaffold antigens (gp70V1V2) previously shown to correlate with risk in RV144. We evaluated antibody responses to gp120 A244gD and gp70V1V2 92TH023 (both CRF01_AE) and Case A2 (subtype B) in cervico-vaginal mucus (CVM), seminal plasma (SP) and rectal secretions (RS) from HIV-uninfected RV144 vaccine recipients, who were randomized to receive two late boosts of ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E, AIDSVAX®B/E, or ALVAC-HIV alone at 0 and 6 months.

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. The long-lasting desynchronizing impact of CR stimulation has been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. However, as yet it is unclear how to optimally choose the CR stimulation frequency, i.e. the repetition rate at which the CR stimuli are delivered. This work presents the first computational study on the dependence of the acute and long-term outcome on the CR stimulation frequency in neuronal networks with STDP. For this purpose, CR stimulation was applied with Rapidly Varying Sequences (RVS) as well as with Slowly Varying Sequences (SVS) in a wide range of stimulation frequencies and intensities. Our findings demonstrate that acute desynchronization, achieved during stimulation, does not necessarily lead to long-term desynchronization after cessation of stimulation. By comparing the long-term effects of the two different CR protocols, the RVS CR stimulation turned out to be more robust against variations of the stimulation frequency. However, SVS CR stimulation can obtain stronger anti-kindling effects. We revealed specific parameter ranges that are favorable for long-term desynchronization. For instance, RVS CR stimulation at weak intensities and with stimulation frequencies in the range of the neuronal firing rates turned out to be effective and robust, in particular, if no closed loop adaptation of stimulation parameters is (technically) available. From a clinical standpoint, this may be relevant in the context of both invasive as well as non-invasive CR stimulation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rx9Yjw7JXhk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>3</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1634b3364f4:491e3b:abeb7260</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thanos Manos, Magteld Zeitler, Peter A.

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Sarcopenic obesity is a risk factor of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to generate a predictive score of sarcopenia occurrence one year after bariatric surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Patients and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted an observational prospective cohort study on a total of 184 severely obese patients admitted to our institution to undergo sleeve gastrectomy. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebrae (SMA, cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was measured from the routinely performed computed tomography. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as follows: SMA/height&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI &amp;lt; 38.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for women and &amp;lt; 52.4 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for men. Measurements were performed at surgery and one year later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Most of the included patients were female (79%), with a mean age of 42±0.9 years and body mass index of 43.2±0.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Fifteen patients (8%) had sarcopenia before surgery and 59 (32%) at the one-year follow-up. Male gender (p&amp;lt;0.0001), SMA before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001), and SMI before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001) significantly correlated with the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after surgery by multivariate analysis. Two predictive sarcopenia occurrence scores were constructed using SMA and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt;) or SMI and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt;). The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; was significantly greater than that of the &lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt; for the diagnosis of postoperative sarcopenia occurrence (0.95±0.02 &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 0.90±0.02; p&amp;lt;0.01). A cut-off value for the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; of 0.53 had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 95%. In the group of patients without baseline sarcopenia, the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; had still an excellent AUROC of 0.92±0.02. A cut-off of 0.55 predicted development of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy in these patients with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 88%, and negative predictive value of 95%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; has excellent predictive value for the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy. This score can be used to target early intensification of nutritional and dietetic follow-up to the predicted high-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197248</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219c:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cosmin Sebastian Voican, Amandine Lebrun, Sophie Maitre, Panagiotis Lainas, Karima Lamouri, Micheline Njike-Nakseu, Martin Gaillard, Hadrien Tranchart, Axel Balian, Ibrahim Dagher, Gabriel Perlemuter, Sylvie Naveau&lt;/p&gt;

The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as follows: SMA/height&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI &amp;lt; 38.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for women and &amp;lt; 52.4 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for men. Measurements were performed at surgery and one year later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Most of the included patients were female (79%), with a mean age of 42±0.9 years and body mass index of 43.2±0.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Fifteen patients (8%) had sarcopenia before surgery and 59 (32%) at the one-year follow-up. Male gender (p&amp;lt;0.0001), SMA before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001), and SMI before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001) significantly correlated with the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after surgery by multivariate analysis. Two predictive sarcopenia occurrence scores were constructed using SMA and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt;) or SMI and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt;). The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; was significantly greater than that of the &lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt; for the diagnosis of postoperative sarcopenia occurrence (0.95±0.02 &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 0.90±0.02; p&amp;lt;0.01). A cut-off value for the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; of 0.53 had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 95%. In the group of patients without baseline sarcopenia, the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; had still an excellent AUROC of 0.92±0.02. A cut-off of 0.55 predicted development of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy in these patients with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 88%, and negative predictive value of 95%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; has excellent predictive value for the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy. This score can be used to target early intensification of nutritional and dietetic follow-up to the predicted high-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196773</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196773</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Mia Liljeström</name></author><published>1525294800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Large-scale functional networks connect differently for processing words and symbol strings</title><updated>1525294800000</updated><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><fingerprint>a29de002</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196773</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mia Liljeström, Johanna Vartiainen, Jan Kujala, Riitta Salmelin&lt;/p&gt;
Reconfigurations of synchronized large-scale networks are thought to be central neural mechanisms that support cognition and behavior in the human brain. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings together with recent advances in network analysis now allow for sub-second snapshots of such networks. In the present study, we compared frequency-resolved functional connectivity patterns underlying reading of single words and visual recognition of symbol strings. Word reading emphasized coherence in a left-lateralized network with nodes in classical perisylvian language regions, whereas symbol processing recruited a bilateral network, including connections between frontal and parietal regions previously associated with spatial attention and visual working memory. Our results illustrate the flexible nature of functional networks, whereby processing of different form categories, written words vs. symbol strings, leads to the formation of large-scale functional networks that operate at distinct oscillatory frequencies and incorporate task-relevant regions. These results suggest that category-specific processing should be viewed not so much as a local process but as a distributed neural process implemented in signature networks. For words, increased coherence was detected particularly in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and high gamma (60–90 Hz) frequency bands, whereas increased coherence for symbol strings was observed in the high beta (21–29 Hz) and low gamma (30–45 Hz) frequency range. These findings attest to the role of coherence in specific frequency bands as a general mechanism for integrating stimulus-dependent information across brain regions.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196773</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a190:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mia Liljeström, Johanna Vartiainen, Jan Kujala, Riitta Salmelin&lt;/p&gt;

Using publicly available flow cytometry and mass cytometry datasets we demonstrate that this method (termed CytoBinning), recapitulates the results of traditional manual cytometric analyses and leads to new and testable hypotheses.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04854-2</link><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04854-2/d41586-018-04854-2_15708994.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>Quirin Schiermeier</name></author><published>1524207600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Clear signs of global warming will hit poorer countries first</title><crawled>1524244258405</crawled><fingerprint>870b6608</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04854-2</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clear signs of global warming will hit poorer countries first&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear signs of global warming will hit poorer countries first, Published online: 20 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04854-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04854-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;New climate-inequality tool quantifies how quickly the weather will veer beyond normal in different regions.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04854-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162e4099e65:4cab0c7:34f43e70</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clear signs of global warming will hit poorer countries first&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear signs of global warming will hit poorer countries first, Published online: 20 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04854-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04854-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;New climate-inequality tool quantifies how quickly the weather will veer beyond normal in different regions.</content></content><engagement>465</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197172</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197172</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Mari A.

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF &lt;i&gt;OCT4&lt;/i&gt;, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and to endodermal tumor formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197046</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f71:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rangarajan Sambathkumar, Renate Akkerman, Sumitava Dastidar, Philip Roelandt, Manoj Kumar, Manmohan Bajaj, Ana Rita Mestre Rosa, Nicky Helsen, Veerle Vanslembrouck, Eric Kalo, Satish Khurana, Jos Laureys, Conny Gysemans, Marijke M.

It is expected that cell replacement therapies using autologous cells would forego the need for immunosuppression, otherwise required in allogeneic transplantations. However, recent studies have shown the unexpected immune rejection of undifferentiated autologous mouse iPSCs after transplantation. Whether similar immunogenic properties are maintained in iPSC-derived lineage-committed cells (such as neural precursors) is relatively unknown.

It is expected that cell replacement therapies using autologous cells would forego the need for immunosuppression, otherwise required in allogeneic transplantations. However, recent studies have shown the unexpected immune rejection of undifferentiated autologous mouse iPSCs after transplantation. Whether similar immunogenic properties are maintained in iPSC-derived lineage-committed cells (such as neural precursors) is relatively unknown.

E487K point mutation of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2 (ALDH2*2) in East Asians intrinsically lowers ALDH2 activity. ALDH2*2 is associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetic patients exhibit heart failure of preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) i.e. while the systolic heart function is preserved in them, they may exhibit diastolic dysfunction, implying a jeopardized myocardial health. Currently, it is challenging to detect cardiac functional deterioration in diabetic mice. Stress echocardiography (echo) in the clinical set-up is a procedure used to measure cardiac reserve and impaired cardiac function in coronary artery diseases. Therefore, we hypothesized that high-fat diet fed type-2 diabetic ALDH2*2 mutant mice exhibit HFpEF which can be measured by cardiac echo stress test methodology. We induced type-2 diabetes in 12-week-old male C57BL/6 and ALDH2*2 mice through a high-fat diet. At the end of 4 months of DM induction, we measured the cardiac function in diabetic and control mice of C57BL/6 and ALDH2*2 genotypes by conscious echo. Subsequently, we imposed exercise stress by allowing the mice to run on the treadmill until exhaustion. Post-stress, we measured their cardiac function again. Only after treadmill running, but not at rest, we found a significant decrease in % fractional shortening and % ejection fraction in ALDH2*2 mice with diabetes compared to C57BL/6 diabetic mice as well as non-diabetic (control) ALDH2*2 mice. The diabetic ALDH2*2 mice also exhibited poor maximal running speed and distance. Our data suggest that high-fat fed diabetic ALDH2*2 mice exhibit HFpEF and treadmill exercise stress echo test is able to determine this HFpEF in the diabetic ALDH2*2 mice.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195796</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f9:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guodong Pan, Srikar Munukutla, Ananya Kar, Joseph Gardinier, Rajarajan A.

Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-protein complexes in a number of bacterial pathogens that can translocate proteins and DNA to the host. Most T4SSs function in conjugation and translocate DNA; however, approximately 13% function to secrete proteins, delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. Upon entry, these effectors manipulate the host cell’s machinery for their own benefit, which can result in serious illness or death of the host. For this reason recognition of T4SS effectors has become an important subject. Much previous work has focused on verifying effectors experimentally, a costly endeavor in terms of money, time, and effort. Having good predictions for effectors will help to focus experimental validations and decrease testing costs. In recent years, several scoring and machine learning-based methods have been suggested for the purpose of predicting T4SS effector proteins. These methods have used different sets of features for prediction, and their predictions have been inconsistent. In this paper, an optimal set of features is presented for predicting T4SS effector proteins using a statistical approach. A thorough literature search was performed to find features that have been proposed. Feature values were calculated for datasets of known effectors and non-effectors for T4SS-containing pathogens for four genera with a sufficient number of known effectors, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp, and &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. The features were ranked, and less important features were filtered out. Correlations between remaining features were removed, and dimensional reduction was accomplished using principal component analysis and factor analysis. Finally, the optimal features for each pathogen were chosen by building logistic regression models and evaluating each model. The results based on evaluation of our logistic regression models confirm the effectiveness of our four optimal sets of features, and based on these an optimal set of features is proposed for all T4SS effector proteins.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bedc:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhila Esna Ashari, Nairanjana Dasgupta, Kelly A.

The Gouy-Chapman model predicts that adsorption of charged ligands to surface proteins must produce displacement currents and related apparent changes in membrane capacitance. Here we verified these predictions with SERT. Our observations demonstrate that ligand binding to a protein can be monitored in real time and in a label-free manner by recording the membrane capacitance.</description><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4473.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4473</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/19/E4473/F3.medium.gif</url><height>309</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width></visual><author><name>John K.

Systematics is considered important for effective toothbrushing. A theoretical concept of systematics in toothbrushing and a validated index to quantify it using observational data is suggested. The index consists of three components: completeness (all areas of the dentition reached), isochronicity (all areas brushed equally long) and consistency (avoiding frequent alternations between areas). Toothbrushing should take a sufficient length of time; therefore, this parameter is part of the index value calculation. Quantitative data from video observations were used including the number of changes between areas, number of areas reached, absolute brushing time and brushing time per area. These data were fed into two algorithms that converted the behaviour into two index values (each with values between 0 and 1) and were summed as the Toothbrushing Systematics Index (TSI) value; 0 indicates completely unsystematic and 2 indicates perfectly systematic brushing. The index was developed using theoretical data. The data matrices revealed the highest values when all areas are reached and brushed equally long. Few changes occurred between the areas when the brushing duration was ≥90 s; the lowest values occurred under opposite conditions. Clinical applicability was tested with data from re-analysed videos from an earlier intervention study aiming to establish a pre-defined toothbrushing sequence. Subjects who fully adopted this sequence had a baseline TSI of 1.30±0.26, which increased to 1.74±0.09 after the intervention (p≤0.001). When the participants who only partially adopted the sequence were included, the respective values were 1.25±0.27 and 1.69±0.14 (p≤0.001). The suggested new TS-index can cover a variety of clinically meaningful variations of systematic brushing, validly quantifies the changes in toothbrushing systematics and has discriminative power.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196497</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4b:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nadine Schlueter, Katrin Winterfeld, Vicenç Quera, Tobias Winterfeld, Carolina Ganss&lt;/p&gt;

Our cryo-EM structures show how F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; are coupled, give insight into the proton translocation pathway, and show how oligomycin blocks ATP synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006117</link><recrawled>1524084125569</recrawled><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rbi3PORvpr0/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Nicola De Maio</name></author><published>1524085200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Bayesian reconstruction of transmission within outbreaks using genomic variants</title><updated>1524085200000</updated><crawled>1524074503865</crawled><fingerprint>fa021ec3</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006117</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicola De Maio, Colin J.

Pathogen genome sequencing can reveal details of transmission histories and is a powerful tool in the fight against infectious disease. In particular, within-host pathogen genomic variants identified through heterozygous nucleotide base calls are a potential source of information to identify linked cases and infer direction and time of transmission. However, using such data effectively to model disease transmission presents a number of challenges, including differentiating genuine variants from those observed due to sequencing error, as well as the specification of a realistic model for within-host pathogen population dynamics. Here we propose a new Bayesian approach to transmission inference, BadTrIP (BAyesian epiDemiological TRansmission Inference from Polymorphisms), that explicitly models evolution of pathogen populations in an outbreak, transmission (including transmission bottlenecks), and sequencing error. BadTrIP enables the inference of host-to-host transmission from pathogen sequencing data and epidemiological data. By assuming that genomic variants are unlinked, our method does not require the computationally intensive and unreliable reconstruction of individual haplotypes. Using simulations we show that BadTrIP is robust in most scenarios and can accurately infer transmission events by efficiently combining information from genetic and epidemiological sources; thanks to its realistic model of pathogen evolution and the inclusion of epidemiological data, BadTrIP is also more accurate than existing approaches. BadTrIP is distributed as an open source package (https://bitbucket.org/nicofmay/badtrip) for the phylogenetic software BEAST2. We apply our method to reconstruct transmission history at the early stages of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, showcasing the power of within-host genomic variants to reconstruct transmission events.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rbi3PORvpr0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162d9eb5eb9:b6ef0:a077e55f</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicola De Maio, Colin J.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work in this paper on the synthetic procedures, both to prepare these compounds and to investigate their chemistry. What it tells you is that (as you would have figured) that C-to-Si is a nontrivial switch in the fume hood, because the chemistries involved can be quite different. For instance, that first core on the list does N-alkylation and N-acylation reactions just fine, but when you try to do metal-catalyzed N-C couplings on it, things go to pieces (protodesilylation and other decomposition reactions). Protodesilylation in general was something that had to be looked out for, with attention paid to solvent choice and temperature in the reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme that comes up several times is that the nitrogens, when exposed to base, can be significantly more prone to oxidative side reactions than expected (even fairly simple reductive amination reactions had to be performed under inert atmosphere, although they were successful then). Metalation reactions were also tricky. Some of them worked just fine and reacted as expected with a range of electrophiles, while others would work with some partners but not others. But some of them just fell apart immediately on attempts to form the anions (such as C2 of the second compound on the list shown), and the only way to find that out was to try them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the group was able to prepare an impressive range of functionalized derivatives of these cores, almost all of which are shots into unknown territory. How, then, do such compounds behave? Their cLogP values are almost invariably higher than their carbon analogs, but as usual when you move into unusual structure space, it would be interesting to have some experimental values to make sure that that some of this just isn’t a problem with the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the Si and C matched pairs in assays, there seems to be no difference in P-gp transporter behavior &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, for starters. There was a slight trend towards more instability against CYP enzymes, but this wasn’t universal (and was also species-dependent, with the rat enzymes being more vigorous. (That’s often the case; rats have a reputation for having more strongly oxidizing liver enzymes, which I’ve always attributed to their rather broad definitions of suitable food). Inhibition of these enzymes didn’t show much of a trend one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second compound on the list above and its carbon analog were compared in rat PK experiments as well (oral and i.v.) Intravenous behavior was fairly similar – the Si compound had slightly higher clearance and slightly higher volume of distribution. As for p.o. dosing, the Si compound is significantly more bioavailable, although it has a lower Cmax. Overall AUC was pretty much the same, though. And even though it had greater instability to the rat enzymes, it had a twofold great half-life&lt;em&gt; in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, which makes you think plasma protein binding. So this is only one point, but taken with the other Si compounds in the literature, it seems as if they fall inside the normal range of variation that you see with all-carbon compounds – there’s nothing intrinsically weird about them from a pharmacokinetic/metabolic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up what I mentioned in my past last year, though: perhaps it would be better for silicon-containing drugs if there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; something unusual about them. Admittedly, that could also be “unusually bad”, but overall, it’s harder to make the case for moving to silicon if the effects of doing so are (a) not huge and (b) not all that predictable. You’re already in that zone with carbon analogs, most likely, so why bother? The paper itself has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This lack of success in the pharmaceutical industry may be attributed to two key factors: (1) an absence of general and accessible synthetic methods for the construction of appropriately functionalized silicon-containing molecules and (2) ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon, of which the “carbon/silicon switch” is the most common. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that second point is what we’re talking about. “Ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon”, from another angle, means “lack of a good reason to use it at all”. If some effective uses for it can be found – and they may well be out there, who knows? – then things will change. But not until then. If the late-stage silicon switch doesn’t necessarily get you anything, it’s true that you’re going to have to look earlier (good activity in a silicon-containing compound that isn’t replicated by its carbon analog), and this work is an attempt to provide a host of new Si-containing chemical matter towards that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would go a long way to answering the overall question would be if someone were to produce a library of (say) ten or twenty thousand diverse silicon-containing drug-like structures and their exact carbon analogs, and do some high-throughput screening campaigns (variously targeted, cellular, and phenotypic) to see how they behave. But no one’s going to go to that trouble just yet, for just the reasons described (an absence of ways to make such things and an absence of compelling reasons to make them). The chicken and egg question remains.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05199-6</link><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05199-6/d41586-018-05199-6_15771652.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>Holly Else</name></author><published>1526626800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>UK’s powerful funding body takes shape</title><crawled>1526651140034</crawled><fingerprint>8653729f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05199-6</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UK’s powerful funding body takes shape&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK’s powerful funding body takes shape, Published online: 18 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05199-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05199-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Organization that brings together all public research agencies outlines its plans.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05199-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163737fb7c2:53362f9:2835af05</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UK’s powerful funding body takes shape&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK’s powerful funding body takes shape, Published online: 18 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05199-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05199-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Organization that brings together all public research agencies outlines its plans.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00132</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jcisd8/~3/u9iMQUF6F8E/acs.jcim.8b00132</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Fang-Yu Lin, Pedro E.

During this process cells undergo major changes in their transcriptional programs to accommodate new cellular functions. We found that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying these changes are functionally connected and jointly control genes involved in cell adhesion, a key process in epidermal maintenance. Using siRNA-based perturbation screens, we identified novel DNA/RNA binding regulators of epidermal differentiation. Computational modeling and experimental validation identified functional interactions between the matrin-type 2 zinc-finger protein ZMAT2 and the epigenetic modifiers ING5, SMARCA5, BRD1, UHRF1, BPTF, SMARCC2. ZMAT2 is required to keep cells in an undifferentiated, proliferative state and quantitative proteomics identified ZMAT2 as an interactor of the pre-spliceosome.

During this process cells undergo major changes in their transcriptional programs to accommodate new cellular functions. We found that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying these changes are functionally connected and jointly control genes involved in cell adhesion, a key process in epidermal maintenance. Using siRNA-based perturbation screens, we identified novel DNA/RNA binding regulators of epidermal differentiation. Computational modeling and experimental validation identified functional interactions between the matrin-type 2 zinc-finger protein ZMAT2 and the epigenetic modifiers ING5, SMARCA5, BRD1, UHRF1, BPTF, SMARCC2. ZMAT2 is required to keep cells in an undifferentiated, proliferative state and quantitative proteomics identified ZMAT2 as an interactor of the pre-spliceosome. RNA-Immunoprecipitation and transcriptome-wide RNA splicing analysis showed that ZMAT2 associates with and regulates transcripts involved in cell adhesion in conjuction with ING5. Thus, joint control by post-transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms is important to maintain epidermal cells in an undifferentiated state.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00078</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/RYhUrjX24tY/acs.biochem.8b00078</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jaka Socan, Masoud Kazemi, Geir Villy Isaksen, Bjørn Olav Brandsdal, Johan Åqvist</name></author><published>1525924800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00078/20180509/images/medium/bi-2018-00078v_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00078&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;In previous work we have developed a fast sequence that focusses on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) based on the long T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of CSF. By processing the data obtained with this CSF MRI sequence, brain parenchymal volume (BPV) and intracranial volume (ICV) can be automatically obtained. The aim of this study was to assess the precision of the BPV and ICV measurements of the CSF MRI sequence and to validate the CSF MRI sequence by comparison with 3D T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-based brain segmentation methods.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Ten healthy volunteers (2 females; median age 28 years) were scanned (3T MRI) twice with repositioning in between. The scan protocol consisted of a low resolution (LR) CSF sequence (0:57min), a high resolution (HR) CSF sequence (3:21min) and a 3D T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequence (6:47min). Data of the HR 3D-T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted images were downsampled to obtain LR T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted images (reconstructed imaging time: 1:59 min). Data of the CSF MRI sequences was automatically segmented using in-house software. The 3D T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted images were segmented using FSL (5.0), SPM12 and FreeSurfer (5.3.0).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean absolute differences for BPV and ICV between the first and second scan for CSF LR (BPV/ICV: 12±9/7±4cc) and CSF HR (5±5/4±2cc) were comparable to FSL HR (9±11/19±23cc), FSL LR (7±4, 6±5cc), FreeSurfer HR (5±3/14±8cc), FreeSurfer LR (9±8, 12±10cc), and SPM HR (5±3/4±7cc), and SPM LR (5±4, 5±3cc). The correlation between the measured volumes of the CSF sequences and that measured by FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM HR and LR was very good (all Pearson’s correlation coefficients &gt;0.83, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; .67–.97). The results from the downsampled data and the high-resolution data were similar.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Both CSF MRI sequences have a precision comparable to, and a very good correlation with established 3D T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-based automated segmentations methods for the segmentation of BPV and ICV.

State-of-the-art yeast genetic interaction mapping, which relies on robotic manipulation of arrays of double mutant strains, does not scale readily to multi-condition studies. Here we describe Barcode Fusion Genetics to map Genetic Interactions (BFG-GI), by which double mutant strains generated via en masse party mating can also be monitored en masse for growth and genetic interactions. By using site-specific recombination to fuse two DNA barcodes, each representing a specific gene deletion, BFG-GI enables multiplexed quantitative tracking of double mutants via next-generation sequencing. We applied BFG-GI to a matrix of DNA repair genes under nine different conditions, including methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO), bleomycin, zeocin, and three other DNA-damaging environments.

State-of-the-art yeast genetic interaction mapping, which relies on robotic manipulation of arrays of double mutant strains, does not scale readily to multi-condition studies. Here we describe Barcode Fusion Genetics to map Genetic Interactions (BFG-GI), by which double mutant strains generated via en masse party mating can also be monitored en masse for growth and genetic interactions. By using site-specific recombination to fuse two DNA barcodes, each representing a specific gene deletion, BFG-GI enables multiplexed quantitative tracking of double mutants via next-generation sequencing. We applied BFG-GI to a matrix of DNA repair genes under nine different conditions, including methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO), bleomycin, zeocin, and three other DNA-damaging environments. BFG-GI recapitulated known genetic interactions and yielded new condition-dependent genetic interactions. We validated and further explored a subnetwork of condition-dependent genetic interactions involving MAG1, SLX4, and genes encoding the Shu complex, and inferred that loss of the Shu complex leads to a decrease in the activation or activity of the checkpoint protein kinase Rad53.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24484-y</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/_svnDge_za0/s41598-018-24484-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ritsuko Harigai</name></author><published>1523948400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Tranilast inhibits the expression of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in neurofibromin-deficient cells</title><crawled>1523956924782</crawled><fingerprint>1565ec4f</fingerprint><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24484-y</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tranilast inhibits the expression of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in neurofibromin-deficient cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tranilast inhibits the expression of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in neurofibromin-deficient cells, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24484-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24484-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Tranilast inhibits the expression of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in neurofibromin-deficient cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/_svnDge_za0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24484-y/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24484_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>499</width></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162d2e9416e:304f585:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tranilast inhibits the expression of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in neurofibromin-deficient cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tranilast inhibits the expression of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in neurofibromin-deficient cells, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24484-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24484-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Tranilast inhibits the expression of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in neurofibromin-deficient cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/_svnDge_za0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24484-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197254</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197254</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Estrella Rubio-Solsona</name></author><published>1526331600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>ANKK1 is found in myogenic precursors and muscle fibers subtypes with glycolytic metabolism</title><updated>1526331600000</updated><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><fingerprint>bbed16e3</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197254</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Estrella Rubio-Solsona, Salvador Martí, Juan J.

Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (&lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been widely related to neuropsychiatry disorders. The localization of ANKK1 in neural progenitors and its correlation with the cell cycle has suggested its participation in development. However, ANKK1 functions still need to be identified. Here, we have further characterized the ANKK1 localization &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, by using immunolabeling, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in the myogenic lineage. Histologic investigations in mice and humans revealed that ANKK1 is expressed in precursors of embryonic and adult muscles. In mice embryos, ANKK1 was found in migrating myotubes where it shows a polarized cytoplasmic distribution, while proliferative myoblasts and satellite cells show different isoforms in their nuclei and cytoplasm. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of ANKK1 protein isoforms along the myogenic progression showed the decline of nuclear ANKK1-kinase until its total exclusion in myotubes. In adult mice, ANKK1 was expressed exclusively in the Fast-Twitch muscles fibers subtype. The induction of glycolytic metabolism in C2C12 cells with high glucose concentration or treatment with berberine caused a significant increase in the &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Similarly, C2C12 cells under hypoxic conditions caused the increase of nuclear ANKK1. These results altogether show a relationship between &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation and the metabolism of muscles during development and in adulthood. Finally, we found ANKK1 expression in regenerative fibers of muscles from dystrophic patients. Future studies in ANKK1 biology and the pathological response of muscles will reveal whether this protein is a novel muscle disease biomarker.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197254</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219e:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Estrella Rubio-Solsona, Salvador Martí, Juan J.

Infants from an early age have a bias to attend more to faces than non-faces and after 5 months are particularly attentive to fearful faces. We examined the specificity of this “fear bias” in 5-, 7-, and 12-month-old infants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 269) and 36-month-old children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 191) and whether its development is associated with features of the early rearing environment, specifically maternal anxiety and depression symptoms. Attention dwell times were assessed by measuring the latencies of gaze shifts from a stimulus at fixation to a new stimulus in the visual periphery. In infancy, dwell times were shorter for non-face control stimuli vs. happy faces at all ages, and happy vs. fearful, but not angry, faces at 7 and 12 months. At 36 months, dwell times were shorter for non-faces and happy faces compared to fearful and angry faces. Individual variations in attention dwell times were not associated with mothers’ self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms at either age. The results suggest that sensitivity to fearful faces precedes a more general bias for threat-alerting stimuli in early development. We did not find evidence that the initial manifestation of these biases is related to moderate variations in maternal depression or anxiety symptoms.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197424</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a1c04be:41f7c57:3dd877af</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jukka M.

&lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; is a waterborne parasite that causes diarrheal disease in humans and in cattle. Risk factors for human illness include contact with surface water such as lakes and rivers, exposure to contaminated municipal drinking water, as well as zoonotic transmission from livestock and agriculture. The objectives of this study are twofold: 1) to describe the temporal distribution of cryptosporidiosis in Southwestern Ontario; and 2) to determine the distribution of human cryptosporidiosis, in relation to exposures such as cryptosporidium positive cattle farms, weather events, and hydrological factors. Seasonal trends in 214 bovine and 87 human cases were assessed using regression models that predicted monthly case counts in relation to observed monthly case counts. A case-crossover approach was used to evaluate acute associations between daily environmental exposures, such as weather, hydrology, the presence of &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; positive cattle farms within the region, and the risk of human &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; infection.

&lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; is a waterborne parasite that causes diarrheal disease in humans and in cattle. Risk factors for human illness include contact with surface water such as lakes and rivers, exposure to contaminated municipal drinking water, as well as zoonotic transmission from livestock and agriculture. The objectives of this study are twofold: 1) to describe the temporal distribution of cryptosporidiosis in Southwestern Ontario; and 2) to determine the distribution of human cryptosporidiosis, in relation to exposures such as cryptosporidium positive cattle farms, weather events, and hydrological factors. Seasonal trends in 214 bovine and 87 human cases were assessed using regression models that predicted monthly case counts in relation to observed monthly case counts. A case-crossover approach was used to evaluate acute associations between daily environmental exposures, such as weather, hydrology, the presence of &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; positive cattle farms within the region, and the risk of human &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; infection. Annual seasonality was found for both human cases and bovine cases with human cases peaking in mid-summer and bovine cases peaking in late winter to early spring. Bovine cases that occurred 21 days prior to human cases were associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of human case occurrence. At both 9 and 14 days prior to human case onset, the odds of a human case increased twofold per 10-degree Celsius increase in air temperature. These results provide a preliminary hypothesis for the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis from cattle to humans via the environment and suggest that the timing of environmental conditions in relation to case occurrence is biologically plausible.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4725.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4725</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/18/4725/F2.medium.gif</url><height>209</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width></visual><author><name>Anna Buchman, John M.

Recognition of the functional sites of genes is also a fundamental step in gene structure predictions in the most powerful programs.

The leukocyte chemosensory pathway detects attractant gradients and directs cell migration to sites of inflammation, infection, tissue damage, and carcinogenesis. Previous studies have revealed that local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signals at the leading edge of polarized leukocytes play central roles in positive feedback loop essential to cell polarization and chemotaxis. These prior studies showed that stimulation of the leading edge Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal can strongly activate PI3K, thereby triggering a larger PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signal, but did not elucidate the mechanistic link between Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signaling. A hypothesis explaining this link emerged, postulating that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated PKC displaces the MARCKS protein from plasma membrane PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby releasing sequestered PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to serve as the target and substrate lipid of PI3K in PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; single molecule studies of the reconstituted pathway on lipid bilayers demonstrated the feasibility of this PKC-MARCKS-PI3K regulatory module linking Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signals in the reconstituted system. The present study tests the model predictions in live macrophages by quantifying the effects of: (a) two pathway activators—PDGF and ATP that stimulate chemoreceptors and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, respectively; and (b) three pathway inhibitors—wortmannin, EGTA, and Go6976 that inhibit PI3K, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, and PKC, respectively; on (c) four leading edge activity sensors—AKT-PH-mRFP, CKAR, MARCKSp-mRFP, and leading edge area that report on PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; density, PKC activity, MARCKS membrane binding, and leading edge expansion/contraction, respectively. The results provide additional evidence that PKC and PI3K are both essential elements of the leading edge positive feedback loop, and strongly support the existence of a PKC-MARCKS-PI3K regulatory module linking the leading edge Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signals. As predicted, activators stimulate leading edge PKC activity, displacement of MARCKS from the leading edge membrane and increased leading edge PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; levels, while inhibitors trigger the opposite effects. Comparison of the findings for the ameboid chemotaxis of leukocytes with recently published findings for the mesenchymal chemotaxis of fibroblasts suggests that some features of the emerging leukocyte leading edge core pathway (PLC-DAG-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-PKC-MARCKS-PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PI3K-PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) may well be shared by all chemotaxing eukaryotic cells, while other elements of the leukocyte pathway may be specialized features of these highly optimized, professional gradient-seeking cells. More broadly, the findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the strong links between phospho-MARCKS and many human cancers.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196678</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a66:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Brian P.

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can harm the embryonic development and cause life-long consequences in offspring’s health. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of PAE we have used a mouse model of early alcohol exposure, which is based on maternal &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; ingestion of 10% (v/v) ethanol for the first eight days of gestation (GD 0.5–8.5). Owing to the detected postnatal growth-restricted phenotype in the offspring of this mouse model and both prenatal and postnatal growth restriction in alcohol-exposed humans, we focused on imprinted genes &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like growth factor 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Igf2)&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide N&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Paternally expressed gene 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Peg3)&lt;/i&gt;, which all are known to be involved in embryonic and placental growth and development. We studied the effects of alcohol on DNA methylation level at the &lt;i&gt;Igf2/H19&lt;/i&gt; imprinting control region (ICR), &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; differentially methylated region 1, &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; ICR and &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; ICR in 9.5 embryonic days old (E9.5) embryos and placentas by using MassARRAY EpiTYPER. To determine alcohol-induced alterations globally, we also examined methylation in long interspersed nuclear elements (Line-1) in E9.5 placentas. We did not observe any significant alcohol-induced changes in DNA methylation levels. We explored effects of PAE on gene expression of E9.5 embryos as well as E9.5 and E16.5 placentas by using quantitative PCR. The expression of growth promoter gene &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; was decreased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas. The expression of negative growth controller &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt; was significantly increased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos compared to controls, and conversely, a trend of decreased expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas were observed. Furthermore, increased &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos was also detected. Our study indicates that albeit no alterations in the DNA methylation levels of studied sequences were detected by EpiTYPER, early PAE can affect the expression of imprinted genes in both developing embryo and placenta.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b90:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Heidi Marjonen, Mia Toivonen, Laura Lahti, Nina Kaminen-Ahola&lt;/p&gt;

Our main conclusions for interpreting enzyme kinetic results are that the gemdiolate may represent the elusive Michaelis–Menten‐like complex corresponding to the empirical Km (=Kc) with turnover to product via bond scission concerted with stereospecific protonation consistent with the observed catalytic rate. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1636067cc1a:32b4e80:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/xvLfnaEfQRA/s41591-018-0035-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Brooke Tata</name></author><published>1526281200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Elevated prenatal anti-Müllerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood</title><crawled>1526311531793</crawled><fingerprint>955ca763</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevated prenatal anti-Müllerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated prenatal anti-Müllerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0035-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Excess anti-Müllerian hormone during pregnancy results in polycystic ovary syndrome-like phenotypes in female offspring, possibly explaining its pathogenesis as well as suggesting a possible therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/xvLfnaEfQRA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_1635f41b511:3097ffd:93d646dc</id><engagement>600</engagement><engagementRate>13.64</engagementRate><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevated prenatal anti-Müllerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated prenatal anti-Müllerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0035-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Excess anti-Müllerian hormone during pregnancy results in polycystic ovary syndrome-like phenotypes in female offspring, possibly explaining its pathogenesis as well as suggesting a possible therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/xvLfnaEfQRA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00357</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/DLJzIBlGuuc/acs.jmedchem.8b00357</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Joana Reis, Nicola Manzella, Fernando Cagide, Jeanne Mialet-Perez, Eugenio Uriarte, Angelo Parini, Fernanda Borges, Claudia Binda</name></author><published>1524196800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00357/20180420/images/medium/jm-2018-00357m_0012.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00357&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Newcastle disease (ND) causes severe economic loss to poultry industry worldwide. Frequent outbreaks of ND in commercial chickens vaccinated with live vaccines suggest a need to develop improved vaccines that are genetically matched against circulating Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains. In this study, the fusion protein cleavage site (FPCS) sequence of NDV strain Banjarmasin/010 (Banj), a genotype VII NDV, was individually modified using primer mutagenesis to those of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes 2, 7 and 8 and compared with the recombinant Banjarmasin (rBanj) with avirulent NDV LaSota cleavage site (rBanj-LaSota). These FPCS mutations changed the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell-to-cell fusion activity and made rBanj FPCS mutant viruses highly attenuated in chickens. When chickens immunized with the rBanj FPCS mutant viruses and challenged with the virulent Banj, there was reduced challenge virus shedding observed compared to chickens immunized with the heterologous vaccine strain LaSota. Among the genotype VII NDV Banj vaccine candidates, rBanj-LaSota and rBanj containing FPCS of APMV-8 induced highest neutralizing antibody titers and protected chickens with reduced challenge virus shedding. These results show the effect of the F protein cleavage site sequence in generating genotype VII matched NDV vaccines.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197253</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219d:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vinoth K.

Background &lt;p&gt;While there is strong evidence showing the survival advantage of elite athletes, much less is known about those engaged in mind sports such as chess. This study aimed to examine the overall as well as regional survival of International Chess Grandmasters (GMs) with a reference to the general population, and compare relative survival (RS) of GMs with that of Olympic medallists (OMs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Information on 1,208 GMs and 15,157 OMs, respectively, from 28 countries were extracted from the publicly available data sources. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival rates of the GMs. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust the survival for region, year at risk, age at risk and sex, and to estimate the life expectancy of the GMs. The RS rate was computed by matching each GM or OM by year at risk, age at risk and sex to the life table of the country the individual represented.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The survival rates of GMs at 30 and 60 years since GM title achievement were 87% and 15%, respectively. The life expectancy of GMs at the age of 30 years (which is near the average age when they attained a GM title) was 53.6 ([95% CI]: 47.7–58.5) years, which is significantly greater than the overall weighted mean life expectancy of 45.9 years for the general population. Compared to Eastern Europe, GMs in North America (HR [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.29–0.88]) and Western Europe (HR [95% CI]: 0.53 [0.34–0.83]) had a longer lifespan. The RS analysis showed that both GMs and OMs had a significant survival advantage over the general population, and there was no statistically significant difference in the RS of GMs (RS [95% CI]: 1.14 [1.08–1.20]) compared to OMs: (RS [95% CI]: 1.09 [1.07–1.11]) at 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Elite chess players live longer than the general population and have a similar survival advantage to elite competitors in physical sports.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196938</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af1:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by An Tran-Duy, David C.

Influenza A virus infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and currently available prevention and treatment methods are suboptimal. In recent years, genome-wide investigations have revealed numerous host factors that are required for influenza to successfully complete its life cycle. However, only a select, small number of influenza strains were evaluated using this platform, and there was considerable variation in the genes identified across different investigations. In an effort to develop a universally efficacious therapeutic strategy with limited potential for the emergence of resistance, this study was performed to investigate the effect of combinatorial RNA interference (RNAi) on inhibiting the replication of diverse influenza A virus subtypes and strains. Candidate genes were selected for targeting based on the results of multiple previous independent genome-wide studies. The effect of single and combinatorial RNAi on the replication of 12 diverse influenza A viruses, including three strains isolated from birds and one strain isolated from seals, was then evaluated in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. After excluding overly toxic siRNA, two siRNA combinations were identified that reduced mean viral replication by greater than 79 percent in all mammalian strains, and greater than 68 percent in all avian strains. Host-directed combinatorial RNAi effectively prevents growth of a broad range of influenza virus strains &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for further development and future &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197246</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721f:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael A.

In an effort to develop a universally efficacious therapeutic strategy with limited potential for the emergence of resistance, this study was performed to investigate the effect of combinatorial RNA interference (RNAi) on inhibiting the replication of diverse influenza A virus subtypes and strains. Candidate genes were selected for targeting based on the results of multiple previous independent genome-wide studies. The effect of single and combinatorial RNAi on the replication of 12 diverse influenza A viruses, including three strains isolated from birds and one strain isolated from seals, was then evaluated in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. After excluding overly toxic siRNA, two siRNA combinations were identified that reduced mean viral replication by greater than 79 percent in all mammalian strains, and greater than 68 percent in all avian strains. Host-directed combinatorial RNAi effectively prevents growth of a broad range of influenza virus strains &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for further development and future &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197069</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197069</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Corey L.

The biological impetus for gene dosage and allele specificity of mammalian imprinted genes is not fully understood. To address this, we generated and analyzed four sets of mice from a single breeding scheme with varying allelic expression and gene dosage of the &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; domain. The mutants with abrogation of the two paternally expressed genes, &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt;, showed a significant decrease in growth rates for both males and females, while the mutants with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; resulted in an increased growth rate of female mice only. The mutant cohort with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; tended to have greater numbers of pups compared to the other genotypes. The mutants with switched active alleles displayed overall similar phenotypes to the wild type, but did show some differences in gene expression, suggesting potential non-redundant roles contributed by the maternal and paternal alleles. Overall, this study demonstrates a novel &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; approach to investigate the allele and dosage specificity of mammalian imprinted domains.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197069</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42269:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Corey L.

Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris (ARMD) is a major cause of implant failure leading to revision surgery in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties. However, the pathogenesis and its association to implant wear are poorly understood and previous studies have yielded discrepant results. We sought to investigate the associations between histological findings, whole blood and synovial fluid metal ion concentrations and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations in patients with MoM total hip replacements and hip resurfacings revised for ARMD. 107 hips in total were included in our study. Of these, 87 were total hip replacements and 20 were hip resurfacings, respectively. We found that whole blood, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations correlated poorly with histological findings. We suggest that the lack of a clear association between histological findings and wear measures in the present study as well as in previous studies is mostly influenced by variability in patient susceptibility. However, patients presenting with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration had lower chromium concentration in their periprosthetic tissues than patients with no perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. This may reflect the role of metal hypersensitivity in implant failure in these patients. Patients with total hip replacements evinced more necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration in their tissues than patients with hip resurfacings. This suggests that trunnion wear debris is more cytotoxic and/or immunogenic than bearing wear debris leading to higher failure rates seen in patients with total hip replacements.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197614</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c3:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lari Lehtovirta, Aleksi Reito, Jyrki Parkkinen, Sirpa Peräniemi, Jouko Vepsäläinen, Antti Eskelinen&lt;/p&gt;

Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) that can modulate RNA splicing are used for the treatment of many genetic disorders. To enhance the efficacy of modulating splicing, it is important to optimize SSOs with regard to target sites, GC content, melting temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value), chemistries, and lengths. Thus, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay systems that allow for the rapid and simple screening of SSOs are essential for optimizing SSO design. In this study, we established a novel tri-chromatic reporter cell line for SSO screening. This reporter cell line is designed to express three different fluorescent proteins (blue, green, and red) and was employed for high content screening (HCS, also known as high content analysis; HCA) for the evaluation of SSO-induced exon skipping by analyzing the expression levels of fluorescent proteins. The blue fluorescent protein is stably expressed throughout the cell and is useful for data normalization using cell numbers. Furthermore, both the green and red fluorescent proteins were used for monitoring the splicing patterns of target genes. Indeed, we demonstrated that this novel reporter cell line involving HCS leads to a more rapid and simple approach for the evaluation of exon skipping than widely used methods, such as RT-PCR, western blotting, and quantitative RT-PCR.

Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) that can modulate RNA splicing are used for the treatment of many genetic disorders. To enhance the efficacy of modulating splicing, it is important to optimize SSOs with regard to target sites, GC content, melting temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value), chemistries, and lengths. Thus, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay systems that allow for the rapid and simple screening of SSOs are essential for optimizing SSO design. In this study, we established a novel tri-chromatic reporter cell line for SSO screening. This reporter cell line is designed to express three different fluorescent proteins (blue, green, and red) and was employed for high content screening (HCS, also known as high content analysis; HCA) for the evaluation of SSO-induced exon skipping by analyzing the expression levels of fluorescent proteins. The blue fluorescent protein is stably expressed throughout the cell and is useful for data normalization using cell numbers. Furthermore, both the green and red fluorescent proteins were used for monitoring the splicing patterns of target genes. Indeed, we demonstrated that this novel reporter cell line involving HCS leads to a more rapid and simple approach for the evaluation of exon skipping than widely used methods, such as RT-PCR, western blotting, and quantitative RT-PCR. Additionally, a brief screening of Locked nucleic acids (LNA)-based SSOs targeting exon 51 in &lt;i&gt;DMD&lt;/i&gt; was performed using the reporter cell line. The LNA-based SSO cocktail shows high exon 51 skipping in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the LNA-based SSO cocktails display high exon 51 skipping activities on endogenous &lt;i&gt;DMD&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04367-6</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/HVS-ibjtsAY/s41467-018-04367-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Giovanni Batignani</name></author><published>1526540400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Probing femtosecond lattice displacement upon photo-carrier generation in lead halide perovskite</title><crawled>1526549203209</crawled><fingerprint>fc4c40c7</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04367-6</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Probing femtosecond lattice displacement upon photo-carrier generation in lead halide perovskite&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probing femtosecond lattice displacement upon photo-carrier generation in lead halide perovskite, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04367-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04367-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The electron–phonon coupling is the key to understand optoelectronic properties in lead halide perovskites but it is difficult to probe.

Access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains deficient without an adequate workforce. There is limited understanding of the gender gap in surgical trainees in LMICs. In Rwanda, females fill only one of 20 positions available. Understanding surgeons’ experiences and perceptions of surgical careers may help facilitate support for females to contribute to the global surgical workforce. We performed qualitative analysis on perceptions of surgical careers through semi-structured interviews of all female surgeons (n = 6) and corresponding male surgeons (n = 6) who are training or have trained at University of Rwanda. Transcripts were analyzed with code structure formed through an integrated approach. Question categories formed the deductive framework, while theoretical saturation was reached through inductive grounded theory. Themes were organized within two key points of the career timeline. First, for developing interest in surgery, three main themes were identified: role models, patient case encounters, and exposure to surgery. Second, for selecting and sustaining surgical careers, four main themes emerged: social expectations about roles within the family, physical and mental challenges, professional and personal support, and finances. All female surgeons emphasized gender assumptions and surgical working culture as obstacles, with a corresponding strong sense of self-confidence and internal motivation that drew them to select and maintain careers in surgery. Family, time, and physical endurance were cited as persistent challenges for female participants. Our study reveals concepts for further exploration about gendered perceptions of surgical careers. Efforts to improve support for female surgical careers as a strategy for shaping surgical work culture and professional development in Rwanda should be considered. Such strategies may be beneficial for improving the global surgical workforce.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197290</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915d:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sojung Yi, Yihan Lin, Grace Kansayisa, Ainhoa Costas-Chavarri&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;When attempting to statistically distinguish between a null and an alternative hypothesis, many researchers in the life and social sciences turn to binned statistical analysis methods, or methods that are simply based on the moments of a distribution (such as the mean, and variance). These methods have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and simplicity of explanation.However, when null and alternative hypotheses manifest themselves in subtle differences in patterns in the data, binned analysis methods may be insensitive to these differences, and researchers may erroneously fail to reject the null hypothesis when in fact more sensitive statistical analysis methods might produce a different result when the null hypothesis is actually false.Here, with a focus on two recent conflicting studies of contagion in mass killings as instructive examples, we discuss how the use of unbinned likelihood methods makes optimal use of the information in the data; a fact that has been long known in statistical theory, but perhaps is not as widely appreciated amongst general researchers in the life and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; published a paper that quantified the long-suspected contagion effect in mass killings.

Background &lt;p&gt;When attempting to statistically distinguish between a null and an alternative hypothesis, many researchers in the life and social sciences turn to binned statistical analysis methods, or methods that are simply based on the moments of a distribution (such as the mean, and variance). These methods have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and simplicity of explanation.However, when null and alternative hypotheses manifest themselves in subtle differences in patterns in the data, binned analysis methods may be insensitive to these differences, and researchers may erroneously fail to reject the null hypothesis when in fact more sensitive statistical analysis methods might produce a different result when the null hypothesis is actually false.Here, with a focus on two recent conflicting studies of contagion in mass killings as instructive examples, we discuss how the use of unbinned likelihood methods makes optimal use of the information in the data; a fact that has been long known in statistical theory, but perhaps is not as widely appreciated amongst general researchers in the life and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; published a paper that quantified the long-suspected contagion effect in mass killings. However, in 2017, Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek subsequently published a paper, based upon the same data, that claimed to contradict the results of the earlier study. The former used unbinned likelihood methods, and the latter used binned methods, and comparison of distribution moments.Using these analyses, we also discuss how visualization of the data can aid in determination of the most appropriate statistical analysis methods to distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis. We also discuss the importance of assessment of the robustness of analysis results to methodological assumptions made (for example, arbitrary choices of number of bins and bin widths when using binned methods); an issue that is widely overlooked in the literature, but is critical to analysis reproducibility and robustness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;When an analysis cannot distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis, care must be taken to ensure that the analysis methodology itself maximizes the use of information in the data that can distinguish between the two hypotheses.The use of binned methods by Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek (2017), that examined how many mass killings fell within a 14 day window from a previous mass killing, substantially reduced the sensitivity of their analysis to contagion effects.

If you live in the US, you’ve surely seen various cancer treatment centers talking about their personalized therapy plans, and especially how they’ll tailor things to your DNA sequence and so on. You would get the impression that we have an arsenal of specifically targeted cancer therapies, waiting for patients to get their tumors sequenced so they can be paired with the optimal treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not true. I wish it were, but it just isn’t. And I fear that a lot of patients and their families actually believe that it is, which can make for some bad decisions (both medically and financially). I can hardly blame them much, though, because for years now there’s been a ceaseless flow of stories in the press about targeted therapies, genomic sequencing of patients, breakthroughs, advances, new DNA this and advanced sequence that and on and on. I think it’s safe to say that the average patient does not have the time nor the expertise to keep up with the actual biomedical literature, and thus relies on headlines and advertisements for an impression of the field, and that impression is pretty far off of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; article, which covers a debate at the recent AACR meeting between David Hyman and Vinay Prasad, estimates that only about 15% of patients total are currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/precision-medicine/tumor-dna-sequencing&quot;&gt;even eligible&lt;/a&gt; (under FDA guidelines) to have their tumors sequenced in hope of matching with a targeted therapy. About one third-of those may actually benefit from the process in the end. This is not exactly what you’d expect if all you knew about this stuff was what you heard on TV. The thing is, that’s actually a great advance, because the number used to be zero, in both categories. We really are making progress, and the people who can benefit really can benefit. It’s just that there aren’t nearly as many of them as we’d like, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can’t pin this just on clueless news readers – even back in 2003, the head of the NCI (later head of the FDA, Andy Eschenbach) &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2012/02/23/remember_when_we_were_going_to_eliminate_deaths_from_cancer&quot;&gt;was talking&lt;/a&gt; about “eliminating death and suffering” due to cancer by. . .2015. We have missed that deadline. In 2006 (as that link shows), he was going on in a similar way about how we’d moved to a whole new level, everything had changed, etc. In general, whenever someone starts talking about “the next level” or something like that, I check to make sure my wallet is still in my pocket. This isn’t a game we’re working through – it doesn’t have “levels”, and in fact, not many large complicated real-world things do. Quantized jumps happen on the microscale. Up here, we’re grinding it out, and that’s how cancer therapy is advancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the confusion is that people have different ideas about what “precision targeting” in oncology really is. The term got applied early on to the wave of kinase inhibitors and so on that targeted particular cellular mechanisms (rather than just being wrecking balls like some of the earlier chemotherapy drugs), and that muddied things a bit. Some of the earlier successes in this area came about because some (relatively rare) tumor types really do seem to be pretty genetically homogeneous: they occur in pretty much the same way for the same reasons. So if you target that mechanism, you’re likely to see an effect; it’s like the situation in many human genetic disorders, and it doesn’t happen that way in cancer too often. But the high-profile successes against things like GIST confused some parts the public, I think, into thinking that the different bodily locations of cancer were all like that – genetically distinct from cancer in other organs, but very similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would that it were so. The second level of confusion comes to the DNA-sequencing aspect, which is at least closer to reality in terms of how cancer works, if not its treatment. “OK’, this story goes, “this patient has (something)oma, so let’s take some cells and see what variety of it they have so we can give them the drug that works against that subtype”. That’s what too many people think we have now, and what in a few cases we actually do (as above). But most of the time we don’t really understand what’s going on at a cellular level, as gets proven every time another promising oncology mechanism wipes out in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even with those successes, there’s room to wonder how far this idea can be pushed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/12/precision-oncology-isnt-quite-there-yet&quot;&gt;Here’s a piece on that&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 (more Vinay Prasad), wondering just how precise it’s possible to get. One big problem is that many solid tumors are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/08/16/cancer_cells_too_unstable_for_fine_targeting&quot;&gt;terrible mixture&lt;/a&gt; of cell types. They generally got that way by being &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/20/glioblastoma-is-bad-news-period&quot;&gt;genomically unstable&lt;/a&gt;, and that unstability just goes on and on. That’s where all this fine targeting really runs into trouble: what if a given patient’s tumor is a mixture of eight or nine different cellular forms of cancer? Well, eight or nine that you know about so far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s one reason that immuno-oncology is such a hot field, because (to a first approximation) it’s saying “OK, we don’t know how all you cells became cancerous and we don’t care. We can set it up so that (for example) you all get recognized by killer T cells, and they will take you out no matter what your pedigree”. Problem is, we’re not quite to this stage for all but a very few forms of cancer. By far the most successful are blood-based cancers like leukemia, where the cells really are quite similar to each other by oncology standards, giving you a chance to wipe them out &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;. Getting that to happen for solid tumors is. . .not so easy. The more successful immuno-oncology for solid tumors, so far, is using antibodies to go after potential common mechanisms like PD-L1 that are fending off such T-cell attack, but (a) we don’t have such markers for most solid tumors, and (b) in many cases, the most we can do now, usually, is to wipe out most of of a patient’s tumors (best case) leaving behind an untouched residue of mutated cells that eventually comes back in untreatable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not putting that down at all – this can buy people substantial more life, although not always. In every case, you have to see (with real-world clinical data) how much actual survival you’ve been able to achieve. That’s another big reason that we missed that absurd 2015 date, because it takes years to figure out just how well these therapies actually work in practice. It’s a slog, and I don’t see any way for it not to be a slog, and it’s too bad that that doesn’t make for a very compelling slogan.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>30</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05152-7</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Ken Shirriff</name></author><published>1526454000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Get facts straight on computer women</title><crawled>1526473042015</crawled><fingerprint>93c75a33</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05152-7</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get facts straight on computer women&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get facts straight on computer women, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05152-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05152-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Get facts straight on computer women</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05152-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16368e2285f:3fa1a1e:3dd877af</id><engagementRate>0.01</engagementRate><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get facts straight on computer women&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get facts straight on computer women, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05152-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05152-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Get facts straight on computer women</content></content><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/311985v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/01/311985</canonicalUrl><author><name>Luo, R.</name></author><published>1525158000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Skyhawk: An Artificial Neural Network-based discriminator for reviewing clinically significant genomic variants [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1525170051717</crawled><fingerprint>6dcc379</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/311985v1?rss=1</originId><description>Motivation: Many rare diseases and cancers are fundamentally diseases of the genome.

The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) is widely used to evaluate processing speed and executive function in patients with multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological disorders. In the PASAT, subjects listen to sequences of digits while continuously reporting the sum of the last two digits presented. Four different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) are usually tested, with difficulty increasing as SOAs are reduced. Ceiling effects are common at long SOAs, while the digit delivery rate often exceeds the subject’s processing capacity at short SOAs, causing some subjects to stop performing altogether. In addition, subjects may adopt an “alternate answer” strategy at short SOAs, which reduces the test’s demands on working-memory and processing speed. Consequently, studies have shown that the number of dyads (consecutive correct answers) is a more sensitive measure of PASAT performance than the overall number of correct sums. Here, we describe a 2.5-minute computerized test, the Dyad-Adaptive PASAT (DA-PASAT), where SOAs are adjusted with a 2:1 staircase, decreasing after each pair of correct responses and increasing after misses. Processing capacity is reflected in the minimum SOA (minSOA) achieved in 54 trials. Experiment 1 gathered normative data in two large populations: 1617 subjects in New Zealand ranging in age from 18 to 65 years, and 214 Californians ranging in age from 18 to 82 years. Minimum SOAs were influenced by age, education, and daily hours of computer-use. Minimum SOA z-scores, calculated after factoring out the influence of these factors, were virtually identical in the two control groups, as were response times (RTs) and dyad ratios (the proportion of hits occurring in dyads). Experiment 2 measured the test-retest reliability of the DA-PASAT in 44 young subjects who underwent three test sessions at weekly intervals. High intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were found for minSOAs (0.87), response times (0.76), and dyad ratios (0.87). Performance improved across test sessions for all measures. Experiment 3 investigated the effects of simulated malingering in 50 subjects: 42% of simulated malingerers produced abnormal (p&amp;lt; 0.05) minSOA z-scores. Simulated malingerers with abnormal scores were distinguished with 87% sensitivity and 69% specificity from control subjects with abnormal scores by excessive differences between training performance and the actual test. Experiment 4 investigated patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI): patients with mild TBI performed within the normal range while patients with severe TBI showed deficits. The DA-PASAT reduces the time and stress of PASAT assessment while gathering sensitive measures of dyad processing that reveal the effects of aging, malingering, and traumatic brain injury on performance.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7ea:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by David L.

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time. The model was used to forecast cholera incidence for the months after the passage of the hurricane (October-December 2016) and to predict the impact of a planned oral cholera vaccination campaign. Our first projection, from October 29 to December 31, predicted the highest incidence in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud, accounting for about 45% of the total cases in Haiti. The projection included a second peak in cholera incidence in early December largely driven by heavy rainfall forecasts, confirming the urgency for rapid intervention. A second projection (from November 12 to December 31) used updated rainfall forecasts to estimate that 835 cases would be averted by vaccinations in Grande Anse (90% Prediction Interval [PI] 476-1284) and 995 in Sud (90% PI 508-2043). The experience gained by this modeling effort shows that state-of-the-art computational modeling and data-assimilation methods can produce informative near real-time projections of cholera incidence. Collaboration among modelers and field epidemiologists is indispensable to gain fast access to field data and to translate model results into operational recommendations for emergency management during an outbreak. Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1636a1a35e2:4db35:d63e3ae2</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Damiano Pasetto, Flavio Finger, Anton Camacho, Francesco Grandesso, Sandra Cohuet, Joseph C.

Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006127</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04031-z</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/_XaFS1LnlqA/s41467-018-04031-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Maximilian T.

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major mediator of peritoneal fibrosis and reportedly affects expression of the H3K4 methyltransferase, SET7/9. SET7/9-induced H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) critically activates transcription of fibrosis-related genes. In this study, we examined the effect of SET7/9 inhibition on peritoneal fibrosis in mice and in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). We also examined SET7/9 expression in nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Murine peritoneal fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of methylglyoxal (MGO) into male C57/BL6 mice over 21 days. Sinefungin, a SET7/9 inhibitor, was administered subcutaneously just before MGO injection (10 mg/kg). SET7/9 expression was elevated in both MGO-injected mice and nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of PD patients. SET7/9 expression was positively correlated with dialysate/plasma ratio of creatinine in PD patients. Sinefungin was shown immunohistochemically to suppress expression of mesenchymal cells and collagen deposition, accompanied by decreased H3K4me1 levels. Peritoneal equilibration tests showed that sinefungin attenuated the urea nitrogen transport rate from plasma and the glucose absorption rate from the dialysate. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, sinefungin suppressed TGF-β1-induced expression of fibrotic markers and inhibited H3K4me1. These findings suggest that inhibiting the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196844</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3adf:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Tamura, Shigehiro Doi, Ayumu Nakashima, Kensuke Sasaki, Kazuya Maeda, Toshinori Ueno, Takao Masaki&lt;/p&gt;

Because punishments are expected to give offenders what they deserve proportionally to the severity of their offenses, the punishment of an entire group because of the misdeed of a few of its members is generally considered as unfair. Group entitativity might increase support for such collective punishment, because members of highly entitative groups are perceived as more similar and interchangeable. We designed three experiments comparing support for third-party collective punishment of low versus high entitative groups. As comparison base-rate, we included conditions in which participants punish an individual wrongdoer (Experiments 1 &amp;amp; 2). Results show that although support for individual punishment is higher than support for collective punishment, this difference was reduced (Experiment 1) or absent (Experiment 2) when the group was highly entitative. Experiment 3 replicated the increasing effect of group entitativity on support for collective punishment. We conclude that group entitativity increases the likelihood of an entire group being treated as a single unit, facilitating collective punishment when a few group members commit an offense.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196852</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3ae2:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Pereira, Jan-Willem van Prooijen&lt;/p&gt;

Nevertheless, they are very difficult to detect by homology-based methods and so far have escaped annotation in the majority of the genomes of Saccharomycotina. This is a consequence of sequences that evolve rapidly at nucleotide level, are subject to large variations in size, and are highly plastic with respect to their secondary structures. Here we report on a survey that was aimed at closing this gap in RNA annotation. Despite considerable efforts and the combination of a variety of different methods, it was only partially successful. While 27 new telomerase RNAs were identified, we had to restrict our efforts to the subgroup Saccharomycetacea because even this narrow subgroup was diverse enough to require different search models for different phylogenetic subgroups.

Nevertheless, they are very difficult to detect by homology-based methods and so far have escaped annotation in the majority of the genomes of Saccharomycotina. This is a consequence of sequences that evolve rapidly at nucleotide level, are subject to large variations in size, and are highly plastic with respect to their secondary structures. Here we report on a survey that was aimed at closing this gap in RNA annotation. Despite considerable efforts and the combination of a variety of different methods, it was only partially successful.

The spatial distribution of nine Northwest Atlantic groundfish stocks was documented using spatial indicators based on Northeast Fisheries Science Center spring and fall bottom trawl survey data, 1963–2016. We then evaluated the relative importance of population size, fishing pressure and bottom temperature on spatial distribution with an information theoretic approach. Northward movement in the spring was generally consistent with prior analyses, whereas changes in depth distribution and area occupancy were not. Only two stocks exhibited the same changes in spatiotemporal distribution in the fall as compared with the spring. Fishing pressure was the most important predictor of the center of gravity (i.e., bivariate mean location of the population) for the majority of stocks in the spring, whereas in the fall this was restricted to the east-west component. Fishing pressure was also the most important predictor of the dispersion around the center of gravity in both spring and fall. In contrast, biomass was the most important predictor of area occupancy for the majority of stocks in both seasons. The relative importance of bottom temperature was ranked highest in the fewest number of cases. This study shows that fishing pressure, in addition to the previously established role of climate, influences the spatial distribution of groundfish in the Northwest Atlantic. More broadly, this study is one of a small but growing body of literature to demonstrate that fishing pressure has an effect on the spatial distribution of marine resources. Future work must consider both fishing pressure and climate when examining mechanisms underlying fish distribution shifts.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196583</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7f:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Charles F.

Extra macrochaetae (Emc) forms inactive heterodimers with both proneural bHLH proteins and their bHLH partners (represented in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; by Daughterless). It is generally thought that varying levels of Emc define a prepattern that determines where proneural bHLH genes can be effective. We report that instead it is the bHLH proteins that determine the pattern of Emc levels. Daughterless level sets Emc protein levels in most cells, apparently by stabilizing Emc in heterodimers.

Extra macrochaetae (Emc) forms inactive heterodimers with both proneural bHLH proteins and their bHLH partners (represented in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; by Daughterless). It is generally thought that varying levels of Emc define a prepattern that determines where proneural bHLH genes can be effective. We report that instead it is the bHLH proteins that determine the pattern of Emc levels. Daughterless level sets Emc protein levels in most cells, apparently by stabilizing Emc in heterodimers. Emc is destabilized in proneural regions by local competition for heterodimer formation by proneural bHLH proteins including Atonal or AS-C proteins. Reflecting this post-translational control through protein stability, uniform &lt;i&gt;emc&lt;/i&gt; transcription is sufficient for almost normal patterns of neurogenesis. Protein stability regulated by exchanges between bHLH protein dimers could be a feature of bHLH-mediated developmental events.</description><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303875v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/20/303875</canonicalUrl><author><name>Schmiedel, J.</name></author><published>1524207600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Determining protein structures using genetics [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1524216902377</crawled><fingerprint>47d7c87a</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303875v1?rss=1</originId><description>Determining the three dimensional structures of macromolecules is a major goal of biological research because of the close relationship between structure and function.

A tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant mechanism is responsible for the electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions and relaxations of &lt;i&gt;Crotalus durissus terrificus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa. Here it was investigated whether this mechanism also occurs in corpora cavernosa and aortae of the non-venomous snake &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortae. Corpora cavernosa and aortic rings isolated from &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; snake were mounted in organ bath system for isometric tension recording. EFS-induced contractions in both tissues were performed in the presence and absence of guanethidine (30 μM), phentolamine (10 μM) and tetrodotoxin (1 μM). In another set of experiments, the endothelium was removed from aortic rings and EFS-induced contractions were performed in the denuded rings. Electrical field stimulation-induced contractions were frequency-dependent in &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortic rings. The contractions were significantly reduced in the presence of guanethidine (30 μM) or phentolamine (10 μM). Pre-treatment with tetrodotoxin had no effect on the EFS-induced contractions of either corpora cavernosa or aortic rings. Surprisingly, the EFS-induced contractions of aortic rings denuded of endothelium were almost abolished. These results indicate that the TTX-resistant mechanism is present in EFS-induced contractions of &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortae.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH. Consistently funded interventions included testing, partner services and linkage to care and interventions for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal allocation shifted when there were differences in transmission category proportions and progress along the HIV care continuum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The robustness of the results suggests that most health departments can use these analyses to guide the investment of CDC HIV prevention funds into strategies to prevent the most new cases of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03944-z</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/rxrstRo9zmM/s41467-018-03944-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Matthias Konrad-Schmolke</name></author><published>1524553200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Mineral dissolution and reprecipitation mediated by an amorphous phase</title><crawled>1524561842776</crawled><fingerprint>14c42520</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03944-z</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mineral dissolution and reprecipitation mediated by an amorphous phase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mineral dissolution and reprecipitation mediated by an amorphous phase, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03944-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03944-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Fluid-mediated mineral dissolution is a key mechanism for mineral reactions in the Earth.

Here we introduce Melissa (MEthyLation Inference for Single cell Analysis), a Bayesian hierarchical method to quantify spatially-varying methylation profiles across genomic regions from single-cell bisulfite sequencing data (scBS-seq). Melissa clusters individual cells based on local methylation patterns, enabling the discovery of epigenetic differences and similarities among individual cells. The clustering also acts as an effective regularisation method for imputation of methylation on unassayed CpG sites, enabling transfer of information between individual cells. We show both on simulated and real data sets that Melissa provides accurate and biologically meaningful clusterings, and state-of-the-art imputation performance.

An R implementation of Melissa is publicly available at https://github.com/andreaskapou/Melissa.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/678?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/678?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/678.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Li, S.</name></author><published>1525974003000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Pitch imperfect</title><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><fingerprint>433e2877</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/678?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7fc:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4314.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4314</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Peter A.

Transverse lines, called Harris Lines (HL), osteological markers of recovery from growth arrest episodes, are visible in radiograms of recent and Pleistocene fossil bones. Since on the one hand they mark stressful episodes in life, and on the other are mainly used to trace health fluctuations in prehistoric human communities, I used a cave bear population to check if the processes that could affect the specie’ condition were in any way reflected in the bone structure. 392 bear bones from Bear Cave in Kletno (collection: Department of Palaeozoology, University of Wrocław), dated as 32 100 ±1300 to &gt;49 000 years BP, were radiologically examined. The bones were found in a non-anatomical position; morphological analysis indicated that they belonged to different individuals. HL shadows were observed on 9 tibiae and 3 radii: 8.8% out of the 59 tibiae and 77 radii and 3.1% of all the bones. At least 3 transverse lines were recognised in those cases; the specimens were histologically examined. The bear individuals in question experienced regular malnutrition periods during their ontogeny. Starvation resulting in growth inhibition involved young individuals, aged 1 to 4 years. Juveniles aged 6 months, i.e. before weaning, or younger, showed no signs of nutritional stress. Starvation periods associated with seasonal food deficit were not long or common and had no significant effect on the development and welfare of the species. This is the first description of the occurrence of transverse lines in the Pleistocene bear.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196342</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba6:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dariusz Nowakowski&lt;/p&gt;

Haploinsufficiency, a dominant phenotype caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation, has been rarely observed. However, high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping of yeast morphological characteristics revealed haploinsufficiency phenotypes for more than half of 1,112 essential genes under optimal growth conditions. Additionally, 40% of the essential genes with no obvious phenotype under optimal growth conditions displayed haploinsufficiency under severe growth conditions. Haploinsufficiency was detected more frequently in essential genes than in nonessential genes. Similar haploinsufficiency phenotypes were observed mostly in mutants with heterozygous deletion of functionally related genes, suggesting that haploinsufficiency phenotypes were caused by functional defects of the genes. A global view of the gene network was presented based on the similarities of the haploinsufficiency phenotypes. Our dataset contains rich information regarding essential gene functions, providing evidence that single-cell phenotyping is a powerful approach, even in the heterozygous condition, for analyzing complex biological systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/T_6m60ob9nc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><engagementRate>0.04</engagementRate><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1636a0d7f35:4c6cd:d63e3ae2</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shinsuke Ohnuki, Yoshikazu Ohya&lt;/p&gt;

To navigate their surroundings, cells rely on sensory input that is corrupted by noise. In cells performing chemotaxis, such noise arises from the stochastic binding of signalling molecules at low chemoattractant concentrations. We reveal a fundamental relationship between the speed of chemotactic steering and the strength of directional fluctuations that result from the amplification of noise in a chemical input signal. This relation implies a trade-off between steering that is slow and reliable, and steering that is fast but less reliable. We show that dynamic switching between these two modes of steering can substantially increase the probability to find a target, such as an egg to be found by sperm cells. This decision making confers no advantage in the absence of noise, but is beneficial when chemical signals are detectable, yet characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios. The latter applies at intermediate distances from a target, where signalling molecules are diluted, thus defining a ‘noise zone’ that cells have to cross. Our results explain decision making observed in recent experiments on sea urchin sperm chemotaxis. More generally, our theory demonstrates how decision making enables chemotactic agents to cope with high levels of noise in gradient sensing by dynamically adjusting the persistence length of a biased random walk.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0k29V7Enzbw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162df187f34:50ab5:a077e55f</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Justus A.

The emergence of bacteria and cancer cells showing resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) has fostered a search for new, more selective and more effective alternatives to CAMPs. With this goal in mind, we looked for cecropin homologs in the genome and transcriptome of the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana. Not only did we find paralogs of the conventional cationic cecropins (Cfcec+), our screening also led to the identification of previously uncharacterized anionic cecropins (Cfcec-), featuring a poly-L-aspartic acid C-terminus. Comparative peptide analysis indicated that the C-terminal helix of Cfcec- is amphipathic, unlike that of Cfcec+, which is hydrophobic. Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulations pointed to the lower conformational flexibility of Cfcec- peptides, relative to that of Cfcec+. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the evolution of distinct Cfcec+ and Cfcec- peptides may have resulted from an ancient duplication event within the Lepidoptera. Our analyses also indicated that Cfcec- shares characteristics with entericidins, which are involved in bacterial programmed cell death, lunasin, a peptide of plant origins with antimitotic effects, and APC15, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex. Finally, we found that both anionic and cationic cecropins contain a BH3-like motif (G-[KQR]-[HKQNR]-[IV]-[KQR]) that could interact with Bcl-2, a protein involved in apoptosis; this observation is congruent with previous reports indicating that cecropins induce apoptosis. Altogether, our observations suggest that cecropins may provide templates for the development of new anticancer drugs.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/307702v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162fbc93e3c:1fb331:91749e5b</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Cecropins form a family of amphipathic -helical cationic peptides with broad-spectrum antibacterial properties and potent anticancer activity.

The ability to determine the origin of soybeans is an important issue following the inclusion of this information in the labeling of agricultural food products becoming mandatory in South Korea in 2017. This study was carried out to construct a prediction model for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybeans using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis. The optimal prediction models for discriminating soybean samples were obtained by selecting appropriate scaling methods, normalization methods, variable influence on projection (VIP) cutoff values, and wave-number regions. The factors for constructing the optimal partial-least-squares regression (PLSR) prediction model were using second derivatives, vector normalization, unit variance scaling, and the 4000–400 cm&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; region (excluding water vapor and carbon dioxide). The PLSR model for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybean samples had the best predictability when a VIP cutoff value was not applied. When Chinese soybean samples were identified, a PLSR model that has the lowest root-mean-square error of the prediction value was obtained using a VIP cutoff value of 1.5. The optimal PLSR prediction model for discriminating Korean soybean samples was also obtained using a VIP cutoff value of 1.5. This is the first study that has combined FT-IR spectroscopy with normalization methods, VIP cutoff values, and selected wave-number regions for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybeans.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196315</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fac:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Byeong-Ju Lee, Yaoyao Zhou, Jae Soung Lee, Byeung Kon Shin, Jeong-Ah Seo, Doyup Lee, Young-Suk Kim, Hyung-Kyoon Choi&lt;/p&gt;

However, species-level resolution is only achieved after a process of &amp;quot;binning&amp;quot; where contigs predicted to originate from the same genome are clustered. Such culture-independent sequencing frequently unearths novel microbes, and so various methods have been devised for reference-free binning. Existing methods, however, suffer from: (1) reliance on human pattern recognition, which is inherently unscalable; (2) requirement for multiple co-assembled metagenomes, which degrades assembly quality due to strain variance; and (3) assumption of prior host genome removal not feasible for non-model hosts. We therefore devised a fully-automated pipeline, termed &amp;quot;Autometa,&amp;quot; to address these issues. Results: Autometa implements a method for taxonomic partitioning of contigs based on predicted protein homology, and this was shown to vastly improve binning in host-associated and complex metagenomes. Autometa&apos;s method of automated clustering, based on Barnes-Hut Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (BH-tSNE) and DBSCAN, was shown to be highly scalable, outperforming other binning pipelines in complex simulated datasets.

Although several algorithms for analysing multi-omic data exist, no study has yet performed a detailed comparison of these methods in biologically relevant contexts.

Using simulated and real multi-omic data, we find that tICA outperforms established methods in identifying biological sources of data variation at a significantly reduced computational cost. Using two independent multi cell-type EWAS, we further demonstrate how tICA can identify, in the absence of genotype information, mQTLs at a higher sensitivity than competing multi-way algorithms. We validate mQTLs found with tICA in an independent set, and demonstrate that approximately 75$\%$ of mQTLs are independent of blood cell subtype. In an application to multi-omic cancer data, tICA identifies many gene modules whose expression variation across tumors is driven by copy number or DNA methylation changes, but whose deregulation relative to the normal state is independent such alterations, an important finding that we confirm by direct analysis of individual data types. In summary, tICA is a powerful novel algorithm for decomposing multi-omic data, which will be of great value to the research community.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300277v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163506186b5:1e2a223:2835af05</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>There is an increased need for integrative analyses of multi-omic data.

Here we delineate distinct domains of the fission yeast nuclear envelope (NE), focusing on regions enriched for the inner NE protein, Bqt4, or the lamin interacting domain protein, Lem2. Bqt4 is relatively mobile around the NE and acts in two capacities. First, Bqt4 tethers chromosome termini and the &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt; locus to the NE specifically while these regions are replicating. This positioning is required for accurate heterochromatin replication. Second, Bqt4 mobilizes a subset of Lem2 molecules around the NE to promote pericentric heterochromatin maintenance.

Here we delineate distinct domains of the fission yeast nuclear envelope (NE), focusing on regions enriched for the inner NE protein, Bqt4, or the lamin interacting domain protein, Lem2. Bqt4 is relatively mobile around the NE and acts in two capacities. First, Bqt4 tethers chromosome termini and the &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt; locus to the NE specifically while these regions are replicating. This positioning is required for accurate heterochromatin replication. Second, Bqt4 mobilizes a subset of Lem2 molecules around the NE to promote pericentric heterochromatin maintenance. Opposing Bqt4-dependent Lem2 mobility are factors that stabilize Lem2 beneath the centrosome, where Lem2 plays a crucial role in kinetochore maintenance. Our data prompt a model in which Bqt4-rich nuclear subdomains are ‘safe zones’ in which collisions between transcription and replication are averted and heterochromatin is reassembled faithfully.</description><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04221-9</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/95Xhvq0aKyk/s41467-018-04221-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Alison Roth</name></author><published>1525849200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>A comprehensive model for assessment of liver stage therapies targeting Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum</title><crawled>1525858023424</crawled><fingerprint>446be04e</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04221-9</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A comprehensive model for assessment of liver stage therapies targeting &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive model for assessment of liver stage therapies targeting &amp;lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04221-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04221-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Currently available platforms to study liver stage of Plasmodium species have limitations.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>118</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16340d7cea2:14b5655:abeb7260</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew E.

Aim &lt;p&gt;To determine choroidal thickness in healthy Indian subjects using Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective, observational, cross-sectional study; healthy Indian subjects (n = 230) with no history of ocular and/or systemic disorders were enrolled in the study. Choroidal thickness was measured for 230 eyes using SS-OCT. Subjects were divided into six age groups. Main outcome measures were subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and macular choroidal thickness (MCT) up to 3 mm at 500-micron interval from the fovea was measured in eight different quadrants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean SFCT was 307±79 μm and mean MCT was 285±75 μm. No difference in the choroidal thickness was found among genders. Mean SFCT of the different age groups was 327±68 μm (12–18 years), 364±70 μm (18.1–30 years), 321±78 μm (30.1–40 years), 304±79 μm (40.1–50 years), 283±69 μm (50.1–60 years) and 262±72μm (above 60 years; p &amp;lt;0.001; One way ANOVA). Mean macular choroidal thickness was 305±60 μm, 342±61 μm, 306±72 μm, 282±79 μm, 261±66 μm, 238±68μm respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001; one way ANOVA). A significant weak negative correlation was found between age with SFCT (r = -0.368, p&amp;lt;0.001) and MCT (r = -0.40, p&amp;lt;0.001). No significant correlation was found with refractive error, axial length and ocular perfusion pressure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that mean SFCT and MCT was 307±79μm and 285±75 μm, respectively, among healthy Indian subjects.

As the development of new classes of antibiotics slows, bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem. A potential solution is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth, anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial clearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule 7 coupled polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to host cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model consists of two physical compartments: the host cells and the exudate. It is found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the host cells and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the host cells into the exudate.

As the development of new classes of antibiotics slows, bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem. A potential solution is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth, anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial clearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule 7 coupled polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to host cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model consists of two physical compartments: the host cells and the exudate. It is found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the host cells and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the host cells into the exudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the bacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or continuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible. Lastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our mathematical model.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MQif6tb7BiM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006071</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/438/eaat4478?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/438/eaat4478.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Langelier, C.</name></author><published>1524678502000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>[Editors&apos; Choice] A firsthand view of how secondhand smoke disrupts airway immunity</title><crawled>1524679859179</crawled><fingerprint>f5941ebe</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/438/eaat4478?rss=1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic tobacco smoke exposure exacerbates &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/i&gt; infection by disrupting innate and adaptive immune responses in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/438/eaat4478?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_162fe005beb:5f2ce3:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Chronic tobacco smoke exposure exacerbates &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/i&gt; infection by disrupting innate and adaptive immune responses in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Revisiting_the_Thermodynamic_Stability_of_Indomethacin_Polymorphs_with_Low-Frequency_Vibrational_Spectroscopy_and_Quantum_Mechanical_Simulations/6155150</link><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1524096000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The two major polymorphs of the active pharmaceutical ingredient indomethacin were studied using a combination of experimental low-frequency vibrational spectroscopies, theoretical solid-state density functional theory and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics calculations.

The Wiener polarity number (which, nowadays, known as the Wiener polarity index and usually denoted by &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) was devised by the chemist Harold Wiener, for predicting the boiling points of alkanes.

The solution of such inverse problems may be helpful in speeding up the discovery of lead compounds having the desired properties. This paper is devoted to solving a stronger version of the inverse problem based on Wiener polarity index for chemical trees.

NKp46, a natural killer (NK) cell–activating receptor, is involved in NK cell cytotoxicity against virus-infected cells or tumor cells. However, the role of NKp46 in other NKp46&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; non-NK innate lymphoid cell (ILC) populations has not yet been characterized. Here, an NKp46 deficiency model of natural cytotoxicity receptor 1 (&lt;i&gt;Ncr1&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;gfp/gfp&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ncr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;gfp/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, i.e., homozygous and heterozygous knockout (KO), was used to explore the role of NKp46 in regulating the development of the NKp46&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ILCs. Surprisingly, our studies demonstrated that homozygous NKp46 deficiency resulted in a nearly complete depletion of the ILC1 subset (ILC1) of group 1 ILCs, and heterozygote KO decreased the number of cells in the ILC1 subset. Moreover, transplantation studies confirmed that ILC1 development depends on NKp46 and that the dependency is cell intrinsic. Interestingly, however, the cell depletion specifically occurred in the ILC1 subset but not in the other ILCs, including ILC2s, ILC3s, and NK cells. Thus, our studies reveal that NKp46 selectively participates in the regulation of ILC1 development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oHgr98r15pw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16308d599a6:5375ee:a96d255</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yufeng Wang, Wenjuan Dong, Yibo Zhang, Michael A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Burden of disease studies intend to improve public health decision-making and to measure social and economic impact in population. The objective of this study was to describe the burden of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in Ecuador between 2011 and 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Five-year period morbidity and mortality data available from national agencies of statistics was analyzed to estimate the burden of disease attributable to acute respiratory infections. Cases and deaths registered were grouped according to their ICD-10 code into three diagnostic groups: Acute upper respiratory infections (J00-J06), Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), and Bronchitis and other acute lower respiratory infections (J20-J22, J85, J86). Disability-adjusted life years stratified by diagnostic and age group were calculated using the “DALY” package for R. The productivity loss in monetary terms was estimated using the human capital method.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Over the 5-year period studied there were a total of 14.84 million cases of acute respiratory infections, with 17 757 deaths reported (0.12%). The yearly burden of disease ranged between 98 944 to 118 651 disability-adjusted life years, with an estimated average loss of productivity of US$152.16 million (±19.6) per year. Approximately 99% of the burden can be attributed to years life lost due to premature mortality in population under 5 years old and over 60 years-old.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The burden of acute respiratory infections remained steady during the analyzed period.

Evidence-based prevention and control policies to tackle acute respiratory infections in Ecuador should focus on the population at extreme ages of life.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-q?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-q?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.17.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Fahrenkamp-Uppenbrink, J.</name></author><published>1525974002000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Knowing how to prevent induced earthquakes</title><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><fingerprint>e278b830</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-q?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7d2:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/439/eaao4521?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/439/eaao4521.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Lim, S.-Y., Osuna, C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Anti-RhD immunised donors provide anti-RhD immunoglobulins used for the prevention of rhesus disease. These donors are periodically hyper-immunised (boostered) to retain a high titer level of anti-RhD.&lt;/p&gt; Study design and methods &lt;p&gt;We analysed anti-RhD donor records from 1998 to 2016, consisting of 30,116 anti-RhD titers from 755 donors, encompassing 3,372 booster events. Various models were fit to these data to allow describing the anti-RhD titers over time.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A random effects model with a log-linear anti-RhD titer decline over time and a saturating titer response to boostering is shown to fit the data well. This model contains two general model parameters, relating timing and maximum of the booster effect, as well as two parameters characterizing the individual donor, namely how fast the booster effect saturates with current titer and the anti-RhD decline rate. The average individual log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decline is 0.55 per year, i.e. a 32% decline in absolute titer, with half of the donors declining between 13% and 41% per year. Their anti-RhD titer peaks around 26 days following a booster event. Boostering response reduces with higher titers at boostering; at median titer (log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 11) the mean increase per booster is log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 0.38, that is from an absolute titer of 2048 to 2665 (+30%), with half of all donors increasing between 16% and 65% in their titer.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The model describes anti-RhD titer change per individual with only four parameters, two of which are donor specific.

Thus, compartmentalized NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; synthesis functions as an integrator of cellular metabolism and signal-dependent transcriptional programs.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>29</engagement></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025120?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025120?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Giovanni Garberoglio</name></author><published>1525231998000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><crawled>1525677623336</crawled><fingerprint>c398aad5</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025120?af=R</originId><title>Time correlation functions of simple liquids: A new insight on the underlying dynamical processes</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16339790828:2611d95:3dd877af</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/17&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Hydration_Structure_of_Methylthiolate_from_QM_MM_Molecular_Dynamics/6199340</link><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1525046400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Thiols are widely present in biological systems, most notably as the side chain of cysteine amino acids in proteins.

The ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 degrade extracellular ATP to adenosine. ATP is released by stressed or damaged cells and provides pro-inflammatory signals to immune cells through P2 receptors. Adenosine, on the other hand, suppresses immune cells by stimulating P1 receptors. Thus, CD39 and CD73 can shape the quality of immune responses. Here we demonstrate that upregulation of CD39 is a consistent feature of activated conventional CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Following stimulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells from human blood gained surface expression of CD39 but displayed only low levels of CD73. Activated human T cells from inflamed joints largely presented with a CD39&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD73&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype. In line, in spleens of mice with acute &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, listeria-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells acquired a CD39&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD73&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype. To test the function of CD39 in control of bacterial infection, CD39-deficient (CD39&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) mice were infected with &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;. CD39&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed better initial control of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, which was associated with enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines. In the late stage of infection, CD39&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice accumulated more listeria-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the spleen than wildtype animals suggesting that CD39 attenuates the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell response to infection. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CD39 is upregulated on conventional CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells at sites of acute infection and inflammation, and that CD39 dampens responses to bacterial infection.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197151</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee6:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Friederike Raczkowski, Anne Rissiek, Isabell Ricklefs, Kirsten Heiss, Valéa Schumacher, Kira Wundenberg, Friedrich Haag, Friedrich Koch-Nolte, Eva Tolosa, Hans-Willi Mittrücker&lt;/p&gt;

CD39&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed better initial control of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, which was associated with enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines. In the late stage of infection, CD39&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice accumulated more listeria-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the spleen than wildtype animals suggesting that CD39 attenuates the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell response to infection. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CD39 is upregulated on conventional CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells at sites of acute infection and inflammation, and that CD39 dampens responses to bacterial infection.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/3998.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/3998</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>William A.

The bionematicidal effect of a synthetic volatile mixture (SVM) of four volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the endophytic fungus &lt;i&gt;Daldinia cf&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;concentrica&lt;/i&gt; against the devastating plant-parasitic root-knot nematode &lt;i&gt;Meloidogyne javanica&lt;/i&gt; has been recently demonstrated in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and greenhouse experiments. However, the mode of action governing the observed irreversible paralysis of J2 larvae upon exposure to SVM is unknown. To unravel the mechanism underlying the anthelmintic and nematicidal activities, we used the tractable model worm &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; was also susceptible to both the fungal VOCs and SVM. Among compounds comprising SVM, 3-methyl-1-butanol, (±)-2-methyl-1-butanol, and 4-heptanone showed significant nematicidal activity toward L1, L4 and young adult stages. Egg hatching was only negatively affected by 4-heptanone. To determine the mechanism underlying this activity, we examined the response of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; mutants for glutamate-gated chloride channel and acetylcholine transporter, targets of the nematicidal drugs ivermectin and aldicarb, respectively, to 4-heptanone and SVM. These aldicarb- and ivermectin-resistant mutants retained susceptibility upon exposure to 4-heptanone and SVM. Next, we used &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; TJ356 strain &lt;i&gt;zIs356 (daf-16&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP+rol-6)&lt;/i&gt;, LD1 &lt;i&gt;ldIs7&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;skn-1B/C&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP + pRF4&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;rol-6&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;su1006&lt;/i&gt;))], LD1171 &lt;i&gt;ldIs3 [gcs-1p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;gfp; rol-6(su1006))]&lt;/i&gt;, CL2166 &lt;i&gt;dvIs19 (gst-4p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP)&lt;/i&gt; and CF1553 &lt;i&gt;muIs84 (sod-3p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP+rol-6)&lt;/i&gt;, which have mutations in genes regulating multiple stress responses. Following exposure of L4 larvae to 4-heptanone or SVM, there was clear nuclear translocation of DAF-16::GFP, and SKN-1::GFP indicating that their susceptibility involves DAF-16 and SKN1 regulation. Application of 4-heptanone, but not SVM, induced increased expression of, &lt;i&gt;gcs-1&lt;/i&gt;::GFP and &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt;::GFP compared to controls. In contrast, application of 4-heptanone or SVM to the &lt;i&gt;sod-3&lt;/i&gt;::GFP line elicited a significant decline in overall fluorescence intensity compared to controls, indicating SOD-3 downregulation and therefore overall reduction in cellular redox machinery. Our data indicate that the mode of action of SVM and 4-heptanone from &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cf&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;concentrica&lt;/i&gt; differs from that of currently available nematicides, potentially offering new solutions for nematode management.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196870</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16327afdf14:f05482:3dd877af</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Payal Sanadhya, Patricia Bucki, Orna Liarzi, David Ezra, Abraham Gamliel, Sigal Braun Miyara&lt;/p&gt;

By means of such process, which occurs at a microscopic scale, worn out bone is replaced by new, fully functional one. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously and independently throughout the body, so the whole skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years. Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types; some are specialized in destroying old bone, whereas others produce new bone to replace the former. The whole process is tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced exactly balances that of old one removed and bone microscopic structure is maintained. To date, many regulatory molecules involved in bone remodeling have been identified, but the precise mechanism of BMU operation remains to be fully elucidated.

By means of such process, which occurs at a microscopic scale, worn out bone is replaced by new, fully functional one. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously and independently throughout the body, so the whole skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years. Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types; some are specialized in destroying old bone, whereas others produce new bone to replace the former. The whole process is tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced exactly balances that of old one removed and bone microscopic structure is maintained. To date, many regulatory molecules involved in bone remodeling have been identified, but the precise mechanism of BMU operation remains to be fully elucidated.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), is a transcription factor that governs pathways, such as lipid metabolism and immune response, that have been implicated in the etiology of LOAD. Previously, we established HepG2-derived cell-lines with stable knockdown of PPARγ gene, and showed an increase in mRNA levels of genes mapped in the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; linkage disequilibrium (LD) region on chromosome 19q13.32, with the greatest effect observed for &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;-mRNA. Here, we extended the analysis using our &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown model system and investigated the broader effect on expression changes of genes implicated in LOAD via genome wide association studies (GWAS). We applied the nCounter gene expression assay (NanoString) using a panel of twenty-four LOAD-associated genes inferred by proximity to the top significantly associated SNPs. Two independent &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown cell-lines showed changes in mRNA levels of a total of seven genes compared to a control HepG2 cell-line; six of which, &lt;i&gt;ABCA7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CASS4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CELF1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PTK2B&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ZCWPW1&lt;/i&gt;, were upregulated and one, &lt;i&gt;DSG2&lt;/i&gt;, was downregulated upon &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. Our results propose that &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; may act as a master regulator of the transcription of several genes involved in LOAD pathogenesis.

Production of the iron regulatory peptide hepcidin is tightly controlled by a network of proteins in hepatocytes that sense levels of iron in the circulation (as diferric-transferrin) and in tissues (in ferritin). Human studies show high variability in the normal range of serum hepcidin levels. We have postulated that this may, in part, be related to inter-individual variability in the expression of genes in the iron sensing pathway, potentially governed by epigenetic factors. Here, we have investigated whether genes encoding hepatic iron sensing proteins and hepcidin are regulated by DNA methylation. Experiments were performed on two human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells. Basal expression of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in Huh7 cells compared with HepG2 cells. Analysis of bisulphite-converted DNA from Huh7 cells revealed partial methylation of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; (alpha transcript), which could result in gene silencing. Demethylation using 5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine (AZA) increased &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7. PCR analysis of bisulphite-converted &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; promoter DNA, using methylation-specific primers, revealed no differences between cell lines. However, &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7 was increased by AZA treatment, suggesting that methylation of one or more iron sensing genes may indirectly influence &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; expression. Our study provides evidence that DNA methylation might control expression of &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; and other hepatic iron sensing genes, and indicates that epigenetic influences on iron homeostasis warrant further investigation.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197863</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8544e:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paul A.

‐phosphate (PLP) Schiff Bases, namely the internal and external aldimines, at the active site of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) enzyme in aqueous medium. It is important to determine the relative stability of the two tautomers (ketoenamine and enolimine) of the PLP aldimines to study the catalytic activity of the concerned enzyme. Both the internal PLP aldimine (PLP‐LYS) and the external PLP aldimine (PLP‐SER) of SHMT are found to have a higher stability for the ketoenamine tautomer over the enolimine form.

‐phosphate (PLP) Schiff Bases, namely the internal and external aldimines, at the active site of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) enzyme in aqueous medium. It is important to determine the relative stability of the two tautomers (ketoenamine and enolimine) of the PLP aldimines to study the catalytic activity of the concerned enzyme. Both the internal PLP aldimine (PLP‐LYS) and the external PLP aldimine (PLP‐SER) of SHMT are found to have a higher stability for the ketoenamine tautomer over the enolimine form. The higher stability of the ketoenamine tautomer can be attributed to the more number of favorable interactions of the ketoenamine form with its surroundings at the active site of the enzyme.

I say that because I’ve been actively reading the chemical literature for over thirty years now, and I still keep running across topics that I never knew existed. One of these popped up the other day: racemic protein crystallography. Now there may be a few readers who are all “Oh yeah, sure, you’re just getting around to that?”, but for everyone else, think about that term for a minute. Prepare yourself for a weird excursion into chirality and crystallinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein crystallography, sure – great stuff, although known to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/05/more-on-crystal-formation-this-time-with-proteins&quot;&gt;infested with voodoo&lt;/a&gt; and all that. But racemic? The idea of a racemic protein is a bit weird, because that means a 50/50 mix of enantiomers, and proteins are, of course, pretty much all made up of the naturally (L) amino acids that living cells use crank them out. To get an all (D) protein, you’d have to have a supply of all those unnatural enantiomeric amino acids (which you can buy, albeit not so cheaply). But you’re not going to be able to depend on any cells or ribosomes to make them for you, since we don’t have any mirror-image life handy, so chemical synthesis it is. And that’s doable, too (although the larger the protein chain, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2006/07/19/fuzeons_fallout&quot;&gt;trickier&lt;/a&gt; it gets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the next question you might have is why anyone would want to go to all the trouble. And there we get into some crystallography. If you look at all the basic ways that things can be arranged in three dimensions, with careful attention to what directions and how you’d have to move your basic units around to make them repeat, you are listing “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_group&quot;&gt;space groups&lt;/a&gt;“. And here chemistry (and physics) impinge on pure mathematics, because good ol’ three-dimensional space has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_space_groups&quot;&gt;230 different space groups&lt;/a&gt;: that’s all there are and there ain’t no more. There are several different ways to arrange them and more than several notations for them, as that last link will show you, but mathematically, that’s what we have to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sit around your whole career crystallizing things, you will eventually encounter every single one of them, although (to be sure) there are definitely more and less common ones. But if you do nothing but crystallize proteins, you poor person you, then you will only encounter 65 of them at most. Those are the chiral space groups that don’t have any of the slightly fancier symmetries in them, such as inversion centers or mirror reflections, because chiral protein chains simply cannot be arranged in ways that will allow those things to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as it turns out, if you look at all the protein crystals known and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nsb1295-1062&quot;&gt;bin them out&lt;/a&gt; into those 65 space groups, the &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; group is pretty heavily over-represented, and a few others are right behind it. That link goes into what seems like the explanation: entropy. Those space groups allow for more degrees of freedom, which means that there are (in most cases) simply more opportunities for proteins to fall into that sort of pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you were to go to racemic proteins and crystallize those, you end up with 165 possible space groups, which means that crystallization should, in fact, be easier in general (since there are more ways for it to happen). And since protein crystallization (as it stands) can be a barren wasteland of heartbreak, this is good news. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101123&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; for globular proteins are that about 30% of them can be crystallized through brute-force experimentation, but only about two-thirds of those crystals, at best, give enough high-quality diffraction data to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-biophys-050511-102333&quot;&gt;really does look&lt;/a&gt; like the success rates for racemic crystallization are higher: greater than 85%, actually, which is just unheard of. An outstanding example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin&quot;&gt;ubiquitin&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively small and very biologically important protein that is a &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; pain to crystallize. Its structure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283687906796?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;was determined&lt;/a&gt; in 1987, but as I understand it, almost everyone who studied its crystalline form since then did so by obtaining seed crystals from that original successful team (!) Synthesis of the enantiomeric protein made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.201600101&quot;&gt;dramatic difference&lt;/a&gt;: a standard screen of protein crystallization conditions on the racemate &lt;em&gt;gave diffraction quality crystals in half the wells after an overnight run&lt;/em&gt;. Recently it was shown that this &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b09545&quot;&gt;even applies to&lt;/a&gt; ubiquitin oligomers, which have been considered particularly intractable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racemic-protein idea was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/342133a0&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; in 1989 and first &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/prot.340160308&quot;&gt;achieved&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, and it’s been gathering momentum ever since. The same paper that explained the current protein space group bias predicted, through the same considerations, which new space group(s) would become the most favored as more racemic proteins were studied and according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089617304807&quot;&gt;this recent review&lt;/a&gt;, they’re right on target (between 40 and 50 examples are known to date). The prediction was also made that membrane-bound proteins might be difficult, since they have fewer protein-protein contact points than soluble proteins tend to. Work in this area is still at an early stage, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4629355/&quot;&gt;so far&lt;/a&gt; it looks like you can get X-ray structures for such things, but that they might differ (on a macro subunit-assembly level) from what occurs in the real membranes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all great if you can get past the brutal synthesis part, and that last review and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593117302260&quot;&gt;this shorter recent overview&lt;/a&gt; go into that issue. What’s really made the difference in recent years is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_chemical_ligation&quot;&gt;native chemical ligation&lt;/a&gt;” chemistry on shorter (and unprotected) protein subunits. It’s still not something you undertake lightly, but it’s a lot more feasible than it used to be. And that’s a good thing: protein crystal data is extremely useful (although not quite the Word of God in all situations) and anything that allows us to get more of it, particularly in the tough cases, is welcome indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addendum:&lt;/em&gt; I can’t resist noting the first time I ever came across the idea of a fully enantiomeric protein, which was when I was about 14 years old and reading James Blish’s (rather odd) one-off short Star Trek novel, &lt;em&gt;Spock Must Die&lt;/em&gt;. Blish (as always) couldn’t resist working his own interests into it, so you have oddities like Uhura being a devotee of James Joyce and &lt;em&gt;Finnegan’s Wake&lt;/em&gt; in particular, which raised my eyebrows, Spock-like, even as a 14-year-old. At any rate, a key plot point is the emergency trial of a souped-up long range transporter beam that sends a copy of the person involved. Spock gets into the thing – mind you, they should have tried it on a box lunch of roast beef sandwiches or something first, but that’s the 1960s &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; – and the beam ends up unexpectedly reflecting back and producing an apparently identical Spock, to great consternation, not least because there’s some confusion about which one is the original. One of the two ends up barricading himself inside Dr. McCoy’s laboratories for reasons unknown, and when they discover that he’s the duplicate, one proof is that they find that he’s been in there &lt;em&gt;synthesizing enantiomeric proteins and carbohydrates&lt;/em&gt; in order to survive. That reflection reversed him down to his molecular chirality, you see, so. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>10</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197357</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197357</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Catharine R.

In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples.

In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples. Scaled quantile residual plots are also introduced as an effective diagnostic to visualize the quality of the estimated probability densities. Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197058</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197058</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Kyu Jin Han</name></author><published>1525726800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Optical coherence tomography automated layer segmentation of macula after retinal detachment repair</title><updated>1525726800000</updated><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><fingerprint>a1d2f9a8</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197058</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kyu Jin Han, Young Hoon Lee&lt;/p&gt;
Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the thickness of retinal layers and association with final visual acuity using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in macular area of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients after a successful macular re-attachment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In retrospective study, a total 24 eyes with macula-off RRD were enrolled. All patients underwent vitrectomy to repair RRD. Outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptor layer (PR), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thicknesses were measured by the Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) SD-OCT with automated segmentation software. The relationship between the thicknesses of each retinal layer and postoperative logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution scale (LogMAR) visual acuity was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;OPL and RPE thicknesses were not significantly different between the retinal detachment eyes and fellow eyes (P = 0.839, 0.999, respectively). The ONL and photoreceptor thickness were significantly thinner in the retinal detachment eyes (P &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.001, respectively). In the univariate regression analysis, preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ONL thickness and photoreceptor thickness showed association with the postoperative BCVA (P = 0.003, &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.024, respectively). In final multiple linear regression model, ONL thickness was the only variable significantly associated with postoperative BCVA (P = 0.044).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Segmented ONL and photoreceptor thickness of retinal detachment eyes were significantly thinner than fellow eyes. Segmental analysis of the retinal layer in macular region may provide valuable information for evaluation RRD.

Human interpretation of diagnostic indicators from visual inspection is qualitative, subjective and has high inter-observer discordance, which could lead both to adverse outcomes for the patient and unnecessary follow-ups. In this work, we propose methods for (1) automatic feature extraction and classification for VIA and VILI cervigrams and (2) combining features of VIA/VILI cervigrams for improved performance. Cervix images (cervigrams) were acquired with a low-cost, miniature, digital colposcope. We describe algorithms to pre-process pathology-labeled cervigrams and extract simple but powerful color and textural-based features. The features are used to train a support vector machine(SVM) to classify cervigrams based on pathology for VIA, VILI, and combination of the two contrasts. The proposed framework achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 81.3%, 78.6%, and 80.0%, respectively when used to distinguish cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN+) relative to normal and benign tissues. This is superior to the average values achieved by expert physicians on the same data set for discriminating normal/benign from CIN+ (sensitivity=77%, specificity=51%, accuracy=63%). The results suggest that utilizing simple color- and textural-based features from VIA and VILI images may provide unbiased automation of cervigrams, enabling automated, expert-level diagnosis of cervical pre-cancer at the point-of-care.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324541v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163706f8a05:4d963b3:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The World Health Organization recommends visual inspection with acetic acid(VIA) and/or Lugol&apos;s iodine(VILI) for cervical cancer screening in low-resource settings. Human interpretation of diagnostic indicators from visual inspection is qualitative, subjective and has high inter-observer discordance, which could lead both to adverse outcomes for the patient and unnecessary follow-ups. In this work, we propose methods for (1) automatic feature extraction and classification for VIA and VILI cervigrams and (2) combining features of VIA/VILI cervigrams for improved performance. Cervix images (cervigrams) were acquired with a low-cost, miniature, digital colposcope. We describe algorithms to pre-process pathology-labeled cervigrams and extract simple but powerful color and textural-based features. The features are used to train a support vector machine(SVM) to classify cervigrams based on pathology for VIA, VILI, and combination of the two contrasts.

Group B &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GBS) carriage by pregnant women is the primary risk factor for early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) can prevent this transmission route, and two main approaches are recommended to base the selection of pregnant women to be submitted to IAP: the risk-based and the culture-based strategies. In Brazil, compliance to such recommendations is poor, and not much is known about GBS carriage. In the present study, 3,647 pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were screened for GBS anogenital colonization, over a period of 8 years (2008–2015). GBS was detected in 956 (26.2%) of them, and presence of vaginal discharge was the only trait associated with a higher risk for GBS colonization. Serotypes Ia (257; 37.3%) and II (137; 19.9%) were the most frequent among 689 (72.1% of the total) GBS isolates evaluated, followed by NT isolates (84; 12.1%), serotype Ib (77; 11.1%), V (63; 9.1%), III (47; 6.8%) and IV (24; 3.5%). Estimated coverage of major serotype-based GBS vaccines currently under clinical trials would vary from 65.2% to 84.3%. All 689 isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, and tetracycline was observed in 5% (35), 2% (14), 14% (97), 5% (35) and 86% (592) of the isolates, respectively. No significant fluctuations in colonization rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were observed throughout the period of time investigated. The culture-based approach for IAP recommendation showed to be the best choice for the population investigated when compared to the risk-based, since the first did not increase the number of pregnant women submitted to antibiotic therapy and covered a larger number of women who were actually colonized by GBS. The fact the not all isolates were available for additional characterization, and serotype IX antiserum was not available for testing represent limitations of this study. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest investigation on GBS carriage among pregnant women in Brazil up to date, and results are useful for improving GBS prevention and treatment strategies.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196925</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6c:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Caroline N.

This paper reports on a social discounting experiment conducted with university students in South Africa. In line with other social discounting task experiments, participants identify target individuals at different degrees of intimacy in their social network and then make 10 choices involving sums of money for themselves or their targets. For an altruism premium to exist, senders’ donations to recipients should be positive, statistically and economically significant, and independent of relationship closeness. We hypothesize that in addition to the altruism premium for kin documented in the literature, there may be other premia for family in general and for partners and friends. We find that, apart from the “kinship” premium, there is a sizeable “intimacy” premium, which together translates into a substantial “family” premium. The study also finds a “friendship premium”, as is documented in various experiments. The closeness of relationships among family and kin, especially close kin, has a significant and large effect on altruism. The results also attest to the importance of the extended family in regards to the “kinship” premium on altruism. These various premiums on altruism emphasise the importance of the supportive role of various social systems. Nevertheless, altruism within families and among close kin might also be enhanced by building more cohesive and stronger families using developmental social welfare programmes.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196175</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:334416b:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Frederik Booysen, Sevias Guvuriro, Alistair Munro, Tshepo Moloi, Celeste Campher&lt;/p&gt;

End-stage renal disease is strongly associated with progressive cardiovascular calcification (CVC) and there is currently no therapy targeted to treat CVC. SNF472 is an experimental formulation under development for treatment of soft tissue calcification. We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of SNF472 administration in rats and its inhibitory effects on CVC. SNF472 was studied in three rat models: (1) prevention of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with an intravenous SNF472 bolus of 1 mg/kg SNF472, (2) inhibition of progression of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with a subcutaneous SNF472 bolus of 10 or 60 mg/kg SNF472, starting after calcification induction, (3) CVC in adenine-induced uremic rats treated with 50 mg/kg SNF472 via i.v. 4h -infusion. Uremic rats presented lower plasma levels of SNF472 than control animals after i.v. infusion. CVC in non-uremic rats was inhibited by 60–70% after treatment with SNF472 and progression of cardiac calcification completely blocked. Development of CVC in uremic rats was inhibited by up to 80% following i.v. infusion of SNF472. SNF472 inhibits the development and progression of CVC in uremic and non-uremic rats in the same range of SNF472 plasma levels but using in each case the required dose to obtain those levels. These results collectively support the development of SNF472 as a novel therapeutic option for treatment of CVC in humans.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197061</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee0:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miguel D.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To investigate whether multi-frequency vibrometry can identify individuals with elevated vibration perception thresholds (VPTs), reflecting impaired vibrotactile sense, among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 72 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes, VPTs were evaluated for seven frequencies on two sites of the hand, and five frequencies on two sites of the foot. Z-scores, based on previously collected reference data, were calculated. Perception to light touch was investigated using monofilaments. Subjects’ characteristics were analyzed in comparison to normal and impaired vibrotactile sense.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Subjects’ median age, disease duration and age at disease onset were 12.8, 5.3 and 6.9 years, respectively. A total of 13 out of 72 (18%) subjects had impaired vibrotactile sense on at least one foot site. Impaired vibrotactile sense was more common among subjects treated with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) compared to subjects treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (p = 0.013). Age at disease onset was higher among subjects with impaired vibrotactile sense (p = 0.046). No significant correlations were found with gender, HbA1c or duration of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Impaired vibrotactile sense, mirroring diabetic peripheral neuropathy, was found in 1/5 of the children and adolescents in the study, and was more common in patients treated with MDI than in subjects treated with CSII.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196243</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f7903:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Erik Ising, Lars B.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Internet-based social networks are used by nurses with different purposes, including the creation of working groups and to share and create knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the utility of social networks in the dissemination of an online questionnaire and to measure Spanish RNs’ knowledge about palliative care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Internet-based social networks are used by nurses with different purposes, including the creation of working groups and to share and create knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the utility of social networks in the dissemination of an online questionnaire and to measure Spanish RNs’ knowledge about palliative care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery programme (ERAS) is an approach to the perioperative care of patients encompassing multiple interventions and involving a wide range of different actors. It can thus be defined as a complex intervention. Despite the strength of the evidence-base in its support, the implementation of ERAS has been slow. This paper specifically explores the utility of Normalization Process Theory (NPT) as a methodological framework to aid exploration of ERAS implementation, with a focus on the core NPT construct &lt;i&gt;coherence&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and materials &lt;p&gt;The study employed qualitative methods guided by NPT. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty-six healthcare professionals working in three specialities (thoracic, colorectal, head and neck) in a UK hospital. Data were analysed using an adapted Framework Approach.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coherence&lt;/i&gt;, or sense-making work, was key to successful implementation and demonstrated in the importance of participants believing in ERAS both as an individual and as a team. In order to invest in ERAS individuals needed to be able to differentiate its practices favourably with those enacted pre-implementation (differentiation). Participants also needed to understand their specific tasks and responsibilities (individual specification) and build a shared understanding (communal specification), resolving differences in planning meetings.

Brain structure and learning capacities both vary with experience, but the mechanistic link between them is unclear. Here, we investigated whether experience-dependent variability in learning performance can be explained by neuroplasticity in foraging honey bees. The mushroom bodies (MBs) are a brain center necessary for ambiguous olfactory learning tasks such as reversal learning. Using radio frequency identification technology, we assessed the effects of natural variation in foraging activity, and the age when first foraging, on both performance in reversal learning and on synaptic connectivity in the MBs. We found that reversal learning performance improved at foraging onset and could decline with greater foraging experience. If bees started foraging before the normal age, as a result of a stress applied to the colony, the decline in learning performance with foraging experience was more severe. Analyses of brain structure in the same bees showed that the total number of synaptic boutons at the MB input decreased when bees started foraging, and then increased with greater foraging intensity. At foraging onset MB structure is therefore optimized for bees to update learned information, but optimization of MB connectivity deteriorates with foraging effort. In a computational model of the MBs sparser coding of information at the MB input improved reversal learning performance. We propose, therefore, a plausible mechanistic relationship between experience, neuroplasticity, and cognitive performance in a natural and ecological context.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196749</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e63:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Amélie Cabirol, Alex J.

Now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(18)30307-3&quot;&gt;here’s another example&lt;/a&gt; of protein fuzziness, and I can’t say that I’d like to take this one on, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gcn4&quot;&gt;Gcn4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MED15&quot;&gt;Med15&lt;/a&gt; are important parts of the the transcriptional machinery in yeast, and this system has many similarities to what’s going on in higher organisms. Gcn4 is a transcription activator, found in large protein complexes where genes are being transcribed, and it has two (disordered) activation domains that recruit all sorts of co-activator proteins. As the paper says, this has long been seen as a case of “acidic blobs” (Gcn4 in this case) and “negative noodles” (proteins like Med15, SAGA, Swi/Snf and many others). Those charge interactions make sense, but not much else does, and the big question has been how these complexes form with any specificity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also been clear, though, that you really need a cloud of these things for transcription. No one single activator-coactivator event is enough. The back half of Med15, for example, has at least three binding domains that can interact with Gcn4, and this sort of multivalency is common. That makes it quite hard to unravel what’s going on in the protein complex, of course. What kind of structure do you have in there? Many of the protein binding regions involved are disordered in the absence of a binding partner, but it’s well known that some of these can form up into very well-defined structures when they encounter each other. Is that what’s happening on a larger scale? Or is it like the situation described in that first paragraph link, where two disordered proteins form a tight interaction &lt;em&gt;while both still remaining disordered&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not quite that latter case, but it’s still disconcerting. This new paper shows that the various protein interaction domains all have low affinity individually (as the more reductionist experiments had shown), and they do not really assemble into something concrete:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our data demonstrate that the presence of multiple binding components leads to a large gain in the affinity of Gcn4-Med15 binding but does not lead to formation of a distinct ordered structure. The functional complex is a dynamic fuzzy ‘‘free-for-all”. . .Our results provide a general model for the mechanism of many activators that functionally bind coactivators with multiple ABDs and demonstrate how multiple weak fuzzy interactions synergize to generate a biologically functional and specific interaction without adopting a unique protein-protein interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear. “Dynamic fuzzy free-for-all” is not the kind of environment that I really feel comfortable tossing small molecules into, but I didn’t get any input into this process. Both of the Gcn4 activator domains bind to all of the Med15 activator-binding domains. A lot of fluorescence polarization work, calorimetry, and NMR data establish that Gcn4’s activator domains do indeed take on helical structure when they’re in the presence of a corresponding Med15 domain, but it’s not that this structure is the nailed-down form of the complex. It can, and does, form the exact same sorts of structures with all the others, and there are several ways that the helices (and the proteins in general) can interact. They’re just bumping around in there sampling every possibility, and the sum of those things is (from a distance) a high-affinity, well-defined protein complex. It’s only as you zoom in closer that you realize that it looks more like a live swarm of bees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, not all transcription activators work this way. There are examples known with specific, defined protein-protein interfaces, more the sort of thing we’re used to. But there are also many cases where a single activator seems to pick up a whole list of (seemingly unrelated) partners, and in those cases, this fuzzy combinatorial mechanism could well be the mode of operation. But for a drug discovery guy like me, the next question, behind the scientific curiosity one, is: is there any way we can target or alter these mechanisms to treat disease? Just figuring out which ones you’d want to target is a major job, and figuring out what sort of alteration you’d want is another. But the biggest job of all is at the end: once you’ve found the spot, and you know what you’d like to do, how do you make one of these fuzzballs do what you want? At the moment, I have no idea. But the night is young.&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Frequent changes in the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) occurring worldwide demand regular surveillance to study their composition and distribution in healthcare facilities. We investigated the genotypic characteristics of MRSA obtained in Kuwait hospitals to better understand their clonal distribution.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,327 MRSA isolates obtained from clinical samples in 13 Kuwait hospitals from 1 January to 31 December 2016 were investigated using antibiogram, SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; typing, spa typing and DNA microarray.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The isolates belonged to six SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; types with the majority belonging to type IV (658; 49.5%) and type V (355; 26.7%). Two hundred and sixty-one spa types were identified with spa types t688, t304, t860, t127, t044, t311, t002, t223, t267, t019, t3841, t005, t084, t852, and t657 constituting 51.0% (n = 677) of the isolates. Among the 1,327 MRSA isolates, 102 (7.68%) isolates were identified as novel variants of internationally recognized MRSA clones. These 102 isolates were investigated further and belonged to 14 clonal complexes (CCs) with CC361 (32; 32.3%), CC30 (15; 14.7%), CC22 (13; 12.7%) and CC1 (11, 10.7%) as the dominant CCs. Eighty-one (79.4%) of the novel isolates harbored SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; IV or V+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt; composite genetic elements. Four isolates (3.9%) harbored unusual combinations of &lt;i&gt;ccr&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; complexes comprising of CC6-MRSA [IV+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrC&lt;/i&gt;], CC97-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB2&lt;/i&gt;], CC121-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrB4&lt;/i&gt;] and CC1-MRSA-pseudoSCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; [class B mec+&lt;i&gt;fusc&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB1&lt;/i&gt;]. Forty-six (45.1%) of these isolates were positive for PVL and 89 (87.2%) were resistant to fusidic acid mediated by &lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The study showed the emergence of novel variants of previously recognized MRSA genotypes with unusual genetic characteristics including high prevalence of PVL and fusidic acid resistance in Kuwait hospitals.

The Hedgehog family of morphogens has long been known to utilize, through the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), the heterotrimeric G protein G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in both canonical and noncanonical forms of signaling. Other G proteins, while not specifically utilized by Smo, may nonetheless provide access to some of the events controlled by it. We reported several years ago that the G protein G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; activates one or more forms of the Gli family of transcription factors. While the Gli transcription factors are well known targets for Smo, the uncertain mechanism of activation by G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and the identity of the targeted Gli(s) limited predictions as to the extent to which G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; might mimic Smo’s actions. We evaluate here the potential for overlap in G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and Smo signaling using C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 cells as models of osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively. We find in C3H10T1/2 cells that a constitutively active form of Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; (Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL) increases Gli1 mRNA, as does a constitutively active form of Smo (SmoA1). We find as well that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL induces alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteogenesis, albeit the induction is far less substantial than that achieved by SmoA1. In 3T3-L1 cells both Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 markedly suppress adipogenic differentiation as determined by triglyceride accumulation.

The Hedgehog family of morphogens has long been known to utilize, through the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), the heterotrimeric G protein G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in both canonical and noncanonical forms of signaling. Other G proteins, while not specifically utilized by Smo, may nonetheless provide access to some of the events controlled by it. We reported several years ago that the G protein G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; activates one or more forms of the Gli family of transcription factors. While the Gli transcription factors are well known targets for Smo, the uncertain mechanism of activation by G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and the identity of the targeted Gli(s) limited predictions as to the extent to which G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; might mimic Smo’s actions. We evaluate here the potential for overlap in G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and Smo signaling using C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 cells as models of osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively. We find in C3H10T1/2 cells that a constitutively active form of Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; (Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL) increases Gli1 mRNA, as does a constitutively active form of Smo (SmoA1). We find as well that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL induces alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteogenesis, albeit the induction is far less substantial than that achieved by SmoA1. In 3T3-L1 cells both Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 markedly suppress adipogenic differentiation as determined by triglyceride accumulation. RNA sequencing reveals that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 regulate many of the same genes but that quantitative and qualitative differences exist. Differences also exist, we find, between SmoA1 and purmorphamine, an agonist for Smo. Therefore, while comparisons of constitutively active proteins are informative, extrapolations to the setting of agonists require care.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24922-x</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/uxpYbWLTPrc/s41598-018-24922-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Krutika Bavishi</name></author><published>1525158000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Direct observation of multiple conformational states in Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and their modulation by membrane environment and ionic strength</title><crawled>1525166379947</crawled><fingerprint>109e9583</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24922-x</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct observation of multiple conformational states in Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and their modulation by membrane environment and ionic strength&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct observation of multiple conformational states in Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and their modulation by membrane environment and ionic strength, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24922-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24922-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Direct observation of multiple conformational states in Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and their modulation by membrane environment and ionic strength&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/uxpYbWLTPrc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1631b0013ab:23a759d:11c251fd</id><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct observation of multiple conformational states in Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and their modulation by membrane environment and ionic strength&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct observation of multiple conformational states in Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and their modulation by membrane environment and ionic strength, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24922-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24922-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Direct observation of multiple conformational states in Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and their modulation by membrane environment and ionic strength&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/uxpYbWLTPrc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24922-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4887.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4887</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/19.cover-source.jpg?itok=gY78Iz1p</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>359</width></visual><author><name>Thijs Bol, Mathijs de Vaan, Arnout van de Rijt</name></author><published>1525803378000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>The Matthew effect in science funding [Social Sciences]</title><crawled>1525807602634</crawled><fingerprint>f12934bc</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4887.short?rss=1</originId><description>A classic thesis is that scientific achievement exhibits a “Matthew effect”: Scientists who have previously been successful are more likely to succeed again, producing increasing distinction.

Copper-64 is an attractive radionuclide for PET imaging and is frequently used in clinical applications. The aim of this study was to perform a side-by-side comparison of the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; performance of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (NODAGA = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid,4,7-acetic acid, JR11 = p-Cl-Phe-cyclo(D-Cys-Aph(Hor)-D-Aph(cbm)-Lys-Thr-Cys)D-Tyr-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist, with the clinically used sst2 agonist &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE ((TATE = D-Phe-cyclo(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys)Thr). &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies demonstrated K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; values of 5.7±0.95 nM (Bmax = 4.1±0.18 nM) for the antagonist &lt;sup&gt;64/nat&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 and 20.1±4.4. nM (Bmax = 0.48±0.18 nM) for the agonist &lt;sup&gt;64/nat&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE. Cell uptake studies showed the expected differences between agonists and antagonists. Whereas &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE (the agonist) showed very effective internalization in the cell culture assay (with 50% internalized at 4 hours post-peptide addition under the given experimental conditions), &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (the antagonist) showed little internalization but strong receptor-mediated uptake at the cell membrane. Biodistribution studies of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Specificity of tumor uptake was proven by co-injection of high excess of non-radiolabeled peptide, which led to &gt;80% tumor blocking. &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE showed less favorable pharmacokinetics, with the exception of lower kidney uptake. Blood clearance was distinctly slower and persistent higher blood values were found at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and lung was relatively high and also persistent. The tumor uptake was specific and similar to that of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 at 1 h, but release from the tumor was very fast, particularly between 4 and 24 hours. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios were distinctly lower after 1 hour. This is indicative of insufficient &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; stability. PET studies of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 reflected the biodistribution data with nicely delineated tumor and low background. &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 shows promising pharmacokinetic properties for further translation into the clinic.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195802</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe31:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Svetlana N.

These reactions have a lot of variables in them and can be notoriously finicky about what combination of these will actually give decent amounts of product. At the same time, it appears that almost any given metal-catalyzed coupling reaction is capable of being optimized, if you care enough. So this is a good field for both miniaturized reaction searching (as in the link above) and for machine learning (as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/186&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s going after what’s often an even more challenging case, the C-N &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchwald%E2%80%93Hartwig_amination&quot;&gt;Buchwald-Hartwig&lt;/a&gt; coupling. That one gets used a lot in medicinal chemistry (we like nitrogen atoms), but it’s also a well-known beast when it comes to variation in yield. You can honestly never be quite sure that it’s going to work well when you set it up on a new system for the first time, because there are a lot of conditions (solvent, catalyst, additives) to pick from, and often very little guidance about which region of reaction space is going to be most fruitful. This work, a Princeton/Merck collaboration, is an attempt to calculate a way out of the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the two approaches mentioned in the first paragraph are not an either/or case. Far from it. If you’re going to do machine learning, you’re going to need a lot of reliable data (positive and negative) to feed into the model, and how better to generate that than in an automated, high-throughput setup? That’s especially true as you start adding in more reaction variables: every one of those can increase the complexity of the machine learning model in an exponential fashion, and stuff gets out of control quickly under those conditions. So the question is, can ML provide something useful here, and can it outperform the simpler-to-implement regression models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d definitely want robotic help up front: the data set was the yields from 4,608 coupling reactions  (15 aryl or heteroaryl halides, 4 ligands, 3 bases, and 23 isoxazole additives). About 30% of the reactions gave no product at all – valuable fodder for the model – and the rest were spread in a wide range from “pretty darn good” to “truly crappy”. Just what you need. At this point, you need to figure out just what you’re going to tell the system about these reactions (a nontrivial decision). Too few (or wrongly chosen) parameters, and you’ll never get a useful model. Too many, and you risk an overfitted model that looks good from a distance but is both hard to implement and still not robust. In this case, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartan_(software)&quot;&gt;Spartan&lt;/a&gt; program &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/02/14/science.aar5169.DC1/aar5169-Ahenman-SM_revision_1.pdf&quot;&gt;is used to provide&lt;/a&gt; atomic, molecular, and vibrational descriptors of the substrate(s), catalysts, bases, and additives. So what goes in are electrostatics at various atoms, vibrational modes (frequencies and intensities), dipole moments, electronegativity, surface areas, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the team took 70% of the data as a training set to see if they could predict the outcomes in the other 30%, and ran the data through a whole set of possibilities: linear and polynomial regression for starters, then k-nearest neighbors, Bayes-generalized linear models, layered neural networks, random-forest techniques, etc. Only when they got to that last two did they start to see real predictive value, and random-forest seems to have been the clear winner. Its predictions, even using only 5% of the data, were better than linear-regression models tuned up on the whole 70%. But even so, there were limits. “Activity cliffs” are always a problem in these reactions, and those are hard to pick up (even with 4,608 reactions to train on!) The wider the range of chemical/reaction space you’re trying to cover with your model, the better the chance you’re going to miss these things (and the better the chance you’re going to end up with an overfitted model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way out of that is to restrict your question to a narrower region of potential reactions (and thus get more fine detail into the model). But that, naturally, makes it less useful: after all, the dream is a Buchwald-Hartwig Box, where you walk up, draw the structures of your two reactants (no matter what they might be), and it pauses for a moment and spits out a set of good reaction conditions. That’s. . .still a little ways off. But I do have to say that this current effort beats both human intuition (insofar as anyone has any about these reactions) and other attempts to calculate likely starting points. So it is a real improvement, and the finding that random-forest techniques outperformed everything else is worth building on, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group did try putting in some additives that were not in the training set at all, to see how the model would handle them. And the answer is “not bad”: the root-mean-square error in predicted yields for the original test set versus reference set was about 8%, and the RMSE for the new additive set was about 11%. So it was not quite as good, but on the right track. (By comparison, the single-layer neural network model had about a 10% error on the original set, while the other methods came in at 15 to 16%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggested a look at the final random-forest procedure to see if there was anything that could be learned about the mechanism (a tall order, from what I know about the field). Some of the most important descriptors were things like electrostatic charge on the isoxazole additive’s atoms, its calculated LUMO, and its carbon NMR shifts. That suggests that the additive’s electrophilic behavior was important, but those parameters taken by themselves weren’t enough to produce any kind of useful model on their own. Still, a check of isoxazoles from both ends of the scale suggested that the more electrophilic ones were capable of undergoing a side reaction with the Pd catalyst that reduced yields, which may well be what the model was picking up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’d say that this paper does show (as have some others) that machine-learning techniques are going to help us out eventually in predicting reaction conditions, even if that day has not quite arrived. When you get down to it, the parameters going into this model are not particularly complicated, so it may well be a good sign that it’s worked as well as it has. You’d have to think that larger data sets and new inputs can only going to make these things perform better (after plenty of human effort and care, of course), and that’s leaving aside the general possibility of improved algorithms. I think we’ll get there, but we’re not there now.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196995</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196995</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Chung Hyun Cho</name></author><published>1525813200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Plastid genome analysis of three Nemaliophycidae red algal species suggests environmental adaptation for iron limited habitats</title><updated>1525813200000</updated><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><fingerprint>87aad8d7</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196995</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chung Hyun Cho, Ji Won Choi, Daryl W.

The red algal subclass Nemaliophycidae includes both marine and freshwater taxa that contribute to more than half of the freshwater species in Rhodophyta. Given that these taxa inhabit diverse habitats, the Nemaliophycidae is a suitable model for studying environmental adaptation. For this purpose, we characterized plastid genomes of two freshwater species, &lt;i&gt;Kumanoa americana&lt;/i&gt; (Batrachospermales) and &lt;i&gt;Thorea hispida&lt;/i&gt; (Thoreales), and one marine species &lt;i&gt;Palmaria palmata&lt;/i&gt; (Palmariales). Comparative genome analysis identified seven genes (&lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;46, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;91, &lt;i&gt;grx&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A) that were different among marine and freshwater species. Among currently available red algal plastid genomes (127), four genes (&lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37) were retained in most of the marine species. Among these, the &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A gene, known for encoding heme oxygenase, had two additional copies (&lt;i&gt;HMOX1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HMOX2&lt;/i&gt;) that were newly discovered and were reported from previously red algal nuclear genomes. Each type of heme oxygenase had a different evolutionary history and special modifications (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., plastid targeting signal peptide). Based on this observation, we suggest that the plastid-encoded &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A contributes to the iron controlling system in iron-deprived conditions. Thus, we highlight that this functional requirement may have prevented gene loss during the long evolutionary history of red algal plastid genomes.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196995</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475061:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chung Hyun Cho, Ji Won Choi, Daryl W.

For this purpose, we characterized plastid genomes of two freshwater species, &lt;i&gt;Kumanoa americana&lt;/i&gt; (Batrachospermales) and &lt;i&gt;Thorea hispida&lt;/i&gt; (Thoreales), and one marine species &lt;i&gt;Palmaria palmata&lt;/i&gt; (Palmariales). Comparative genome analysis identified seven genes (&lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;46, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;91, &lt;i&gt;grx&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A) that were different among marine and freshwater species. Among currently available red algal plastid genomes (127), four genes (&lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37) were retained in most of the marine species. Among these, the &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A gene, known for encoding heme oxygenase, had two additional copies (&lt;i&gt;HMOX1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HMOX2&lt;/i&gt;) that were newly discovered and were reported from previously red algal nuclear genomes. Each type of heme oxygenase had a different evolutionary history and special modifications (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., plastid targeting signal peptide). Based on this observation, we suggest that the plastid-encoded &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A contributes to the iron controlling system in iron-deprived conditions. Thus, we highlight that this functional requirement may have prevented gene loss during the long evolutionary history of red algal plastid genomes.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03975-6</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/2URCZOPDmIA/s41467-018-03975-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Alexander Bläßle</name></author><published>1524207600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Quantitative diffusion measurements using the open-source software PyFRAP</title><crawled>1524215355079</crawled><fingerprint>de33620f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03975-6</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quantitative diffusion measurements using the open-source software PyFRAP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantitative diffusion measurements using the open-source software PyFRAP, Published online: 20 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03975-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03975-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;FRAP analysis often relies on simplified assumptions that can affect measurement accuracy.

REEs in the environment can be absorbed by plants and sequestered by plant phytoliths. Acid rain can directly or indirectly affect plant physiological functions. Currently, the effects of REEs and acid rain on phytolith-REEs complex in plants are not yet fully understood. In this study, a high-silicon accumulation crop, rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.), was selected as a representative of plants, and orthogonal experiments were conducted under various levels of lanthanum [La(III)] and pH. The results showed that various La(III) concentrations could significantly improve the efficiency and sequestration of phytolith La(III) in germinated rice seeds. A pH of 4.5 promoted phytolith La(III) sequestration, while a pH of 3.5 inhibited sequestration. Compared with the single treatment with La(III), the combination of La(III) and acid rain inhibited the efficiency and sequestration of phytolith La(III). Correlation analysis showed that the efficiency of phytolith La(III) sequestration had no correlation with the production of phytolith but was closely correlated with the sequestration of phytolith La(III) and the physiological changes of germinated rice seeds. Phytolith morphology was an important factor affecting phytolith La(III) sequestration in germinated rice seeds, and the effect of tubes on sequestration was more significant than that of dumbbells. This study demonstrated that the formation of the phytolith and La(III) complex could be affected by exogenous La(III) and acid rain in germinated rice seeds.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197365</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b83:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yong Si, Lihong Wang, Qing Zhou, Xiaohua Huang&lt;/p&gt;

To reproduce experimental structural and kinetic properties of assembly, a process occurring on the order of minutes, a coarse-grained representation consisting of a single particle per Gag molecule is developed. The model uses information relating the functional interfaces implicated in Gag assembly, results from cryo electron-tomography, and biophysical measurements from fluorescence microscopy, such as the dynamics of Gag assembly at single virions. These experimental constraints eliminated many classes of potential interactions, and narrowed the model to a single interaction scheme with two non-equivalent interfaces acting to form Gags into a hexamer, and a third interface acting to link hexamers together. This model was able to form into a hexameric structure with correct lattice spacing and reproduced biologically relevant growth rates. We explored the effect of genomic RNA seeding punctum growth, finding that RNA may be a factor in locally concentrating Gags to initiate assembly. The simulation results infer that completion of assembly cannot be governed simply by Gag binding kinetics. However the addition of membrane curvature suggests that budding of the virion from the plasma membrane could factor into slowing incorporation of Gag at an assembly site resulting in virions of the same size and number of Gag molecules independent of Gag concentration or the time taken to complete assembly. To corroborate the results of our simulation model, we developed an analytic model for Gag assembly finding good agreement with the simulation results.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196133</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e802:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael D.

Transcription control plays a crucial role in establishing a unique gene expression signature for each of the hundreds of mammalian cell types. Though gene expression data has been widely used to infer the cellular regulatory networks, the methods mainly infer correlations rather than causality. We propose that a causal inference framework successfully used for eQTL data can be extended to infer causal regulatory networks using enhancers as causal anchors and enhancer RNA expression as a readout of enhancer activity. Results: We developed statistical models and likelihood-ratio tests to infer causal gene regulatory networks using enhancer RNA (eRNA) expression information as a causal anchor and applied the framework to eRNA and transcript expression data from the FANTOM consortium. Predicted causal targets of transcription factors (TFs) in mouse embryonic stem cells, macrophages and erythroblastic leukemia overlapped significantly with experimentally validated targets from ChIP-seq and perturbation data. We further improved the model by taking into account that some TFs might act in a quantitative, dosage-dependent manner, whereas others might act predominantly in a binary on/off fashion. We predicted TF targets from concerted variation of eRNA and TF and target promoter expression levels within a single cell type as well as across multiple cell types. Importantly, TFs with high-confidence predictions were largely different between these two analyses, demonstrating that variability within a cell type is highly relevant for target prediction of cell type specific factors. Finally, we generated a compendium of high-confidence TF targets across diverse human cell and tissue types.

This strategy allows instant retrieval of popular proteins across the human &amp;quot;diseasome&amp;quot;, and further allows reverse queries from protein to disease, enabling functional analysis of experimental protein lists using bibliometric annotations.</content></content><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197322</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197322</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Hwa Sun Kim</name></author><published>1525899600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 enhances rod survival in the &amp;lt;i&gt;rd1&amp;lt;/i&gt; mouse retina</title><updated>1525899600000</updated><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><fingerprint>27e265bd</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197322</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hwa Sun Kim, Andrew Vargas, Yun Sung Eom, Justin Li, Kyra L.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited retinal degenerative disease, is characterized by a progressive loss of rod photoreceptors followed by loss of cone photoreceptors. Previously, when tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), a key extracellular matrix (ECM) regulator that binds to and inhibits activation of Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) was intravitreal injected into eyes of a transgenic rhodopsin rat model of RP, S334ter-line3, we discovered cone outer segments are partially protected. In parallel, we reported that a specific MMP9 and MMP2 inhibitor, SB-3CT, interferes with mechanisms leading to rod photoreceptor cell death in an MMP9 dependent manner. Here, we extend our initial rat studies to examine the potential of TIMP1 as a treatment in retinal degeneration by investigating neuroprotective effects in a classic mouse retinal degeneration model, &lt;i&gt;rd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Pde6b-/-&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt;). The results clearly demonstrate that intravitreal injections of TIMP1 produce extended protection to delay rod photoreceptor cell death. The mean total number of rods in whole-mount retinas was significantly greater in TIMP-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P35 (P&amp;lt;0.0001) and P45 (P&amp;lt;0.05) than in saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas. In contrast, SB-3CT did not delay rod cell death, leading us to further investigate alternative pathways that do not involve MMPs. In addition to inducing phosphorylated ERK1/2, TIMP1 significantly reduces BAX activity and delays attenuation of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Physiological responses using scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) reveal b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated retinas are significantly greater than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). In later degenerative stages of &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas, photopic b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas are significantly larger than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05).

Background &lt;p&gt;Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8) can cause Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) in immunosuppressed individuals. However, little is known about the association between chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), circulating HHV8 DNA levels, and clinical KS in HIV-1-infected individuals with various malignancies. Therefore, we examined the associations between various malignancies, systemic cancer chemotherapy, T cell phenotypes, and circulating HHV8 DNA in 29 HIV-1-infected participants with concomitant KS or other cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We quantified HHV8 plasma viral loads and cell-associated HHV8 DNA and determined the relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and lymphocyte counts, and markers of early and late lymphocyte activation, proliferation and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences in plasma HHV8 DNA levels between baseline and post-chemotherapy time points or with the presence or absence of clinical KS. However, in two participants circulating HHV8 DNA increased following treatment for KS or HSCT for lymphoma,. We observed an approximately 2-log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in plasma HHV8 DNA in an individual with KS and multicentric Castleman disease following rituximab monotherapy. Although individuals with clinical KS had lower mean CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell counts and percentages as expected, there were no significant associations with these factors and plasma HHV8 levels. We identified increased proportions of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells expressing CD69 (P = 0.01 &amp;amp; P = 0.04 respectively), and increased CD57 expression on CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells (P = 0.003) in participants with detectable HHV8.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest there is a complex relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and tissue-based disease in HIV-1 and HHV8 co-infected individuals with various malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197298</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915e:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Louise E.

We identified increased proportions of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells expressing CD69 (P = 0.01 &amp;amp; P = 0.04 respectively), and increased CD57 expression on CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells (P = 0.003) in participants with detectable HHV8.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest there is a complex relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and tissue-based disease in HIV-1 and HHV8 co-infected individuals with various malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21308-x</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/p2by2VoXHzU/s41598-018-21308-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>E.

Dimensionality reduction of microarray data is a very challenging task due to high computational time and the large amount of memory required to train and test a model. Genetic programming (GP) is a stochastic approach to solving a problem. For high dimensional datasets, GP does not perform as well as other machine learning algorithms. To explore the inherent property of GP to generalize models from low dimensional data, we need to consider dimensionality reduction approaches. Random projections (RPs) have gained attention for reducing the dimensionality of data with reduced computational cost, compared to other dimensionality reduction approaches. We report that the features constructed from RPs perform extremely well when combined with a GP approach. We used eight datasets out of which seven have not been reported as being used in any machine learning research before. We have also compared our results by using the same full and constructed features for decision trees, random forest, naive Bayes, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbor methods.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196385</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d747:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hassan Tariq, Elf Eldridge, Ian Welch&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, they have also been used to address the accuracy of force fields for various organic compounds and specifically the methylated DNA bases. In this study, atomic charges were derived by different partitioning methods (Hirshfeld and Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder) directly from the electron density obtained by electronic structure calculations in a vacuum, with an implicit solvation model or with explicit solvation taking the dynamics of the solute and the solvent into account. To test the ability of these charges to describe electrostatic interactions in force fields for condensed phases, the original atomic charges of the AMBER99 force field were replaced with the new atomic charges and combined with different solvent models to obtain the hydration and chloroform solvation free energies by molecular dynamics simulations.

Recently, they have also been used to address the accuracy of force fields for various organic compounds and specifically the methylated DNA bases. In this study, atomic charges were derived by different partitioning methods (Hirshfeld and Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder) directly from the electron density obtained by electronic structure calculations in a vacuum, with an implicit solvation model or with explicit solvation taking the dynamics of the solute and the solvent into account. To test the ability of these charges to describe electrostatic interactions in force fields for condensed phases, the original atomic charges of the AMBER99 force field were replaced with the new atomic charges and combined with different solvent models to obtain the hydration and chloroform solvation free energies by molecular dynamics simulations. Chloroform–water partition coefficients derived from the obtained free energies were compared to experimental and previously reported values obtained with the GAFF or the AMBER‐99 force field.

Besides GRN-driven landscapes of cellular dynamics, the algorithm proposed can also be applied to studies of global dynamics of other dynamical systems.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05171-4</link><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05171-4/d41586-018-05171-4_15761718.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>Sara Reardon</name></author><published>1526454000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Geoscience society rescinds award to top seismologist after ethics investigation</title><crawled>1526487156942</crawled><fingerprint>f5724856</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05171-4</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geoscience society rescinds award to top seismologist after ethics investigation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geoscience society rescinds award to top seismologist after ethics investigation, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05171-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05171-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The American Geophysical Union says it received a ‘conduct-related complaint’ against Thomas Jordan.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05171-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16369b988ce:413ea9c:3dd877af</id><engagementRate>1.63</engagementRate><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geoscience society rescinds award to top seismologist after ethics investigation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geoscience society rescinds award to top seismologist after ethics investigation, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05171-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05171-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The American Geophysical Union says it received a ‘conduct-related complaint’ against Thomas Jordan.</content></content><engagement>152</engagement></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00674</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/qYIvLY0-IIo/acs.jpcb.8b00674</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Xuan Leng, Ya-Ming Yan, Rui-Dan Zhu, Kai Song, Yu-Xiang Weng, Qiang Shi</name></author><published>1524024000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00674/20180418/images/medium/jp-2018-006743_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00674&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Results: We present ngsReports, an R package designed for the management and visualization of NGS reports from within an R environment. The available methods allow direct import into R of FastQC output as well as that from aligners such as HISAT2, STAR and Bowtie2. Visualization can be carried out across many samples using heatmaps rendered using ggplot2 and plotly. Moreover, these can be displayed in an interactive shiny app or a HTML report. We also provide methods to assess observed GC content in an organism dependent manner for both transcriptomic and genomic datasets.

Results: We introduce FAVITES, a robust framework for simulating realistic datasets for epidemics that are caused by fast-evolving pathogens like HIV. FAVITES creates a generative model that produces many items relevant to an epidemic, such as contact networks, transmission networks, phylogenetic trees, and error-prone sequence datasets. FAVITES is designed to be flexible and extensible by dividing the generative model into modules, each of which is expressed as a fixed API that can be implemented using various sub-models. We use FAVITES to simulate HIV datasets resembling the San Diego epidemic and show that the simulated datasets are realistic. We then use the simulated data to make inferences about the epidemic and how it is impacted by increased treatment efforts. We also study two transmission network reconstruction methods and their effectiveness in detecting fast-growing clusters.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several specialty societies participate in the Choosing Wisely (CW) campaign in an attempt to reduce waste in health care spending.

A 10-question, case-based multiple choice test, with each question accompanied by a 5-point Likert-scale confidence assessment, was distributed electronically. Responses were summarized with frequencies and percentages or medians and ranges, as appropriate. Two sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare confidence and knowledge scores.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 892 IM residents, 174 (19.5%) responded to all questions. Overall, residents answered a median of 7 of 10 questions correctly (range 2–10) and median resident confidence in their responses was 3.1 (on a 5-point scale). Correct responses were significantly associated with higher confidence for all but one question. Having a hematology rotation experience was significantly associated with more correct responses and with higher confidence (&lt;i&gt;p = 0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt;, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;IM residents at several academic hospitals have variable knowledge of ASH-CW guidelines in thrombosis and hemostasis/non-malignant hematology.

Public transport (PT) is a key element in most major cities around the world. With the development of smartphones, available journey planning information is becoming an integral part of the PT system. Each traveler has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, and these preferences can also be reflected on the smartphone. This paper considers transit assignment in urban public-transport networks in which the passengers receive smartphone-based information containing elements that might influence the travel decisions in relation to line loads, as well as passenger benefits, and the paper discusses the transition from the current widespread choosing approach to a personalized decision-making approach based on smartphone information. The approach associated with smartphone guidance that considers passengers’ preference on travel time, waiting time and transfer is proposed in the process of obtaining his/her preferred route from the potential travel routes generated by the Deep First Search (DFS) method. Two other approaches, based on the scenarios reflecting reality, include passengers with access to no real time information, and passengers that only have access to the arrival time at the platform are used as comparisons. For illustration, the same network proposed by Spiess and Florian is utilized on the experiments in an agent-based model. Two experiments are conducted respectively according to whether each passenger’s choosing method is consistent. As expected, the results in the first experiment showed that the travel for consistent passengers with smartphone guidance was clearly shorter and that it can reduce travel time exceeding 15% and weighted cost exceeding 20%, and the average saved time approximated 3.88 minutes per passenger.

Public transport (PT) is a key element in most major cities around the world. With the development of smartphones, available journey planning information is becoming an integral part of the PT system. Each traveler has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, and these preferences can also be reflected on the smartphone. This paper considers transit assignment in urban public-transport networks in which the passengers receive smartphone-based information containing elements that might influence the travel decisions in relation to line loads, as well as passenger benefits, and the paper discusses the transition from the current widespread choosing approach to a personalized decision-making approach based on smartphone information. The approach associated with smartphone guidance that considers passengers’ preference on travel time, waiting time and transfer is proposed in the process of obtaining his/her preferred route from the potential travel routes generated by the Deep First Search (DFS) method. Two other approaches, based on the scenarios reflecting reality, include passengers with access to no real time information, and passengers that only have access to the arrival time at the platform are used as comparisons. For illustration, the same network proposed by Spiess and Florian is utilized on the experiments in an agent-based model. Two experiments are conducted respectively according to whether each passenger’s choosing method is consistent. As expected, the results in the first experiment showed that the travel for consistent passengers with smartphone guidance was clearly shorter and that it can reduce travel time exceeding 15% and weighted cost exceeding 20%, and the average saved time approximated 3.88 minutes per passenger. The second experiment presented that travel cost, as well as cost savings, gradually decreased by employing smartphone guidance, and the maximum cost savings accounted for 14.2% of the total weighted cost.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/437/eaap9840?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/437/eaap9840.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Liu, D., Wong, C.

The best predictor of IA was AspICU algorithm (AUC, 1) followed by serum galactomannan antigen (GM) cut-off (≥1.24) calculated based on AspICU algorithm (AUC, 0.822). For 37% of patients, IA diagnoses was made earlier with serum GM than radiology.

MiRNA molecules are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the brain function. Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of Aβ in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ, and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196929</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475056:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Higaki, Masashi Muramatsu, Akio Matsuda, Kenji Matsumoto, Jun-ichi Satoh, Makoto Michikawa, Shumpei Niida&lt;/p&gt;

Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4340.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4340</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/19/E4340/F1.medium.gif</url><height>290</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width></visual><author><name>Simon J.

Adult height is determined by both genetic characteristics and environmental factors in early life. Although previous studies have suggested that adult height is associated with risk of mortality, comprehensive associations between height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the Japanese population are unclear. We aimed to evaluate the associations between adult height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among Japanese men and women in a prospective cohort study. We investigated 107,794 participants (50,755 men and 57,039 women) aged 40 to 69 years who responded to the baseline questionnaire in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Participants were classified by quartile of adult height obtained from a self-reported questionnaire in men (&amp;lt;160cm, 160-163cm, 164-167cm, ≥168cm) and women (&amp;lt;149cm, 149-151cm, 152-155cm, ≥156cm). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality from all-cause, cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other cause mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. During follow-up, 12,320 men and 7,030 women died. Taller adult height was associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.83 (0.69–0.99); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.90–0.99)) and respiratory disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.69–1.03); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.87–0.97)), but was also associated with increased risk for overall cancer mortality (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.17 (1.07–1.28); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.04 (1.01–1.07)) in men. Taller adult height was also associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;149cm vs. ≥156cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.66–1.05); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.86–0.99)) in women.

Extensive antibiotic use over the years has led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to public health since for many infections antibiotic treatment is no longer effective. Hospitals are focal points for ARB spread. Antibiotic use in hospitals exerts selective pressure, accelerating the spread of ARB. We used an agent-based model to explore the impact of antibiotics on the transmission dynamics and to examine the potential of stewardship interventions in limiting ARB spread in a hospital. Agents in the model consist of patients and health care workers (HCW). The transmission of ARB occurs through contacts between patients and HCW and between adjacent patients. In the model, antibiotic use affects the risk of transmission by increasing the vulnerability of susceptible patients and the contagiousness of colonized patients who are treated with antibiotics. The model shows that increasing the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics increases the rate of acquisition non-linearly. The effect of antibiotics on the spread of resistance depends on characteristics of the antibiotic agent and the density of antibiotic use. Antibiotic&apos;s impact on the spread increases when the bacterial strain is more transmissible, and decreases as resistance prevalence rises. The individual risk for acquiring ARB increases in parallel with antibiotic density both for patients treated and not treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment in the hospital setting plays an important role in determining the spread of resistance. Interventions to limit antibiotic use have the potential to reduce the spread of resistance, mainly by choosing an agent with a favorable profile in terms of its impact on patient&apos;s vulnerability and contagiousness. Methods to measure these impacts of antibiotics should be developed, standardized, and incorporated into drug development programs and approval packages.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197111</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a2198:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonatan Almagor, Elizabeth Temkin, Itzhak Benenson, Noga Fallach, Yehuda Carmeli, on behalf of the DRIVE-AB consortium &lt;/p&gt;

Neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are apicobasally elongated and densely packed in the developing brain, systematically move their nuclei/somata in a cell cycle–dependent manner, called interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM): apical during G2 and basal during G1. Although intracellular molecular mechanisms of individual IKNM have been explored, how heterogeneous IKNMs are collectively coordinated is unknown. Our quantitative cell-biological and in silico analyses revealed that tissue elasticity mechanically assists an initial step of basalward IKNM. When the soma of an M-phase progenitor cell rounds up using actomyosin within the subapical space, a microzone within 10 μm from the surface, which is compressed and elastic because of the apical surface’s contractility, laterally pushes the densely neighboring processes of non–M-phase cells. The pressed processes then recoil centripetally and basally to propel the nuclei/somata of the progenitor’s daughter cells. Thus, indirect neighbor-assisted transfer of mechanical energy from mother to daughter helps efficient brain development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QIHSf4hXHfg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162e4278028:4dbf10:76251cdd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoyasu Shinoda, Arata Nagasaka, Yasuhiro Inoue, Ryo Higuchi, Yoshiaki Minami, Kagayaki Kato, Makoto Suzuki, Takefumi Kondo, Takumi Kawaue, Kanako Saito, Naoto Ueno, Yugo Fukazawa, Masaharu Nagayama, Takashi Miura, Taiji Adachi, Takaki Miyata&lt;/p&gt;
