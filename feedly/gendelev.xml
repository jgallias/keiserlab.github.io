Background &lt;p&gt;Musculoskeletal complaints and injuries (MSCI) are common in military populations. However, only a limited number of studies have followed soldiers during international deployments and investigated the prevalence of MSCI during and at the end of their deployment. The aim was to describe the prevalence of MSCI in different military occupational specialties and categorise their most common tasks in terms of exposures to physical workloads during a six-month long international deployment in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey, including 325 soldiers (300 men), aged 20–62 participating in an international deployment in Afghanistan during the spring of 2012. Soldiers were clustered into different military occupational specialties: Infantry, Administration, Logistics, Logistics/Camp, Medical and Other. Data were collected through the use of the Musculoskeletal Screening Protocol at the end of the international mission.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven percent reported MSCI during deployment, with 28% at the end.The most common locations of MSCI during the mission were lower back, knee, shoulders, upper back, neck and foot, while the knee and lower back prevailed at the end of the mission. Almost half of the soldiers who had MSCI reported affected work ability. The most common duties during the mission were vehicle patrolling, staff duties, guard/security duties, foot patrols and transportation. Soldiers reported that vehicle patrolling, staff duties and transportation were demanding with respect to endurance strength, guard/security duties challenged both maximum and endurance strength while foot patrolling challenged maximum and endurance strength, aerobic and anaerobic endurance and speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MSCI during international deployment are common among Swedish soldiers. The results indicate the need to further develop strategies focusing on matching the soldiers’ capacity to the job requirements, with relevant and fair physical selection-tests during the recruitment process and proactive interventions targeting MSCI before and during deployment, in order to enhance soldiers’ readiness and promote operational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195548</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73f:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandra Halvarsson, Ingela Hagman, Matthias Tegern, Lisbet Broman, Helena Larsson&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Body Mass Index (BMI), like most human phenotypes, is substantially heritable. However, BMI is not normally distributed; the skew appears to be structural, and increases as a function of age. Moreover, twin correlations for BMI commonly violate the assumptions of the most common variety of the classical twin model, with the MZ twin correlation greater than twice the DZ correlation. This study aimed to decompose twin correlations for BMI using more general skew-t distributions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Same sex MZ and DZ twin pairs (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 7,086) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry were included. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to decompose twin correlations for BMI into multiple mixture distributions. LPA was performed using the default normal mixture distribution and the skew-t mixture distribution. Similar analyses were performed for height as a comparison. Our analyses are then replicated in an independent dataset.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A two-class solution under the skew-t mixture distribution fits the BMI distribution for both genders. The first class consists of a relatively normally distributed, highly heritable BMI with a mean in the normal range. The second class is a positively skewed BMI in the overweight and obese range, with lower twin correlations. In contrast, height is normally distributed, highly heritable, and is well-fit by a single latent class. Results in the replication dataset were highly similar.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that two distinct processes underlie the skew of the BMI distribution. The contrast between height and weight is in accord with subjective psychological experience: both are under obvious genetic influence, but BMI is also subject to behavioral control, whereas height is not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194968</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424d:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siny Tsang, Glen E.

The current work examined the unique contribution that autistic traits and social anxiety have on tasks examining attention and emotion processing. In Study 1, 119 typically-developing college students completed a flanker task assessing the control of attention to target faces and away from distracting faces during emotion identification. In Study 2, 208 typically-developing college students performed a visual search task which required identification of whether a series of 8 or 16 emotional faces depicted the same or different emotions. Participants with more self-reported autistic traits performed more slowly on the flanker task in Study 1 than those with fewer autistic traits when stimuli depicted complex emotions. In Study 2, participants higher in social anxiety performed less accurately on trials showing all complex faces; participants with autistic traits showed no differences. These studies suggest that traits related to autism and to social anxiety differentially impact social cognitive processing.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195239</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde2f:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cheryl L.

Initial computational approaches to transfer knowledge across species have relied on measures of heredity such as genetic homology, but these approaches suffer from limitations. First, only a small subset of genes have homologs, limiting the amount of knowledge that can be transferred, and second, genes change or repurpose functions, complicating the transfer of knowledge. Many approaches address this problem by expanding the notion of homology by leveraging high-throughput genomic and proteomic measurements, such as through network alignment. In this work, we take a new approach to transferring knowledge across species by expanding the notion of homology through explicit measures of functional similarity between proteins in different species. Specifically, our kernel-based method, HANDL (Homology Assessment across Networks using Diffusion and Landmarks), integrates sequence and network structure to create a functional embedding in which proteins from different species are embedded in the same vector space. We show that inner products in this space capture functional similarity across species, and the vectors themselves are useful for a variety of cross species tasks. We perform the first whole-genome method for predicting phenologs, generating many that were previously identified, but also predicting new phenologs supported from the biological literature.

Initial computational approaches to transfer knowledge across species have relied on measures of heredity such as genetic homology, but these approaches suffer from limitations. First, only a small subset of genes have homologs, limiting the amount of knowledge that can be transferred, and second, genes change or repurpose functions, complicating the transfer of knowledge. Many approaches address this problem by expanding the notion of homology by leveraging high-throughput genomic and proteomic measurements, such as through network alignment. In this work, we take a new approach to transferring knowledge across species by expanding the notion of homology through explicit measures of functional similarity between proteins in different species. Specifically, our kernel-based method, HANDL (Homology Assessment across Networks using Diffusion and Landmarks), integrates sequence and network structure to create a functional embedding in which proteins from different species are embedded in the same vector space. We show that inner products in this space capture functional similarity across species, and the vectors themselves are useful for a variety of cross species tasks. We perform the first whole-genome method for predicting phenologs, generating many that were previously identified, but also predicting new phenologs supported from the biological literature. We also demonstrate the HANDL-embedding captures pairwise gene function, in that gene pairs with synthetic lethal interactions are co-located in HANDL-space both within and across species.

α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies found in synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Under the pathological conditions, α-syn tends to generate a diverse form of aggregates showing toxicity to neuronal cells and able to transmit across cells. However, mechanisms by which α-syn aggregates affect cytotoxicity in neurons have not been fully elucidated. Here we report that α-syn aggregates preferentially sequester specific synaptic proteins such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) through direct binding which is resistant to SDS. The sequestration effect of α-syn aggregates was shown in a cell-free system, cultured primary neurons, and PD mouse model. Furthermore, we identified a specific blocking peptide derived from VAMP2 which partially inhibited the sequestration by α-syn aggregates and contributed to reduced neurotoxicity. These results provide a mechanism of neurotoxicity mediated by α-syn aggregates and suggest that the blocking peptide interfering with the pathological role of α-syn aggregates could be useful for designing a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of PD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522702800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195339</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76935:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mal-Gi Choi, Mi Jin Kim, Do-Geun Kim, Ri Yu, You-Na Jang, Won-Jong Oh&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;HIV-1 dual infection is a condition that results from infection with at least two HIV-1 variants from different sources. The scarceness of information on this condition is partly due to the fact that its detection is technically challenging. Using next-generation sequencing we defined the extent of HIV-1 dual infection in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM).&lt;/p&gt; Material &amp;amp; methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-six MSM, diagnosed with HIV-1 subtype B infection between 2008 and 2013 were selected for next-generation sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;envelope&lt;/i&gt; V3. Sequencing was performed on 2 plasma samples collected with an interval of &gt; 6 months before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inspected for dual infection, defined as the presence of two or more monophyletic clusters with ≥ 90% bootstrap support and a mean between-cluster genetic distance of ≥ 10%. To confirm dual infection, deep V3 sequencing of intermediate samples was performed as well as clonal sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;protease-reverse transcriptase&lt;/i&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five of the 74 patients (6.8%) for whom deep sequencing was successful, showed clear evidence of dual infection. In 4 of them, the second strain was absent in the first sample but occurred in subsequent samples. This was highly suggestive for superinfection. In 3 patients both virus variants were of subtype B, in 2 patients at least one of the variants was a subtype B/non-B recombinant virus.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Dual infection was confirmed in 6.8% of MSM diagnosed with HIV-1 in Belgium. This prevalence is probably an underestimation, because stringent criteria were used to classify viral variants as originating from a new infection event.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523048400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195679</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd088:7c9981b6</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Hebberecht, Leen Vancoillie, Marlies Schauvliege, Delfien Staelens, Kenny Dauwe, Virginie Mortier, Chris Verhofstede&lt;/p&gt;

To confirm dual infection, deep V3 sequencing of intermediate samples was performed as well as clonal sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;protease-reverse transcriptase&lt;/i&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five of the 74 patients (6.8%) for whom deep sequencing was successful, showed clear evidence of dual infection. In 4 of them, the second strain was absent in the first sample but occurred in subsequent samples. This was highly suggestive for superinfection. In 3 patients both virus variants were of subtype B, in 2 patients at least one of the variants was a subtype B/non-B recombinant virus.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Dual infection was confirmed in 6.8% of MSM diagnosed with HIV-1 in Belgium. This prevalence is probably an underestimation, because stringent criteria were used to classify viral variants as originating from a new infection event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195679</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>94b32878</fingerprint><crawled>1523036346876</crawled></item><item><published>1523257200000</published><title>Genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for B-cell childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia</title><author><name>Jayaram Vijayakrishnan</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/IOcE2S3QTDw/s41467-018-03178-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for B-cell childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for B-cell childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03178-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03178-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;While GWAS have uncovered susceptibility loci for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), much of the heritable risk remains undiscovered.

The ability to simultaneously process and maintain multiple pieces of information is limited. Over the past 50 years, observational methods have provided a large amount of insight regarding the neural mechanisms that underpin the mental capacity that we refer to as “working memory.” More than 20 years ago, a neural coding scheme was proposed for working memory. As a result of technological developments, we can now not only observe but can also influence brain rhythms in humans. Building on these novel developments, we have begun to externally control brain oscillations in order to extend the limits of working memory.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZK-DqGkj6Do&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524171600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005867</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005867</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagementRate>0.44</engagementRate><recrawled>1524160804722</recrawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162df0f876e:4dc26a:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zsolt Turi, Ivan Alekseichuk, Walter Paulus&lt;/p&gt;

Agricultural crops play an important role in the global carbon and water cycle. Global climate change scenarios predict enhanced water scarcity and altered precipitation pattern in many parts of the world. Hence, a mechanistic understanding of water fluxes, productivity and water use efficiency of cultivated crops is of major importance, i.e. to adapt management practices. We compared water and carbon fluxes of paddy and rainfed rice by canopy scale gas exchange measurements, crop growth, daily evapotranspiration, transpiration and carbon flux modeling. Throughout a monsoon rice growing season, soil evaporation in paddy rice contributed strongly to evapotranspiration (96.6% to 43.3% from initial growth to fully developed canopy and amounted to 57.9% of total water losses over the growing seasons. Evaporation of rainfed rice was significantly lower (by 65% on average) particularly before canopy closure. Water use efficiency (WUE) was significantly higher in rainfed rice both from an agronomic (WUE&lt;sub&gt;agro&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. grain yield per evapotranspiration) and ecosystem (WUE&lt;sub&gt;eco&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. gross primary production per evapotranspiration) perspective. However, our results also show that higher WUE in rainfed rice comes at the expense of higher respiration losses compared to paddy rice (26% higher on average). Hence, suggestions on water management depend on the regional water availability (i.e. Mediterranean vs. Monsoon climate) and the balance between higher respiratory losses versus a potential reduction in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gas emissions. Our results suggest that a shift from rainfed/unsaturated soil to waterlogged paddy conditions after closure of the rice canopy might be a good compromise towards a sustainable use of water while preserving grain yield, particularly for water-limited production areas.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523048400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd070:7c9981b6</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bhone Nay‐Htoon, Wei Xue, Steve Lindner, Matthias Cuntz, Jonghan Ko, John Tenhunen, Christiane Werner, Maren Dubbert&lt;/p&gt;

This should surprise no one at all, but it’s good to have some quantitative data on the problem. There are limitations to the study – for one thing, it’s quite possible that (self-selected) respondents were among those more likely to have experienced these problems. The survey was done across 26 different countries (over 2200 respondents), 70% female/28% male/2% transgender, and the fields of study involved were 56% humanities and 38% physical sciences – no breakdown of the numbers by these categories is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these reservations, I have no trouble believing the overall conclusions – based on my own experience and my observations since, I think that anxiety and depression are &lt;em&gt;very close to inevitable&lt;/em&gt; in graduate study, and that students should be aware of what they’re getting into. What’s happening, in any field, is the rubber finally meeting the road: you’re not just sitting in classrooms; you’re doing what practitioners of your chosen line of work actually do, and you’re finding out what that’s really like and whether or not you’re any good at it. If that doesn’t bring on the occasional bout of anxiety and self-doubt, then something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from that to depression is not such a huge jump, either. All of us who have been through grad school have seen people who sort of freeze up at some point in their progress. Sometimes it happens near the beginning, such as when chemistry graduate students move out of classes and into the labs – some of them just can’t seem to get anything going. I remember people who were always just about to start something, just about to figure out what went wrong with the last thing (which was spread out into a bunch of inconclusive samples around their hoods), just about to really start making some progress. But they never did. Later in the process, another familiar figure is the person who’s been hanging around for years in the lab, running ever more experiments to avoid writing up, as is their near-relative, the person who’s actually out of the lab, writing up that dissertation/thesis, expected to set a defense date pretty soon. . .and who in the end, is never heard from again after a while, finding themselves unable to get the thing done. After a while, the official notices from the department come back stamped “Addressee unknown”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression might well be a good description of what’s going on in many of these situations. Someone finds themselves in an untenable situation and sinks into a state that makes it more untenable every day. David Foster Wallace defined a harmful addiction as something that offered itself as the remedy for the problems that it itself was causing (as with alcohol), and the downward-spiral mode of life has some similarities, as a big factor in what put you into this spot makes you ever less likely to do anything about it. The canonical view of major depression from the inside is William Styron’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2pFf7lZ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darkness Visible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but you don’t have to be as far along as Styron was to be in real trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I got quite as far as depression myself, but there’s no doubt that I was under significant stress. Even the stock of stories that I have from grad school illustrates that. So many of them feature me losing my temper about something, and honestly, I rarely do that out here in the real world. I well recall unnerving bouts of fear and uncertainty, wondering if I was doing the right thing with my life, wondering if it was too late to do much about that even if I were, wondering if my research was any good or if I was any good at doing it, and what I was going to do about it if the answer to either or both of those were actually “No”. And so on. By the end of it, I was thoroughly sick of my project, wildly ready to get out the door and see what the post-doc life was going to be like (and very much wondering if it would turn out to be more of the same, in a different location).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw some outright breakdowns while I was in grad school – there’s no other way to describe them. In some cases a person’s hours and behavior would become erratic, their actions hard to understand or predict. Sometimes in these the ship would apparently right itself and sometimes it wouldn’t. I saw examples of just those situations mentioned above, with people unable to make a real start in research or unable to write up at the end of it. And there was one flat-out suicide attempt, very nearly successful and permanently damaging to the person involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my own worst moments, I would be standing there in the lab feeling like a pitcher out on the mound who had just shaken off every pitch he knew how to throw. I was hauling material up the mountainside of a long linear synthesis, and I was frustrated to a degree beyond anything I’d ever experienced. I didn’t feel like working up the reactions in front of me, and I didn’t feel like setting up others. Waiting for me was my reward at the end of twenty-odd linear steps, the chance to risk all my hard work by trying (finally) some new chemistry that would probably not work and might well destroy my starting material in the process. Oh joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve told this next story before, but can’t track down the post where I did. At any rate, a pivotal moment was when I was bashing along with the largest load of starting material I’d ever made. Up at around step 9 (I was still in liter-sized flask territory) I was ready to work up the whole batch after a late-night reaction. I added some ammonium chloride and extracted the black mixture. That didn’t worry me; it was always black. I evaporated it down to a bunch of black oil and loaded it on a big gravity column of coarse silica gel – from prior runs, I knew that would hold the black crud at the top and allow a big yellow band of product to elute. Except this time the whole column turned black. Must have overloaded the column with this big pile of material, I thought. I collected a bunch of black fractions and rota-vapped them down, only to find what I sort of thought was a lot less oil than I’d been expecting. Reserving worry, I set up another column on that stuff, and this time the whole column turned black again, and nothing at all came out the other end but slightly discolored solvent. I had, in fact, destroyed my entire huge batch, because at 2 AM I was too groggy to remember that I was supposed to work it up with saturated bicarb, not ammonium chloride. All gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood there, alone, in the middle of the night, looking at all the mess I’d created. Ruined, all that batch of material that was going to finally get my synthesis finished and get me out of this place. I shook my head, cursed loudly, and went home, and to my surprise I fell asleep fairly quickly. What else was there to do? I woke up the next morning and went through that terrible disorienting feeling when after a few seconds you suddenly remember that something bad happened the night before. And then I got up and went to the lab, and set up an even larger batch back at the beginning of the synthesis, step one. Looking back, that night and that morning were a key episode in my graduate career and my life in general, because that batch I started that next day really did get me out in the end. I had bent and come very close to breaking at times, but it turned out that the worst had happened and I was still in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things definitely could have gone in other ways, though, and if they had there’s no telling where I would be now or what I would be doing. If that incident had happened to me a year before, I don’t know how I would have taken it. By the time I speak of, I had my eyes on the door and a PhD defense, having decided that the shortest way out of this awful situation was in that direction. I was devoting all my efforts to it, in an “OK, did today get me closer to defending, or not?” sort of way. Earlier, though, I was too far from the beginning and too far from the end to have that mindset, and a whopping failure would not have gone down well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important for graduate students to realize that &lt;em&gt;everyone has these doubts and bad stretches&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone has these moments when they wonder what they’ve done to their lives, but having these thoughts is &lt;em&gt;not a sign&lt;/em&gt; that the exact failure you’re fearing has arrived. That doesn’t mean that thinking about your purpose in grad school is a bad thing, but it probably is a bad thing to try to do it at periods of peak emotional stress. If you feel that it really is getting too much, definitely talk to someone. Universities have people around for just that purpose – more so than in my day, fortunately – and if you find yourself wondering if you should reach out like that, then odds are that you should. Do it. I wish some of the people I worked with had, or had been able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any meaningful graduate degree is going to be a test of your abilities and your resilience. Recognize this, and avoid the two extremes. On one end are the macho types whose response is “Eat stress for breakfast! That’s what I did in my day! If you don’t have the fire in your belly you don’t belong here!”. And on the other end are the voices, some perhaps external and some internal, telling you that you’re a failure already, an imposter, and that you’re never going to measure up anyway. These are two different sets of lies, and everyone has to steer their course between them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><summary><content>According to this new survey, depression and anxiety are far more common among graduate students than in the general population.

Our data suggested that transient synapses formed on early immature neurons regulate radial migration.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/313?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>195420b5</fingerprint><crawled>1524160533249</crawled></item><item><published>1522814371000</published><title>Effect of tacticity on the structure and glass transition temperature of polystyrene adsorbed onto solid surfaces</title><author><name>Solomon Negash</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010276?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010276?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b59:7c9981b6</id><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010276?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>58e44ffe</fingerprint><crawled>1523085743269</crawled></item><item><published>1522393200000</published><title>Author Correction: Attenuation of RNA polymerase II pausing mitigates BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation and tumorigenesis</title><author><name>Xiaowen Zhang</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/Dkp5KzPF-U4/ncomms16211</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Attenuation of RNA polymerase II pausing mitigates BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation and tumorigenesis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Attenuation of RNA polymerase II pausing mitigates BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation and tumorigenesis, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16211&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16211&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Attenuation of RNA polymerase II pausing mitigates BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation and tumorigenesis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/Dkp5KzPF-U4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16211</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16211</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162764edef1:7865ba4:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Attenuation of RNA polymerase II pausing mitigates BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation and tumorigenesis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Attenuation of RNA polymerase II pausing mitigates BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation and tumorigenesis, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16211&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16211&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Attenuation of RNA polymerase II pausing mitigates BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation and tumorigenesis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/Dkp5KzPF-U4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16211</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>25ef3017</fingerprint><crawled>1522403303153</crawled></item><item><published>1523257200000</published><title>A hypothalamic circuit for the circadian control of aggression</title><author><name>William D.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To explore the relation between cigarette smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness at first diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients diagnosed with urinary bladder cancer (BC) between 1995–2011 under the age of 75 years were retrospectively identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and invited for a study on genetic and lifestyle risk factors for BC. Information on patients’ self-reported smoking history was retrieved by means of a postal questionnaire. Tumors were stratified regarding the risk of progression defined by tumor stage and grade. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the relation between smoking intensity and aggressiveness of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The UBC study population comprised 323 (17.4%) never smokers, 870 (46.8%) former cigarette smokers, and 630 (33.9%) current cigarette smokers. A higher smoking amount was a risk factor of getting high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) compared with low-risk NMIBC in ever and former cigarette smokers (OR: 1.02 per cigarette smoked, 95% CI: 1.00–1.03 and OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.05, respectively). A statistically significant dose-response increase in the risk of a more aggressive cancer type (high-risk NMIBC and MIBC) was observed with increasing smoking duration among former smokers (p for trend 0.035 and 0.008, respectively). No significant association of the evaluated smoking intensity variables was observed in current smokers. A longer time of smoking cessation correlated with a lower odds of a more aggressive cancer.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;We observed a weak increase in the risk of a more aggressive tumor type with increasing smoking intensity in former smokers, but this association was absent in current smokers.This conflicting result may suggest that there is no strong relation between smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness. Analyses of prospective studies with longitudinal smoking assessment may provide a more definitive answer to the research question.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1521838800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194039</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51bf:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by André L.

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to administer a Delphi panel survey and provide evidence for the development of a psychological intervention protocol for use after disasters in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A three-round Delphi survey was conducted. In all rounds, respondents answered open- or closed-ended questions regarding their views on i) the concept of disaster, ii) evaluation, iii) intervention, and iv) considerations in a disaster. Data from Round 1 were subjected to content analysis. In Round 2, items with content validity ratios (CVRs) greater than 0.49 were included, and in Round 3, items with a CVR≥0.38 were accepted.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The response rates for the Delphi survey were high: 83% (n = 15, Round 1), 80% (n = 16, Round 2), and 86% (n = 24, Round 3). The data collected during this survey showed a need for a support system for children; for preventive strategies, including disaster readiness plans; for the protection of children&apos;s safety; and for the development of post-disaster psychosocial care.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The panel experts reached a consensus regarding the steps they considered critical in post-disaster evaluation and intervention.

The accuracy of this process is largely dependent on the availability of machine-readable resources associating synonyms and abbreviations commonly found in biomedical literature with uniform identifiers. Results: In a task involving automated reading of ~215,000 articles using the REACH event extraction software we found that grounding was disproportionately inaccurate for multi-protein families (e.g., &amp;quot;AKT&amp;quot;) and complexes with multiple subunits (e.g. &amp;quot;NF-kappaB&amp;quot;). To address this problem we constructed FamPlex, a manually curated resource defining protein families and complexes as they are commonly encountered in biomedical text. In FamPlex the gene-level constituents of families and complexes are defined in a flexible format allowing for multi-level, hierarchical membership. To create FamPlex, text strings corresponding to entities were identified empirically from literature and linked manually to uniform identifiers; these identifiers were also mapped to equivalent entries in multiple related databases. FamPlex also includes curated prefix and suffix patterns that improve named entity recognition and event extraction. Evaluation of REACH extractions on a test corpus of ~54,000 articles showed that FamPlex significantly increased grounding accuracy for families and complexes (from 15% to 71%). The hierarchical organization of entities in FamPlex also made it possible to integrate otherwise unconnected mechanistic information across families, subfamilies, and individual proteins. Applications of FamPlex to the TRIPS/DRUM reading system and the Biocreative VI Bioentity Normalization Task dataset demonstrated the utility of FamPlex in other settings. Conclusion: FamPlex is an effective resource for improving named entity recognition, grounding, and relationship resolution in automated reading of biomedical text.

We present a fast, robust and parsimonious approach to detecting signals in an ordered sequence of numbers. Our motivation is in seeking a suitable method to take a sequence of scores corresponding to properties of positions in virus genomes, and find outlying regions of low scores. Suitable statistical methods without using complex models or making many assumptions are surprisingly lacking. We resolve this by developing a method that detects regions of low score within sequences of real numbers. The method makes no assumptions &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; about the length of such a region; it gives the explicit location of the region and scores it statistically. It does not use detailed mechanistic models so the method is fast and will be useful in a wide range of applications. We present our approach in detail, and test it on simulated sequences. We show that it is robust to a wide range of signal morphologies, and that it is able to capture multiple signals in the same sequence. Finally we apply it to viral genomic data to identify regions of evolutionary conservation within influenza and rotavirus.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523653200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195763</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179362c:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julia R.

Although there are several methods developed to detect DMRs, most of them are focused on detecting relatively large differences in methylation levels and fail to detect moderate, but consistent, methylation changes that might be associated to complex disorders. Results: We present mCSEA, an R package that implements a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method to identify differentially methylated regions from Illumina 450K and EPIC array data. It is especially useful for detecting subtle, but consistent, methylation differences in complex phenotypes. mCSEA also implements functions to integrate gene expression data and to detect genes with significant correlations among methylation and gene expression patterns. Using simulated datasets, we show that mCSEA outperforms other tools in detecting DMRs. In addition, we applied mCSEA to a previously published dataset of sibling pairs discordant for intrauterine hyperglycemia exposure. We found several differentially methylated promoters in genes related to metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes, demonstrating the potential of mCSEA to identify differentially methylated regions not detected by other methods.

However, existing approaches require a large number of plasma samples from healthy individuals, sequenced using the same platform and protocols to act as a reference panel. Obtaining this reference panel can be challenging, prohibitively expensive and limits the ability to migrate to improved sequencing platforms and improved protocols. Methods: We developed qCNV and sCNA-seq, two distinct tools that together provide a new approach for profiling somatic copy number alterations (sCNA) through the analysis of cell free DNA (cfDNA) without a reference panel. Our approach was designed to identify sCNA from cfDNA through the analysis of a single plasma sample and a matched normal DNA sample - both of which can be obtained from the same blood draw. qCNV is an efficient method for extracting read-depth from BAM files and sCNA-seq is a method that uses a probabilistic model of read depth to infer the copy number segmentation of the tumour. We compared the results from our pipeline to the established copy number profile of a cell-line, as well as the results from the plasma-Seq analysis of cfDNA-like mixtures and real, clinical data-sets. Results: With a single, unmatched, germline reference sample, our pipeline recapitulated the known copy number profile of a cell-line and demonstrated similar results to those obtained from plasma-Seq. With less than 1X genome coverage, our approach identified clinically relevant sCNA in samples with as little as 20 % tumour DNA. When applied to plasma samples from cancer patients, our pipeline identified clinically significant mutations. Conclusions: These results show it is possible to identify therapeutically-relevant copy number mutations from plasma samples without the need to generate a reference panel from a large number of healthy individuals.

Neurons require a nearly constant supply of ATP. Glucose is the predominant source of brain ATP, but the direct effects of prolonged glucose deprivation on neuronal viability and function remain unclear. In sparse rat hippocampal microcultures, neurons were surprisingly resilient to 16 h glucose removal in the absence of secondary excitotoxicity. Neuronal survival and synaptic transmission were unaffected by prolonged removal of exogenous glucose. Inhibition of lactate transport decreased microculture neuronal survival during concurrent glucose deprivation, suggesting that endogenously released lactate is important for tolerance to glucose deprivation. Tandem depolarization and glucose deprivation also reduced neuronal survival, and trace glucose concentrations afforded neuroprotection. Mass cultures, in contrast to microcultures, were insensitive to depolarizing glucose deprivation, a difference attributable to increased extracellular lactate levels. Removal of local astrocyte support did not reduce survival in response to glucose deprivation or alter evoked excitatory transmission, suggesting that on-demand, local lactate shuttling is not necessary for neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose removal. Taken together, these data suggest that endogenously produced lactate available globally in the extracellular milieu sustains neurons in the absence of glucose. A better understanding of resilience mechanisms in reduced preparations could lead to therapeutic strategies aimed to bolster these mechanisms in vulnerable neuronal populations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522875600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195520</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ec8:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Courtney Sobieski, Natasha Warikoo, Hong-Jin Shu, Steven Mennerick&lt;/p&gt;

In our study we examined postural performance of young healthy persons (HY), elderly healthy persons (HE), and elderly persons at high risk of falling (FR). Anterio-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) ankle and hip angular deviations, as well as linear displacements of the center of mass (COM) were assessed in persons standing with eyes either open or closed, while none, and 40 and 30 Hz vibrations were applied bilaterally to the ankle muscle gastrocnemius. During quiet standing with eyes open, balance parameters in FR group differed from those in healthy groups. ML ankle and hip angular deviations, as well as COM linear displacements were noticeably larger in FR group. During quiet standing with eyes closed, all balance parameters in participants of all groups had a clear trend to increase. During standing with eyes open, 40 Hz vibration increased all but one balance parameter within HY group, ankle angular deviations in HE group, but none in FR group. In response to 30 Hz vibration, only ankle angular deviations and COM linear displacements increased in HY group. There were no changes in both elderly groups. During standing with eyes closed, 40 and 30 Hz vibrations did not produce consistent changes in balance parameters in HY and HE groups. In FR persons, 40 Hz vibration did not change balance parameters. However, in FR groups, 30 Hz vibration decreased ankle and hip angular deviations, and COM linear displacements. The major result of the study is a finding that low intensity vibration of ankle muscles makes balance better in elderly persons at high risk of falling. This result is clinically relevant because it suggests that applying mild vibration to ankle muscles while standing and walking might benefit elderly persons, improving their postural performance and reducing a risk of unexpected falls.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522098000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194720</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f5:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nima Toosizadeh, Jane Mohler, Vladimir Marlinski&lt;/p&gt;

In the present study, we examined the effects of different drying conditions on the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages. We approached this objective by comparing invertebrate assemblages in perennial and intermittent sites along two intermittent Mediterranean streams with contrasting predictability, duration, and spatial patterns of drying: Fuirosos (high predictability, short duration, downstream drying pattern) and Rogativa (low predictability, long duration, patchy drying pattern). Specifically, we quantified the contribution of individual taxa to those differences, the degree of nestedness, and shifts in the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages along flow intermittence gradients. We observed greater effects of drying on the benthic invertebrate composition in Fuirosos than in Rogativa, resulting in a higher dissimilarity of assemblages between perennial and intermittent sites, as well as a lower degree of nestedness. Furthermore, a higher number of biotic metrics related to richness, abundance and biological traits were significantly different between perennial and intermittent sites in Fuirosos, despite a shorter dry period compared to Rogativa. At the same time, slightly different responses were detected during post-drying (autumn) than pre-drying (spring) conditions in this stream.

In the present study, we examined the effects of different drying conditions on the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages. We approached this objective by comparing invertebrate assemblages in perennial and intermittent sites along two intermittent Mediterranean streams with contrasting predictability, duration, and spatial patterns of drying: Fuirosos (high predictability, short duration, downstream drying pattern) and Rogativa (low predictability, long duration, patchy drying pattern). Specifically, we quantified the contribution of individual taxa to those differences, the degree of nestedness, and shifts in the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages along flow intermittence gradients. We observed greater effects of drying on the benthic invertebrate composition in Fuirosos than in Rogativa, resulting in a higher dissimilarity of assemblages between perennial and intermittent sites, as well as a lower degree of nestedness. Furthermore, a higher number of biotic metrics related to richness, abundance and biological traits were significantly different between perennial and intermittent sites in Fuirosos, despite a shorter dry period compared to Rogativa. At the same time, slightly different responses were detected during post-drying (autumn) than pre-drying (spring) conditions in this stream. In Rogativa, shifts in benthic invertebrate assemblages along increasing gradients of flow intermittence were found for three metrics (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) and Odonata, Coleoptera and Heteroptera (OCH) abundances and aerial active dispersal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combined gradients of dry period duration and distance to nearest perennial reach can generate complex, and different, responses of benthic invertebrate assemblages, depending on the flow intermittence metric. Our study advances the notion that special attention should be paid to the predictability, duration and spatial patterns of drying in intermittent streams in order to disentangle the effects of drying on benthic invertebrate assemblages, in particular in areas subject to high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in drying conditions.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193933</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>2ad5a22a</fingerprint><crawled>1522259109027</crawled></item><item><published>1522345097000</published><title>Shifts in disease dynamics in a tropical amphibian assemblage are not due to pathogen attenuation</title><author><name>Voyles, J., Woodhams, D.

The precise sizing of the stent graft in thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) affects aortic remodeling and hence, further outcome. Covering the proximal entry tear is essential for successful treatment of Type B aortic dissection. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) enables real-time aortic diameter assessment, and is especially useful when computed tomography (CT) image quality is poor. IVUS, however, is not routinely utilized due to cost inefficiency. We investigated the impact of IVUS-assisted stent graft sizing on aortic remodeling in TEVAR. In this single-center retrospective study we evaluated patients with Type B aortic dissection undergoing both CT and IVUS before TEVAR. We assessed the aortic diameter at the level of the left subclavian artery via both methods before stent implantation and analyzed due to which method the implanted stent graft was chosen, retrospectively. To determine the degrees of aortic remodeling involved, we evaluated true lumen and false lumen diameters, and total aortic remodeling in CT. We analyzed 45 patients with Type B aortic dissection undergoing TEVAR. The mean ages were 66.9±10.0 years fo0072 IVUS (n = 20) and 62.3±14.2 years for CT-assisted TEVAR (n = 25; p = 0.226). The follow-up time for both groups did not differ between the two groups (IVUS: 22.9±23.1 months, CT: 25.6±23.0 months; p = 0.700). While both methods were associated with advantages regarding aortic remodeling, IVUS-assisted sizing yielded a greater increase in true lumen (30.4±6.2 vs. 25.6±5.3; p = 0.008) and reductions in false lumen (14.4±8.5 vs. 23.9±9.3; p = 0.001) and total aortic diameter (35.5±6.0 vs. 39.9±8.1; p = 0.045).

IVUS-guided stent graft sizing in Type B aortic dissection shows beneficial effects on aortic remodeling and might be of additional advantage in aortic diseases, especially when CT image quality is poor.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196180</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>e1e335e7</fingerprint><crawled>1524160641534</crawled></item><item><published>1522121050699</published><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24883?af=R</originId><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24883?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24883?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>False</unread><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162657c0a4b:6ce1a:76251cdd</id><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>dbd849ad</fingerprint><crawled>1522121050699</crawled></item><item><published>1522306800000</published><title>Neurons in the Pigeon Nidopallium Caudolaterale Display Value-Related Activity</title><author><name>Madeline Dykes</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>42</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/KLEk9kLelyA/s41598-018-23694-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neurons in the Pigeon Nidopallium Caudolaterale Display Value-Related Activity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the Pigeon Nidopallium Caudolaterale Display Value-Related Activity, Published online: 29 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23694-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23694-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Neurons in the Pigeon Nidopallium Caudolaterale Display Value-Related Activity&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/KLEk9kLelyA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23694-8</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23694-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23694-8/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23694_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><height>316</height></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162710fdea9:7193cb1:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neurons in the Pigeon Nidopallium Caudolaterale Display Value-Related Activity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the Pigeon Nidopallium Caudolaterale Display Value-Related Activity, Published online: 29 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23694-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23694-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Neurons in the Pigeon Nidopallium Caudolaterale Display Value-Related Activity&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/KLEk9kLelyA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23694-8</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>e1f17567</fingerprint><crawled>1522315288233</crawled></item><item><published>1522168915000</published><title>Deletion of dopamine D2 receptors from parvalbumin interneurons in mouse causes schizophrenia-like phenotypes [Neuroscience]</title><author><name>Eugenia Tomasella, Lucila Bechelli, Mora Belen Ogando, Camilo Mininni, Mariano N.

Background &lt;p&gt;Data on implications of a high positive titer of serum anti-&lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; antibody on gastric cancer (GC) is limited. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of GC with a high serum anti-&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; IgG (Hp-IgG) titer, and its association with diffuse-type GC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical and histological characteristics of 917 non-cardia GC patients who underwent gastrectomy. &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection was determined serologically by measuring Hp-IgG titer with immunoassay. Seropositive patients were divided into three groups (low-positive, mid-positive, and high-positive) according to the Hp-IgG titer value. Tumors were classified according to the Lauren criteria as diffuse or intestinal types.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median age of the patients was 59.0 years, and 33.8% were female. The patents were grouped as follows: seronegative, 188 (20.5%); low-positive, 288 (31.4%); mid-positive, 290 (31.6%); and high-positive 151 (16.5%). The high-positive group was significantly younger (median age, 55.0 years), with a higher proportion of female (45.0%) and non-smokers (58.9%). The proportion of diffuse-type GC increased in the order low-, mid-, and high-positive groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). In univariate analysis, the factors associated with diffuse-type GC were younger age, female sex, non-smokers, and a high-positive Hp-IgG titer. Younger age, female sex, and non-smokers remained significant on multivariate analysis whereas the high-positive Hp-IgG titer showed only a tendency toward the association (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.078).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Non-cardia GC patients with a high Hp-IgG titer have distinct clinicopathologic characteristics.

Animal models commonly serve as a bridge between &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments and clinical applications; however, few physiological processes in adult animals are sufficient to serve as proof-of-concept models for cartilage regeneration. Intriguingly, some rodents, such as young adult mice, undergo physiological connective tissue modifications to birth canal elements such as the pubic symphysis during pregnancy; therefore, we investigated whether the differential expression of cartilage differentiation markers is associated with cartilaginous tissue morphological modifications during these changes. Our results showed that osteochondral progenitor cells expressing &lt;i&gt;Runx2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sox9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Col2a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dcx&lt;/i&gt; at the non-pregnant pubic symphysis proliferated and differentiated throughout pregnancy, giving rise to a complex osteoligamentous junction that attached the interpubic ligament to the pubic bones until labour occurred. After delivery, the recovery of pubic symphysis cartilaginous tissues was improved by the time-dependent expression of these chondrocytic lineage markers at the osteoligamentous junction. This process potentially recapitulates embryologic chondrocytic differentiation to successfully recover hyaline cartilaginous pads at 10 days postpartum. Therefore, we propose that this physiological phenomenon represents a proof-of-concept model for investigating the mechanisms involved in cartilage restoration in adult animals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195304</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460a:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Gazieri Castelucci, Sílvio Roberto Consonni, Viviane Souza Rosa, Lucimara Aparecida Sensiate, Paula Cristina Rugno Delatti, Lúcia Elvira Alvares, Paulo Pinto Joazeiro&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;With the greatest burden of infant undernutrition and morbidity in low and middle income countries (LMICs), there is a need for suitable approaches to monitor infants in a simple, low-cost and effective manner. Anthropometry continues to play a major role in characterising growth and nutritional status.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a range of models to aid in identifying neonates at risk of malnutrition.

Background &lt;p&gt;With the greatest burden of infant undernutrition and morbidity in low and middle income countries (LMICs), there is a need for suitable approaches to monitor infants in a simple, low-cost and effective manner. Anthropometry continues to play a major role in characterising growth and nutritional status.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a range of models to aid in identifying neonates at risk of malnutrition. We first adopted a logistic regression approach to screen for a composite neonatal morbidity, low and high body fat (BF%) infants. We then developed linear regression models for the estimation of neonatal fat mass as an assessment of body composition and nutritional status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We fitted logistic regression models combining up to four anthropometric variables to predict composite morbidity and low and high BF% neonates.

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing breastfeeding rates have been associated with reductions in disease in babies and mothers as well as in related costs. ‘Nourishing Start for Health (NoSH)’, a financial incentive scheme has been proposed as a potentially effective way to increase both the number of mothers breastfeeding and duration of breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt; Aims &lt;p&gt;To establish women’s relative preferences for different aspects of a financial incentive scheme for breastfeeding and to identify importance of scheme characteristics on probability on participation in an incentive scheme.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A discrete choice experiment (DCE) obtained information on alternative specifications of the NoSH scheme designed to promote continued breastfeeding duration until at least 6 weeks after birth. Four attributes framed alternative scheme designs: value of the incentive; minimum breastfeeding duration required to receive incentive; method of verifying breastfeeding; type of incentive. Three versions of the DCE questionnaire, each containing 8 different choice sets, provided 24 choice sets for analysis. The questionnaire was mailed to 2,531 women in the South Yorkshire Cohort (SYC) aged 16–45 years in IMD quintiles 3–5. The analytic approach considered conditional and mixed effects logistic models to account for preference heterogeneity that may be associated with a variation in effects mediated by respondents’ characteristics.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;564 women completed the questionnaire and a response rate of 22% was achieved. Most of the included attributes were found to affect utility and therefore the probability to participate in the incentive scheme. Higher rewards were preferred, although the type of incentive significantly affected women’s preferences on average. We found evidence for preference heterogeneity based on individual characteristics that mediated preferences for an incentive scheme.ConclusionsAlthough participants’ opinion in our sample was mixed, financial incentives for breastfeeding may be an acceptable and effective instrument to change behaviour.

The origin of the machinery that realizes protein biosynthesis in all organisms is still unclear. One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states. The one unifying aspect of both classes is their function of binding ATP. We identified Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers as most compact ATP binding motifs characteristic for each Class. Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures. Regarding the origin of aaRS, the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis states that the peculiar nature of the two aaRS classes is the result of their primordial forms, called Protozymes, being encoded on opposite strands of the same gene. Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes. Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZqNwxiUByA0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006101</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006101</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1523911321731</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d3:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Kaiser, Sebastian Bittrich, Sebastian Salentin, Christoph Leberecht, V.

Background &lt;p&gt;While links between disability and poverty are well established, there have been few longitudinal studies to clarify direction of causality, particularly among older adults in low and middle income countries. We aimed to study the effect of care dependence among older adult residents on the economic functioning of their households, in catchment area survey sites in Peru, Mexico and China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Households were classified from the evolution of the needs for care of older residents, over two previous community surveys, as ‘incident care’, ‘chronic care’ or ‘no care’, and followed up three years later to ascertain economic outcomes (household income, consumption, economic strain, satisfaction with economic circumstances, healthcare expenditure and residents giving up work or education to care).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Household income did not differ between household groups. However, income from paid work (Pooled Count Ratio pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–1.00) and government transfers (pCR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69–0.93) were lower in care households. Consumption was 12% lower in chronic care households (pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99). Household healthcare expenditure was higher (pCR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26–1.90), and catastrophic healthcare spending more common (pRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.64–2.22) in care households.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While endogeneity cannot be confidently excluded as an explanation for the findings, this study indicates that older people’s needs for care have a discernable impact on household economics, controlling for baseline indicators of long-term economic status. Although living, typically, in multigenerational family units, older people have not featured prominently in global health and development agendas. Population ageing will rapidly increase the number of households where older people live, and their societal significance. Building sustainable long-term care systems for the future will require some combination of improved income security in old age; incentivisation of informal care through compensation for direct and opportunity costs; and development of community care services to support, and, where necessary, supplement or substitute the central role of informal caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523653200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793626:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maëlenn M.

Building sustainable long-term care systems for the future will require some combination of improved income security in old age; incentivisation of informal care through compensation for direct and opportunity costs; and development of community care services to support, and, where necessary, supplement or substitute the central role of informal caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195567</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>9d62ddb3</fingerprint><crawled>1523641501164</crawled></item><item><published>1522108800000</published><title>The kinetoplastid-infecting Bodo saltans virus (BsV), a window into the most abundant giant viruses in the sea</title><author><name>suttle@science.ubc.ca (Cheryl-Emiliane T Chow)</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33014</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33014</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Genomics and Evolutionary Biology</item><item>Microbiology and Infectious Disease</item></keywords><summary><content>Giant viruses are ecologically important players in aquatic ecosystems that have challenged concepts of what constitutes a virus.

Phylogenetic (or Evolutionary) Placement methods can be employed to determine the evolutionary position of sequences with respect to a given reference phylogeny. These placement methods do however face certain limitations: The manual selection of reference sequences is labor-intensive; the computational effort to infer reference phylogenies is substantially larger than for methods that rely on sequence similarity; the number of taxa in the reference phylogeny should be small enough to allow for visually inspecting the results. Results: We present algorithms to overcome the above limitations. First, we introduce a method to automatically construct representative sequences from databases to infer reference phylogenies.

Phylogenetic (or Evolutionary) Placement methods can be employed to determine the evolutionary position of sequences with respect to a given reference phylogeny. These placement methods do however face certain limitations: The manual selection of reference sequences is labor-intensive; the computational effort to infer reference phylogenies is substantially larger than for methods that rely on sequence similarity; the number of taxa in the reference phylogeny should be small enough to allow for visually inspecting the results. Results: We present algorithms to overcome the above limitations. First, we introduce a method to automatically construct representative sequences from databases to infer reference phylogenies. Second, we present an approach for conducting large-scale phylogenetic placements on nested phylogenies. Third, we describe a preprocessing pipeline that allows for handling huge sequence data sets. Our experiments on empirical data show that our methods substantially accelerate the workflow and yield highly accurate placement results.

The Florida manatee (&lt;i&gt;Trichechus manatus latirotris&lt;/i&gt;) is a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirus-induced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three G-tetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all TmPVs, G4 sequences were located in the non-coding region near putative E2 binding sites. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are possible regulatory elements in TmPVs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523307600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195625</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529e:9aea0a7d</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maryam Zahin, William L.

The e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) consist of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and chemical additives for flavoring. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, and while some have been tested for toxicity in the laboratory, most have not. Here, we developed a 3-phase, 384-well, plate-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to rapidly triage and validate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids. Our data demonstrated that the PG/VG vehicle adversely affected cell viability and that a large number of e-liquids were more toxic than PG/VG. We also performed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on all tested e-liquids. Subsequent nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that e-liquids are an extremely heterogeneous group. Furthermore, these data indicated that (i) the more chemicals contained in an e-liquid, the more toxic it was likely to be and (ii) the presence of vanillin was associated with higher toxicity values. Further analysis of common constituents by electron ionization revealed that the concentration of cinnamaldehyde and vanillin, but not triacetin, correlated with toxicity. We have also developed a publicly available searchable website (www.eliquidinfo.org). Given the large numbers of available e-liquids, this website will serve as a resource to facilitate dissemination of this information. Our data suggest that an HTS approach to evaluate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids is feasible. Such an approach may serve as a roadmap to enable bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to better regulate e-liquid composition.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Djo1Z76O3OU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522184400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003904</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003904</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1522172523352</recrawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162688d21d0:4b9326:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by M.

Tubulin isotypes are known to regulate the stability and dynamics of microtubules, and are also involved in the development of resistance against microtubule-targeted cancer drugs. Indanocine, a potent microtubule depolymerizing agent, is highly active against multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells without affecting normal cells. It is known to disrupt microtubule dynamics in cells and induce apoptotic cell death. Indanocine is reported to bind to tubulin at the colchicine site i.e. at the interface of αβ tubulin heterodimer. However, it’s precise binding mode, involved molecular interactions and the binding affinities with different αβ-tubulin isotypes present in MDR cells are not well understood. Here, the binding affinities of human αβ-tubulin isotypes with indanocine were examined, employing the molecular modeling approach i.e. docking, molecular dynamics simulation and binding energy calculations. Multiple sequence analysis suggests that the amino acid sequences are different in the indanocine binding pockets of βI, βIIa, βIII and βVI isotypes. However, such differences are not observed in the amino acid sequences of βIVa, βIVb, and βV tubulin isotypes at indanocine binding pockets. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation results show that indanocine prefers the interface binding pocket of αβIIa, αβIII, αβIVb, αβV, and αβVI tubulin isotypes; whereas it is expelled from the interface binding pocket of αβIVa and αβI-tubulin isotypes. Further, binding free energy calculations show that αβVI has the highest binding affinity and αβI has the lowest binding affinity for indanocine among all β-tubulin isotypes. The binding free energy decreases in the order of αβVI &gt; αβIVb &gt; αβIIa &gt; αβIII &gt; αβV &gt; αβIVa &gt; αβI. Thus, our study provides a significant understanding of involved molecular interactions of indanocine with tubulin isotypes, which may help to design potent indanocine analogues for specific tubulin isotypes in MDR cells in future.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522184400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194934</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1a:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bajarang Vasant Kumbhar, Dulal Panda, Ambarish Kunwar&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Diagnosing HIV and/or TB is not sufficient; linkage to care and treatment is conditional to reduce the burden of disease. This study aimed to determine factors associated with linkage to HIV care and TB treatment at community-based services in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized routinely collected data from clients who utilized stand-alone (fixed site not attached to a health facility) and mobile HIV testing services in eight communities in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan district, between January 2008 and June 2012. Clients were included in the analysis if they were ≥12 years and had a known HIV status. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were used to assess the association between determinants (sex, age, HIV testing service and co-infection status) and self-reported linkage to HIV care and/or TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Linkage to HIV care was 3 738/5 929 (63.1%). Linkage to HIV care was associated with the type of HIV testing service. Clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services had a significantly reduced odds of linking to HIV care (aOR 0.7 (CI 95%: 0.6–0.8), p&amp;lt;0.001. Linkage to TB treatment was 210/275 (76.4%). Linkage to TB treatment was not associated with sex and service type, but was associated with age. Clients in older age groups were less likely to link to TB treatment compared to clients in the age group 12–24 years (all, p-value&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A large proportion of clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services did not link to care.

Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive nucleotide sequences that make up a large portion of eukaryotic genomes. They can move and duplicate within a genome, increasing genome size and contributing to genetic diversity within and across species. Accurate identification and classification of TEs present in a genome is an important step towards understanding their effects on genes and their role in genome evolution. We introduce TE-Learner, a framework based on machine learning that automatically identifies TEs in a given genome and assigns a classification to them. We present an implementation of our framework towards LTR retrotransposons, a particular type of TEs characterized by having long terminal repeats (LTRs) at their boundaries. We evaluate the predictive performance of our framework on the well-annotated genomes of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and we compare our results for three LTR retrotransposon superfamilies with the results of three widely used methods for TE identification or classification: RepeatMasker, Censor and LtrDigest. In contrast to these methods, TE-Learner is the first to incorporate machine learning techniques, outperforming these methods in terms of predictive performance, while able to learn models and make predictions efficiently. Moreover, we show that our method was able to identify TEs that none of the above method could find, and we investigated TE-Learner’s predictions which did not correspond to an official annotation. It turns out that many of these predictions are in fact strongly homologous to a known TE.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WmOp0oT-h9c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006097</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006097</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1524516127247</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162f3a6e287:392b8:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leander Schietgat, Celine Vens, Ricardo Cerri, Carlos N.

It turns out that many of these predictions are in fact strongly homologous to a known TE.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WmOp0oT-h9c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006097</originId><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>fa317272</fingerprint><crawled>1524506223239</crawled></item><item><published>1523566800000</published><title>Design and preclinical characterization of ALXN1210: A novel anti-C5 antibody with extended duration of action</title><author><name>Douglas Sheridan</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Douglas Sheridan, Zhao-Xue Yu, Yuchun Zhang, Rekha Patel, Fang Sun, Melissa A.

Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against complement protein C5, is considered to be the current standard of care for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. This study describes the generation and preclinical attributes of ALXN1210, a new long-acting anti-C5 mAb, obtained through select modifications to eculizumab to both largely abolish target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) and increase recycling efficiency via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). To attenuate the effect of TMDD on plasma terminal half-life (t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;), histidine substitutions were engineered into the complementarity-determining regions of eculizumab to enhance the dissociation rate of the mAb:C5 complex in the acidic early endosome relative to the slightly basic pH of blood. Antibody variants with optimal pH-dependent binding to C5 exhibited little to no TMDD in mice in the presence of human C5. To further enhance the efficiency of FcRn-mediated recycling of the antibody, two additional substitutions were introduced to increase affinity for human FcRn. These substitutions yielded an additional doubling of the t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; of surrogate anti-mouse C5 antibodies with reduced TMDD in transgenic mice expressing the human FcRn. In conclusion, ALXN1210 is a promising new therapeutic candidate currently in clinical development for treatment of patients with PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66da:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Douglas Sheridan, Zhao-Xue Yu, Yuchun Zhang, Rekha Patel, Fang Sun, Melissa A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Initiated in 2016, &lt;i&gt;End Hep C SF&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive initiative to eliminate hepatitis C (HCV) infection in San Francisco. The introduction of direct-acting antivirals to treat and cure HCV provides an opportunity for elimination. To properly measure progress, an estimate of baseline HCV prevalence, and of the number of people in various subpopulations with active HCV infection, is required to target and measure the impact of interventions.

We examined subpopulations based on sex, age and/or HCV risk group.

Of these, 16,408 are estimated to be viremic (CR: 6,505–37,407), though this estimate includes treated cases; up to 12,257 of these (CR: 2,354–33,256) are people who are untreated and infectious.

Background &lt;p&gt;Initiated in 2016, &lt;i&gt;End Hep C SF&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive initiative to eliminate hepatitis C (HCV) infection in San Francisco.

The purpose of this study was to compare cardiovascular and respiratory effects of two volumes of bupivacaine 0.25% (0.2 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—treatment BUP02—and 0.4 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; –treatment BUP04) administered epidurally at the lumbosacral intervertebral space in dogs anesthetized with isoflurane. This experimental prospective randomized crossover design trial used six mixed breed adult dogs, four neutered males and two spayed females. Each dog was anesthetized on three different occasions: the first for isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) measurement, and the following two assigned treatments (BUP02 or BUP04). On the two treatment days, anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane at 1.3 MAC during the experiments. Cardiovascular and respiratory measurements were recorded before (T0) and 5, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after the epidural administration of bupivacaine. Comparisons between and within groups were performed by a mixed-model ANOVA and Friedman’s test when appropriate followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test or Dunnet’s test to compare time points within each treatment with T0 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly from 15 to 90 minutes after the administration of BUP02 and from 5 to 60 minutes in BUP04, with lower values in BUP04 than in BUP02 lasting up to 30 minutes after bupivacaine administration. No significant changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance were observed in either treatment. Hypoventilation was only detected in BUP04. Hemoglobin concentration and arterial oxygen content decreased after both treatment of bupivacaine with no significant decrease in oxygen delivery. Two dogs in BUP04 developed Horner’s syndrome. The epidural administration of 0.4 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of bupivacaine to dogs in sternal recumbency anesthetized with isoflurane 1.3 MAC caused more cardiovascular and respiratory depression than 0.2 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195867</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe32:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Raquel Sartori Gonçalves Dias, João Henrique Neves Soares, Douglas dos Santos e Castro, Maria Alice Kuster de Albuquerque Gress, Marcela Lemos Machado, Pablo E.

The centrosome is a non–membrane-bound cellular compartment consisting of 2 centrioles surrounded by a protein coat termed the pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrioles generally remain physically associated together (a phenomenon called centrosome cohesion), yet how this occurs in the absence of a bounding lipid membrane is unclear. One model posits that pericentriolar fibres formed from rootletin protein directly link centrioles, yet little is known about the structure, biophysical properties, or assembly kinetics of such fibres. Here, I combine live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged rootletin with cell fusion and find previously unrecognised plasticity in centrosome cohesion. Rootletin forms large, diffusionally stable bifurcating fibres, which amass slowly on mature centrioles over many hours from anaphase. Nascent centrioles (procentrioles), in contrast, do not form roots and must be licensed to do so through polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) activity. Transient separation of roots accompanies centriolar repositioning during the interphase, suggesting that centrioles organize as independent units, each containing discrete roots. Indeed, forced induction of duplicate centriole pairs allows independent reshuffling of individual centrioles between the pairs. Therefore collectively, these findings suggest that progressively nucleated polymers mediate the dynamic association of centrioles as either 1 or 2 interphase centrosomes, with implications for the understanding of how non–membrane-bound organelles self-organise.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/44jiWSXqczI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003998</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003998</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1523555760964</recrawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162bafef6cd:c0b2af:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Mahen&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore collectively, these findings suggest that progressively nucleated polymers mediate the dynamic association of centrioles as either 1 or 2 interphase centrosomes, with implications for the understanding of how non–membrane-bound organelles self-organise.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/44jiWSXqczI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003998</originId><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>6886410e</fingerprint><crawled>1523555694285</crawled></item><item><published>1524085200000</published><title>Prognostic value of C-reactive protein levels in patients with bone neoplasms: A meta-analysis</title><author><name>Wenyi Li</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195769</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195769</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wenyi Li, Xujun Luo, Zhongyue Liu, Yanqiao Chen, Zhihong Li&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of retrospective studies that investigated the association of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with the overall survival (OS) of patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A detailed literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and PubMed databases up to August 28, 2017, for related research publications written in English. We extracted the data from these studies and combined the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the correlation between CRP levels and OS in patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five studies with a total of 816 participants from several countries were enrolled in this current meta-analysis. In a pooled analysis of all the publications, increased serum CRP levels had an adverse prognostic effect on the overall survival of patients with bone neoplasms. However, the combined data showed no significant relationship between the level of CRP and OS in Asian patients (HR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.86–3.49; P = 0.125). Similar trends were observed in patients with bone neoplasms when stratified by ethnicity, histology, metastasis and study sample size.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The results of this meta-analysis suggest that increased CRP expression indicates a poorer prognosis in patients with bone neoplasms.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the number of studies that have tried to demonstrate that there is an association between previous falls and the fear of falling, the relationship between these two variables remains a matter of controversy.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our objective was to investigate whether the fear of falling is a cause of falls, a consequence, or both in community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 75 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A descriptive, longitudinal, prospective study was performed. A total of 640 individuals were interviewed between 2009 and 2011. Sociodemographic data, health status, history of falls and fear of falling were assessed at baseline and at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of falls at baseline was 25% as opposed to 35.2% at 24 months. The prevalence of the fear of falling was 41.5% at baseline. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between a history of falls and the fear of falling. Other factors associated with the fear of falling were female gender, comorbidity, depressive symptoms, and disability. In total, 41.7% of the subjects who had reported a fear of falling at baseline had suffered at least one fall 24 months later. Unadjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that the fear of falling was a risk factor for falls. According to the final model adjusted for other covariates, the only reliable predictor was female gender. The Cox model stratified by gender failed to show a crude association between fear of falling and falls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A previous history of falls in the previous year was a good predictor of the fear of falling; but the fear of falling was a predictor of falls during follow-up only in the unadjusted model, pointing to strong gender turns out as an effect modifier of the association of FOF and subsequent falls. Nursing staff working in elderly care should not only routinely assess patients’ previous history of falls, but also evaluate their fear of falling and its associated factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194967</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef12:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Lavedán, Maria Viladrosa, Pilar Jürschik, Teresa Botigué, Carmen Nuín, Olga Masot, Raquel Lavedán&lt;/p&gt;

Unadjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that the fear of falling was a risk factor for falls. According to the final model adjusted for other covariates, the only reliable predictor was female gender. The Cox model stratified by gender failed to show a crude association between fear of falling and falls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A previous history of falls in the previous year was a good predictor of the fear of falling; but the fear of falling was a predictor of falls during follow-up only in the unadjusted model, pointing to strong gender turns out as an effect modifier of the association of FOF and subsequent falls. Nursing staff working in elderly care should not only routinely assess patients’ previous history of falls, but also evaluate their fear of falling and its associated factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194967</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>1c21446</fingerprint><crawled>1522345504828</crawled></item><item><published>1523912400000</published><title>Estimating nearshore coral reef-associated fisheries production from the main Hawaiian Islands</title><author><name>Kaylyn S.

Currently, information on nearshore reef-associated fisheries is frequently disparate or incomplete, creating a challenge for effective management. This study utilized an existing non-commercial fishery dataset from Hawaiʻi, covering the period 2004–13, to estimate a variety of fundamental fishery parameters, including participation, effort, gear use, and catch per unit effort. We then used those data to reconstruct total catches per island. Non-commercial fisheries in this case comprise recreational, subsistence, and cultural harvest, which may be exchanged, but are not sold. By combining those data with reported commercial catch data, we estimated annual catch of nearshore reef-associated fisheries in the main Hawaiian Islands over the study period to be 1,167,758 ± 43,059 kg year&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (mean ± standard error). Average annual commercial reef fish catch over the same time period—184,911 kg year&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—was 16% of the total catch, but that proportion varied greatly among islands, ranging from 23% on Oʻahu to 5% on Molokaʻi. These results emphasize the importance of reef fishing in Hawaiʻi for reasons beyond commerce, such as food security and cultural practice, and highlight the large differences in fishing practices across the Hawaiian Islands.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195840</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae5:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kaylyn S.

However, the functional variants underlying these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context. Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells. To this end, we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data. Overall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohn&apos;s disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (p_rs102275=1.44e-20, p_rs968567=2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs (all with p&amp;lt;0.05). In summary, our study points towards a pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmunity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286260v2?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16291cb2608:9ee96b1:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic risk loci for autoimmune diseases.

Anti-drug antibody formation occurs with most biological agents across disease states, but the mechanism by which they are formed is unknown. The formation of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab (AAA) may decrease its therapeutic effects in some patients. HLA alleles have been reported to be associated with autoantibody formation against interferons and other TNF inhibitors, but not adalimumab. We analyzed samples from 634 subjects with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or hidradenitis suppurativa (HS): 37 subjects (17 RA and 20 HS) developed AAA (AAA+) during adalimumab treatment and 597 subjects (348 RA, 249 HS) did not develop AAA (AAA-) during the clinical trials. Using next-generation sequencing-based HLA typing, we identified three protective HLA alleles (HLA-DQB1*05, HLA-DRB1*01,and HLA-DRB1*07) that were less prevalent in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 0.4, 0.25 and 0.28, respectively; and P values: 0.012, 0.012 and 0.018, respectively) and two risk HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*011) that were more abundant in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 2.52, and 2.64, respectively; and P values: 0.006 and 0.019). Similar to the finding of Billiet &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. who found that carriage of the HLA-DRB1*03 allele was more prevalent in those with anti-infliximab antibodies (OR = 3.6, p = 0.002, 95% CI: [1.5,8.6]).), we found HLA-DRB1*03 allele was also more prevalent in anti-adalimumab positive (OR = 2.52, p = 0.006, 95% CI: [1.37,4.63]). The results suggest that specific HLA alleles may play a key role in developing AAAs in RA and HS patients treated with adalimumab.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522789200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195325</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f66:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohan Liu, Jacob Degner, Justin Wade Davis, Kenneth B.

The results suggest that specific HLA alleles may play a key role in developing AAAs in RA and HS patients treated with adalimumab.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195325</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>e08b35e8</fingerprint><crawled>1522777331269</crawled></item><item><published>1524085200000</published><title>Correction: Stroke survivors&apos; and informal caregivers&apos; experiences of primary care and community healthcare services - A systematic review and meta-ethnography</title><author><name>Dominika M.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The root cause behind the low-grade inflammatory state seen in insulin resistant (obesity and type 2 diabetes) states is unclear. Insulin resistant subjects have elevations in plasma free fatty acids (FFA), which are ligands for the pro-inflammatory toll-like receptor (TLR)4 pathway. We tested the hypothesis that an experimental elevation in plasma FFA (within physiological levels) in lean individuals would upregulate TLR4 and activate downstream pathways (e.g., MAPK) in circulating monocytes.&lt;/p&gt; Research design and methods &lt;p&gt;Twelve lean, normal glucose-tolerant subjects received a low dose (30 ml/h) 48 h lipid or saline infusion on two different occasions. Monocyte TLR4 protein level, MAPK phosphorylation, and expression of genes in the TLR pathway were determined before and after each infusion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The lipid infusion significantly increased monocyte TLR4 protein and phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK. Lipid-mediated increases in TLR4 and p38 phosphorylation directly correlated with reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity (M value). Lipid increased levels of multiple genes linked to inflammation, including several TLRs, CD180, MAP3K7, and CXCL10. Monocytes exposed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; to lipid infusion exhibited enhanced &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; basal and LPS-stimulated IL-1β secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In lean subjects, a small increase in plasma FFA (as seen in insulin resistant subjects) is sufficient to upregulate TLR4 and stimulate inflammatory pathways (MAPK) in monocytes. Moreover, lipids prime monocytes to endotoxin. We provide proof-of-concept data in humans indicating that the low-grade inflammatory state characteristic of obesity and type 2 diabetes could be caused (at least partially) by pro-inflammatory monocytes activated by excess lipids present in these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195810</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66cd:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanyu Liang, Helen Lum, Andrea Alvarez, Jose de Jesus Garduno-Garcia, Benjamin J.

Human protection policies require favorable risk–benefit judgments prior to launch of clinical trials. For phase I and II trials, evidence for such judgment often stems from preclinical efficacy studies (PCESs). We undertook a systematic investigation of application materials (investigator brochures [IBs]) presented for ethics review for phase I and II trials to assess the content and properties of PCESs contained in them. Using a sample of 109 IBs most recently approved at 3 institutional review boards based at German Medical Faculties between the years 2010–2016, we identified 708 unique PCESs. We then rated all identified PCESs for their reporting on study elements that help to address validity threats, whether they referenced published reports, and the direction of their results. Altogether, the 109 IBs reported on 708 PCESs. Less than 5% of all PCESs described elements essential for reducing validity threats such as randomization, sample size calculation, and blinded outcome assessment. For most PCESs (89%), no reference to a published report was provided. Only 6% of all PCESs reported an outcome demonstrating no effect. For the majority of IBs (82%), all PCESs were described as reporting positive findings. Our results show that most IBs for phase I/II studies did not allow evaluators to systematically appraise the strength of the supporting preclinical findings. The very rare reporting of PCESs that demonstrated no effect raises concerns about potential design or reporting biases. Poor PCES design and reporting thwart risk–benefit evaluation during ethical review of phase I/II studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Lvi8iDwsCE0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004879</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004879</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1522951034312</recrawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e7:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Wieschowski, William Wei Lim Chin, Carole Federico, Sören Sievers, Jonathan Kimmelman, Daniel Strech&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Multiple drug resistant (MDR) intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are associated with notable direct and societal costs. As previous studies have not considered the impact of MDR on the total medical costs (TMCs) of IAIs, the present one examines this, as well as further estimates the additional costs at a national level.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective study. Firstly, we randomly selected a sample of 40% of all inpatients discharged between 2014 and 2015 from a teaching hospital, due to limits in budget and the large number of patients. Then, we manually selected 254 patients with IAIs according to the International Classification of Disease, 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; revision, using electronic medical records. Eventually, 101 patients with IAIs (64 MDR patients and 37 non-MDR patients) were included after excluding cases without laboratory test results, any pathogens detected, or antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Univariate analysis and a generalized linear model were applied to assess the parameters associated with TMCs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to non-MDR patients, those with MDR pathogens were significantly associated with higher TMCs, higher antimicrobial costs, higher antimicrobial usage, larger number of pathogens, and longer length of stay and were more likely to have insurance and combination antimicrobial therapy. In addition, the average TMC among patients with MDR pathogens was ¥ 131801, which is ¥ 90201 higher than those without MDR pathogens. If our results are applied to the whole country, the sum of all attributable TMCs was ¥ 37 billion.

As previous studies have not considered the impact of MDR on the total medical costs (TMCs) of IAIs, the present one examines this, as well as further estimates the additional costs at a national level.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective study. Firstly, we randomly selected a sample of 40% of all inpatients discharged between 2014 and 2015 from a teaching hospital, due to limits in budget and the large number of patients. Then, we manually selected 254 patients with IAIs according to the International Classification of Disease, 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; revision, using electronic medical records. Eventually, 101 patients with IAIs (64 MDR patients and 37 non-MDR patients) were included after excluding cases without laboratory test results, any pathogens detected, or antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Univariate analysis and a generalized linear model were applied to assess the parameters associated with TMCs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to non-MDR patients, those with MDR pathogens were significantly associated with higher TMCs, higher antimicrobial costs, higher antimicrobial usage, larger number of pathogens, and longer length of stay and were more likely to have insurance and combination antimicrobial therapy. In addition, the average TMC among patients with MDR pathogens was ¥ 131801, which is ¥ 90201 higher than those without MDR pathogens. If our results are applied to the whole country, the sum of all attributable TMCs was ¥ 37 billion. The societal costs, furthermore, were ¥111 billion in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results provide information that should lead to increased efforts to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, in order to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens and to reduce their economic burden.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193977</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>35d306d4</fingerprint><crawled>1522259109027</crawled></item><item><published>1522098000000</published><title>Delay models for the early embryonic cell cycle oscillator</title><author><name>Jan Rombouts</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194769</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194769</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>False</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jan Rombouts, Alexandra Vandervelde, Lendert Gelens&lt;/p&gt;
Time delays are known to play a crucial role in generating biological oscillations. The early embryonic cell cycle in the frog &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; is one such example. Although various mathematical models of this oscillating system exist, it is not clear how to best model the required time delay. Here, we study a simple cell cycle model that produces oscillations due to the presence of an ultrasensitive, time-delayed negative feedback loop. We implement the time delay in three qualitatively different ways, using a fixed time delay, a distribution of time delays, and a delay that is state-dependent. We analyze the dynamics in all cases, and we use experimental observations to interpret our results and put constraints on unknown parameters. In doing so, we find that different implementations of the time delay can have a large impact on the resulting oscillations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522098000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194769</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f7:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jan Rombouts, Alexandra Vandervelde, Lendert Gelens&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the photochemical degradation of trypan blue (TB) and to identify decomposition products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Defined solution samples of TB and a mixture with lutein/zeaxanthin were exposed to blue light. Thermal degradation processes were ruled out using controls not subjected to irradiation. All samples were analyzed using optical microscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Degradation kinetics were determined based on changes in absorbance; intermediates were identified by analyzing mass differences of characteristic fragment ion peaks within the fragmentation patterns, and assignments were verified by NMR.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photochemical degradation, which can be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin. Intermediates vary depending on the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin. The self-sensitized photodegradation of TB occurs under generation of dimethyl sulfate and presumed formation of phenol. In contrast, within the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin the decomposition of TB indicates the formation of methoxyamine and sulfonyl arin. Thermal degradation processes were not observed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photodegradation that may be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin and results in the formation of cytotoxic decomposition products.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. An important step in the shift to a pro-cancerous microenvironment is the transformation of normal stromal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are present in a majority of solid tumors and can directly promote tumor cell motility via cytokine, chemokine and growth factor secretion into the TME. The exact effects that the TME has upon cytoskeletal regulation in motile tumor cells remain enigmatic. The conserved formin family of cytoskeleton regulating proteins plays an essential role in the assembly and/or bundling of unbranched actin filaments. Mammalian Diaphanous-related formin 2 (mDia2/DIAPH3/Drf3/Dia) assembles a dynamic F-actin cytoskeleton that underlies tumor cell migration and invasion. We therefore sought to understand whether CAF-derived chemokines impact breast tumor cell motility through modification of the formin-assembled F-actin cytoskeleton. In MDA-MB-231 cells, conditioned media (CM) from WS19T CAFs, a human breast tumor-adjacent CAF line, significantly and robustly increased wound closure and invasion relative to normal human mammary fibroblast (HMF)-CM. WS19T-CM also promoted proteasome-mediated mDia2 degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells relative to control HMF-CM and WS21T CAF-CM, a breast CAF cell line that failed to promote robust MDA-MB-231 migration. Cytokine array analysis of CM identified up-regulated secreted factors in WS19T relative to control WS21T CM. We identified CXCL12 as a CM factor influencing loss of mDia2 protein while increasing MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Our data suggest a mechanism whereby CAFs promote tumor cell migration and invasion through CXCL12 secretion to regulate the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton in breast tumor cells.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195278</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde33:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kaitlyn M.

Thorough understanding of biodiversity is a fundamental prerequisite for biological research. A lack of taxonomic knowledge and species misidentifications are particularly critical for conservation. Here we present an example of &lt;i&gt;Potamogeton floridanus&lt;/i&gt;, the Florida Pondweed, an endangered taxon endemic to a small area in the Florida panhandle, whose taxonomic status remained controversial for more than a century, and all previous attempts to elucidate its identity have failed. We applied molecular approaches to tackle the origin of the mysterious taxon and supplemented them with morphological and anatomical investigations of both historical herbarium collections and plants recently collected in the type area for a comprehensive taxonomic reassessment. Sequencing of two nuclear ribosomal markers and one chloroplast non-coding spacer resulted in the surprising discovery that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;floridanus&lt;/i&gt; is a hybrid of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pulcher&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;, with the former being the maternal parent. The hybrid colony is currently geographically isolated from the distribution range of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;. We show that previous molecular analyses have failed to reveal its hybrid identity due to inadequate nuclear DNA sequence editing. This is an example how the uncritical use of automized sequence reads can hamper molecular species identifications and also affect phylogenetic tree construction and interpretation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Unstable conditions of the craniocervical junction such as atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) or atlanto-axial instability (AAI) are severe injuries with a high risk of tetraplegia or death. Immobilization by a cervical collar to protect the patient from secondary damage is a standard procedure in trauma patients. If the application of a cervical collar to a patient with an unstable craniocervical condition may cause segmental motion and secondary injury to the spinal cord is unknown.The aim of the current study is (i) to analyze compression on the dural sac and (ii) to determine relative motion of the cervical spine during the procedure of applying a cervical collar in case of ligamentous unstable craniocervical junction.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Ligamentous AOD as well as AOD combined with ligamentous AAI was simulated in two newly developed cadaveric trauma models. Compression of the dural sac and segmental angulation in the upper cervical spine were measured on video fluoroscopy after myelography during the application of a cervical collar. Furthermore, overall three-dimensional motion of the cervical spine was measured by a motion tracking system.In six cadavers each, the two new trauma models on AOD and AOD combined with AAI could be implemented. Mean dural sac compression was significantly increased to -1.1 mm (-1.3 to -0.7 mm) in case of AOD and -1.2 mm (-1.6 to -0.6 mm) in the combined model of AOD and AAI. Furthermore, there is a significant increased angulation at the C0/C1 level in the AOD model. Immense three-dimensional movement up to 22.9° of cervical spine flexion was documented during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The current study pointed out that applying a cervical collar in general will cause immense three-dimensional movement.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Apigenin can exert beneficial actions in the prevention of obesity. However, its putative action on obesity-associated bowel motor dysfunctions is unknown. This study examined the effects of apigenin on colonic inflammatory and motor abnormalities in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt; Experimental approach &lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). SD or HFD mice were treated with apigenin (10 mg/Kg/day). After 8 weeks, body and epididymal fat weight, as well as cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels were evaluated. Malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1β and IL-6 levels, and &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression were also examined. Colonic infiltration by eosinophils, as well as substance P (SP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions were evaluated. Motor responses elicited under blockade of NOS and tachykininergic contractions were recorded &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; from colonic longitudinal muscle preparations.&lt;/p&gt; Key results &lt;p&gt;When compared to SD mice, HFD animals displayed increased body weight, epididymal fat weight and metabolic indexes. HFD mice showed increments in colonic MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 levels, as well as a decrease in &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in both colonic and epididymal tissues. HFD mice displayed an increase in colonic eosinophil infiltration. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in SP and iNOS expression in myenteric ganglia of HFD mice. In preparations from HFD mice, electrically evoked contractions upon NOS blockade or mediated by tachykininergic stimulation were enhanced.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Apigenin can exert beneficial actions in the prevention of obesity. However, its putative action on obesity-associated bowel motor dysfunctions is unknown. This study examined the effects of apigenin on colonic inflammatory and motor abnormalities in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt; Experimental approach &lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). SD or HFD mice were treated with apigenin (10 mg/Kg/day). After 8 weeks, body and epididymal fat weight, as well as cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels were evaluated. Malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1β and IL-6 levels, and &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression were also examined. Colonic infiltration by eosinophils, as well as substance P (SP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions were evaluated. Motor responses elicited under blockade of NOS and tachykininergic contractions were recorded &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; from colonic longitudinal muscle preparations.&lt;/p&gt; Key results &lt;p&gt;When compared to SD mice, HFD animals displayed increased body weight, epididymal fat weight and metabolic indexes. HFD mice showed increments in colonic MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 levels, as well as a decrease in &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in both colonic and epididymal tissues. HFD mice displayed an increase in colonic eosinophil infiltration. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in SP and iNOS expression in myenteric ganglia of HFD mice. In preparations from HFD mice, electrically evoked contractions upon NOS blockade or mediated by tachykininergic stimulation were enhanced. In HFD mice, Apigenin counteracted the increase in body and epididymal fat weight, as well as the alterations of metabolic indexes. Apigenin reduced also MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 colonic levels as well as eosinophil infiltration, SP and iNOS expression, along with a normalization of electrically evoked tachykininergic and nitrergic contractions. In addition, apigenin normalized &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in epididymal fat tissues, but not in colonic specimens.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions and implications &lt;p&gt;Apigenin prevents systemic metabolic alterations, counteracts enteric inflammation and normalizes colonic dysmotility associated with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195502</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>bd7e623b</fingerprint><crawled>1523468705371</crawled></item><item><published>1524196800000</published><title>[ASAP] The Structural Basis of Calcium-Dependent Inactivation of the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 5 Channel</title><author><name>Fedir M.

Transcription as the key step in gene expression is a highly regulated process. The speed of transcription elongation depends on the underlying gene sequence and varies on a gene by gene basis. The reason for this sequence dependence is not known in detail. Recently, our group studied the cross talk between the nascent RNA and the transcribing RNA polymerase by screening the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; genome for RNA sequences with high affinity to RNA Pol by performing genomic SELEX. This approach led to the identification of RNA polymerase-binding APtamers termed “RAPs”. RAPs can have positive and negative effects on gene expression. A subgroup is able to downregulate transcription via the activity of the termination factor Rho. In this study, we used a similar SELEX setup using yeast genomic DNA as source of RNA sequences and highly purified yeast RNA Pol II as bait and obtained almost 1300 yeast-derived RAPs. Yeast RAPs are found throughout the genome within genes and antisense to genes, they are overrepresented in the non-transcribed strand of yeast telomeres and underrepresented in intergenic regions. Genes harbouring a RAP are more likely to show lower mRNA levels. By determining the endogenous expression levels as well as using a reporter system, we show that RAPs located within coding regions can reduce the transcript level downstream of the RAP. Here we demonstrate that RAPs represent a novel type of regulatory RNA signal in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; that act in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and interfere with the elongating transcription machinery to reduce the transcriptional output.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1521838800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51c7:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eva Klopf, Murielle Moes, Fabian Amman, Bob Zimmermann, Frederike von Pelchrzim, Christina Wagner, Renée Schroeder&lt;/p&gt;

The hypothesis that pigs placed on diets with reduced indispensable amino acid (AA) content attempts to offset the reduction in the nutrient density with increased feed intake was tested. In the experiment, feeds with a high or a low AA content were administrated to pigs fed &lt;i&gt;ad-libitum&lt;/i&gt; or restrictively according to a 2 × 2 factorial design. Ninety-six barrows were housed in 8 pens (12 pigs/pen) equipped with automatic feeders. Within pen, and from 47 body weight (BW) onwards, 6 pigs were fed &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt;. The others pigs were allowed to consume, as a maximum, the feed amounts indicated by the breeding company feeding plane to optimize the feed efficiency. In early (86–118 kg BW) and late (118–145 kg BW) finishing, the pigs of 4 pens received feeds with high indispensable AA contents (8.1 and 7.5 g lysine/kg in the two periods, respectively). The other pigs received feeds with reduced indispensable AA contents (lysine, methionine, threonine and tryptophan) by 9 and 18% in early and late finishing, respectively. Body lipid and protein (Pr) retentions were estimated from BW and back-fat depth measures recorded at the beginning and the end of each period. Nitrogen excretion was estimated as actual intake minus estimated N-retention (Pr/6.25). Pigs were slaughtered at 144 kg BW. Restricted feeding decreased feed intake (-7%), daily gain (-5%), carcass weight (-2.6%) and back-fat depth (-8.0%) but increased gain:feed ratio (+2%). The AA restriction increased feed intake (+5.9%), carcass weight (+4.9%) and intramuscular fat (+17.6%), and reduced carcass weight variation (-36%), with no effects on the feed efficiency and the estimated Pr (142 g/d).

First, we applied a hierarchical cluster analysis and the principal component analysis (PCA) to a panel of questionnaires [comorbidity (Charlson, CIRS), clinical stability (MEWS), social frailty (Flugelman), cognitive dysfunction (SPSMQ), depression (5-item GDS), functional dependence (ADL, IADL, Barthel), risk of sore threats (Exton-Smith scale), nutrition (MNA), pain (NRPS), adherence to therapy (Morisky scale)], in order to select domains informative for the definition of complexity.

To evaluate SES&apos;s contribution to protein-solvent interaction we have applied our accurate and robust SES computation algorithm to various sets of proteins and ligand-protein interfaces. Our results show that each of the analyzed water-soluble proteins has a negative net charge on its SES. In addition we have identified a list of SES-defined physical and geometrical properties that likely pertain to protein solvation and folding based on their characteristic changes with protein size, their differences between folded and extended conformations, and their correlations with known hydrophobicity scales and with experimentally-determined protein solubility. The relevance of the list of SES-defined properties to protein structure and function is supported by their differences between water-soluble proteins and transmembrane proteins and between solvent-accessible regions and ligand-binding interfaces. Taken together our analyses reveal the importance of SES for protein solvation, folding and function. In particular the universal enrichment of negative charge and the larger than average SES area for a polar atom on the surface of a water-soluble protein suggest that from a protein-solvent interaction perspective to fold into a native state is to optimize the electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between solvent molecules and the surface polar atoms of a protein rather than to only minimize its apolar surface area.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294082v1?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162915cffce:9e2384b:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>The solvent-excluded surface (SES) of a protein is determined by and in turn affects protein-solvent interaction and consequently plays important roles in its solvation, folding and function.

In particular the universal enrichment of negative charge and the larger than average SES area for a polar atom on the surface of a water-soluble protein suggest that from a protein-solvent interaction perspective to fold into a native state is to optimize the electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between solvent molecules and the surface polar atoms of a protein rather than to only minimize its apolar surface area.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294082v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>b62e9ff3</fingerprint><crawled>1522857213902</crawled></item><item><published>1523404800000</published><title>SERS Comparison from Au, Ag, and Au-Ag Alloys: Insights by the First Principles</title><author><name>NA</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/SERS_Comparison_from_Au_Ag_and_Au-Ag_Alloys_Insights_by_the_First_Principles/6120962</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><summary><content>Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is presented via a case study of 2,2’-bipyridyl(22BPY) molecules adsorbed on pure Au and Ag as well as on Au-Ag alloy nanodiscs.

Networks in nature rarely function in isolation but instead interact with one another with a form of a network of networks (NoN). A network of networks with interdependency between distinct networks contains instability of abrupt collapse related to the global rule of activation. As a remedy of the collapse instability, here we investigate a model of correlated NoN. We find that the collapse instability can be removed when hubs provide the majority of interconnections and interconnections are convergent between hubs. Thus, our study identifies a stable structure of correlated NoN against catastrophic failures. Our result further suggests a plausible way to enhance network robustness by manipulating connection patterns, along with other methods such as controlling the state of node based on a local rule.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195539</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccae:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byungjoon Min, Muhua Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Use of virtual reality (VR) technology is often accompanied by a series of unwanted symptoms, including nausea and headache, which are characterised as ‘simulator sickness’. Sensory mismatch has been thought to lie at the heart of the problem and recent studies have shown that reducing cue mismatch in VR can have a therapeutic effect. Specifically, electrical stimulation of vestibular afferent nerves (galvanic vestibular stimulation; GVS) can reduce simulator sickness in VR. However, GVS poses a risk to certain populations and can also result in negative symptoms in normal, healthy individuals. Here, we tested whether noisy vestibular stimulation through bone-vibration can also reduce symptoms of simulator sickness. We carried out two experiments in which participants performed a spatial navigation task in VR and completed the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire over a series of trials. Experiment 1 was conducted using a high-end projection-based VR display, whereas Experiment 2 involved the use of a consumer head mounted display. During each trial, vestibular stimulation was either: 1) absent; 2) coupled with large angular accelerations of the projection camera; or 3) applied randomly throughout each trial. In half of the trials, participants actively navigated using a motion controller, and in the other half they were moved passively through the environment along pre-recorded motion trajectories. In both experiments we obtained lower simulator sickness scores when vestibular stimulation was coupled with angular accelerations of the camera. This effect was obtained for both active and passive movement control conditions, which did not differ. The results suggest that noisy vestibular stimulation can reduce simulator sickness, and that this effect appears to generalize across VR conditions. We propose further examination of this stimulation technique.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194137</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2812:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Séamas Weech, Jae Moon, Nikolaus F.

Among those strategies, Type IV effectors (T4Es) are proteins secreted by pathogenic bacteria to manipulate host cell processes during infection. They are delivered into eukaryotic cells in an ATP-dependent manner via the type IV secretion system, a specialized multiprotein complex. T4Es contain a wide spectrum of features including eukaryotic-like domains, localization signals or a C-terminal translocation signal. A combination of these features enables prediction of T4Es in a given bacterial genome. In this study, we developed a web-based comprehensive suite of tools with a user-friendly graphical interface. This version 2.0 of S4TE (Searching Algorithm for Type IV Effector Proteins; http://sate.cirad.fr) enables accurate prediction and comparison of T4Es. Search parameters and threshold can be customized by the user to work with any genome sequence, whether publicly available or not. Applications range from characterizing effector features and identifying potential T4Es to analyzing the effectors based on the genome G+C composition and local gene density. S4TE 2.0 allows the comparison of putative T4E repertoires of up to four bacterial strains at the same time. The software identifies T4E orthologs among strains and provides a Venn diagram and lists of genes for each intersection. New interactive features offer the best visualization of the location of candidate T4Es and hyperlinks to NCBI and Pfam databases. S4TE 2.0 is designed to evolve rapidly with the publication of new experimentally validated T4Es, which will reinforce the predictive power of the algorithm. The computational methodology can be used to identify a wide spectrum of candidate bacterial effectors that lack sequence conservation but have similar amino acid characteristics. This approach will provide very valuable information about bacterial host-specificity and virulence factors, and help identify host targets for the development of new anti-bacterial molecules.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301150v1?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162c4eefbaf:1e3bde9:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>4</engagement><description>Bacterial pathogens have evolved numerous strategies to corrupt, hijack or mimic cellular processes in order to survive and proliferate.

This approach will provide very valuable information about bacterial host-specificity and virulence factors, and help identify host targets for the development of new anti-bacterial molecules.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301150v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>5f36ca44</fingerprint><crawled>1523722419119</crawled></item><item><published>1522118290699</published><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25173?af=R</originId><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25173?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25173?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>False</unread><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626551ed0b:6ce03:76251cdd</id><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>acffb0cd</fingerprint><crawled>1522118290699</crawled></item><item><published>1522116490699</published><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25192?af=R</originId><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25192?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25192?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>False</unread><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162653675cb:6cdf4:76251cdd</id><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>883806d</fingerprint><crawled>1522116490699</crawled></item><item><published>1524258000000</published><title>The association of adult height with the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in the population of Sardinia</title><author><name>Giovanni Mario Pes</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0190888</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0190888</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Giovanni Mario Pes, Antonello Ganau, Eugenia Tognotti, Alessandra Errigo, Chiara Rocchi, Maria Pina Dore&lt;/p&gt;
The relationship between body height and the risk of non‒communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer has been the subject of much debate in the epidemiological literature. Concerns have recently arisen over spurious associations due to confounding factors like birth cohort, especially in the context of epidemiological transition. The population of Sardinia represents an interesting case study, as the average physical stature of inhabitants was the lowest recorded in Europe until a few decades ago. In this population we tested whether height is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cancer. We analysed the stature of 10,427 patients undergoing endoscopy for any reason, for whom a detailed clinical history of cardiovascular disease and/or malignancies had been documented. Poisson regression modelling was used to test the association between stature and disease risk. When patients were subdivided according to sex and height tertiles, the risk of cardiovascular disease proved significantly greater for subjects in the lowest tertile irrespective of sex (men: 1.87; 95%CI 1.41‒2.47; women: 1.23; 95%CI 0.92‒1.66) and smaller for those in the highest tertile (men: 0.51; 95%CI 0.35‒0.75; women: 0.41; 95%CI 0.27‒0.61). However, after adjusting the risk for birth cohort and established risk factors, it mostly resulted in non-significant values, although the overall trend persisted. Similar results were obtained for all-cancer risk (relative risk for men and women in the lowest tertile: 1.44; 95%CI 1.09–1.90 and 1.17; 95%CI 0.93–1.48, in the highest tertile: 0.51; 95%CI 0.36–0.72 and 0.62; 95%CI 0.47–0.81, respectively) as well as for some of the most common types of cancer. We concluded that the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and malignancies does not vary significantly with stature in the Sardinian population, after adjusting for birth cohort and more obvious risk factors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0190888</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7eb:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Giovanni Mario Pes, Antonello Ganau, Eugenia Tognotti, Alessandra Errigo, Chiara Rocchi, Maria Pina Dore&lt;/p&gt;

The immune state of wild animals is largely unknown. Knowing this and what affects it is important in understanding how infection and disease affects wild animals. The immune state of wild animals is also important in understanding the biology of their pathogens, which is directly relevant to explaining pathogen spillover among species, including to humans. The paucity of knowledge about wild animals&apos; immune state is in stark contrast to our exquisitely detailed understanding of the immunobiology of laboratory animals. Making an immune response is costly, and many factors (such as age, sex, infection status, and body condition) have individually been shown to constrain or promote immune responses. But, whether or not these factors affect immune responses and immune state in wild animals, their relative importance, and how they interact (or do not) are unknown. Here, we have investigated the immune ecology of wild house mice—the same species as the laboratory mouse—as an example of a wild mammal, characterising their adaptive humoral, adaptive cellular, and innate immune state. Firstly, we show how immune variation is structured among mouse populations, finding that there can be extensive immune discordance among neighbouring populations. Secondly, we identify the principal factors that underlie the immunological differences among mice, showing that body condition promotes and age constrains individuals’ immune state, while factors such as microparasite infection and season are comparatively unimportant. By applying a multifactorial analysis to an immune system-wide analysis, our results bring a new and unified understanding of the immunobiology of a wild mammal.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6q0s1nnNEUE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523653200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003538</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003538</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1523642773780</recrawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162c02eb7f8:4e48b:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephen Abolins, Luke Lazarou, Laura Weldon, Louise Hughes, Elizabeth C.

By applying a multifactorial analysis to an immune system-wide analysis, our results bring a new and unified understanding of the immunobiology of a wild mammal.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6q0s1nnNEUE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003538</originId><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>c5b1a7f5</fingerprint><crawled>1523642710008</crawled></item><item><published>1523948400000</published><title>Insights into aluminum-tolerance pathways in Stylosanthes as revealed by RNA-Seq analysis</title><author><name>Caode Jiang</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/il2TvvgGUSY/s41598-018-24536-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insights into aluminum-tolerance pathways in &lt;i&gt;Stylosanthes&lt;/i&gt; as revealed by RNA-Seq analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights into aluminum-tolerance pathways in &amp;lt;i&gt;Stylosanthes&amp;lt;/i&gt; as revealed by RNA-Seq analysis, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24536-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24536-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Insights into aluminum-tolerance pathways in &lt;i&gt;Stylosanthes&lt;/i&gt; as revealed by RNA-Seq analysis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/il2TvvgGUSY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24536-3</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24536-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24536-3/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24536_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><height>548</height></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162d2e9416e:304f586:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insights into aluminum-tolerance pathways in &lt;i&gt;Stylosanthes&lt;/i&gt; as revealed by RNA-Seq analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights into aluminum-tolerance pathways in &amp;lt;i&gt;Stylosanthes&amp;lt;/i&gt; as revealed by RNA-Seq analysis, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24536-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24536-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Insights into aluminum-tolerance pathways in &lt;i&gt;Stylosanthes&lt;/i&gt; as revealed by RNA-Seq analysis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/il2TvvgGUSY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24536-3</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>49511e2e</fingerprint><crawled>1523956924782</crawled></item><item><published>1522357200000</published><title>The changing relationship between marriage and childbearing in Hong Kong</title><author><name>Stuart Gietel-Basten</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194948</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194948</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stuart Gietel-Basten, Georgia Verropoulou&lt;/p&gt;
Births outside marriage (BoM) account for around 15% of all births globally. However, the distribution around the world is very uneven, as are cultural and political attitudes towards them. Studies from East Asia have shown that the percentage of such births is very low, with only modest increases in recent years. The orthodox demographic view holds that the maintenance of conservative views around the relationship between marriage and childbearing can play a role in keeping fertility low. Prenuptial pregnancies (PNP) (where births occur within eight months of marriage) have been identified as a growing phenomenon in Japan, possibly being an ‘alternative’ Asian pathway to family formation. As yet, no comprehensive statistical analysis of the trends of BoM or PNP has been performed for Hong Kong. Using a comprehensive microdata set of birth registration in Hong Kong from 1984–2015 (N = 1,680,831) we provide evidence of recent trends in such ‘alternative pathways’ to family formation and examine predictors through regression analysis. Our results indicate, in common with elsewhere in East Asia, low overall period rates of either BoM or PNP (although the latter has risen notably in recent years). While more recent birth cohorts exhibit higher prevalence of such births, their incomplete nature and higher expected propensity suggests that the figures are exaggerated. In our regression analysis, we find that lower educational attainment is a strong predictor of both BoM and PNP, suggesting that a bifurcation of experience may be occurring. This adds further evidence to the theory that the maintenance of traditional family formation systems in the context of revolutionised educational and work opportunities for women mean that the opportunity costs of the ‘marriage package’ become too high. Current disparities in rights and privileges between married and unmarried parents–and especially their children–means that targeted family planning services and support for vulnerable families are policy priorities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194948</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0f:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stuart Gietel-Basten, Georgia Verropoulou&lt;/p&gt;

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple marker of inflammation, has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation. However, whether it can be used to predict HCC development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative NLR for the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy. A total of 230 HBV-associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2012 were included in this study. Detailed clinical data included patients’ general characteristics, laboratory tests and imaging studies, surgical procedures and complications. Information on patients’ follow-up data was also obtained. We found that 38 (16.52%) patients developed HCC after splenectomy during the follow-up period. An elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of developing HCC in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for HCC development was 2.27. In patients who developed HCC during the follow-up period, NLR scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy. However, NLR scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop HCC. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195336</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4612:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqing Du, Jian Dong, Jianbin Bi, Ruhai Bai, Jia Zhang, Zheng Wu, Yi Lv, Xufeng Zhang, Rongqian Wu&lt;/p&gt;

In the event of an incident involving the release of a hazardous chemical, first responders may decide to initiate emergency decontamination in order to remove any contaminant from affected casualties. Recent initiatives such as the UK Home Office-led Initial Operational Response Programme have introduced new evidence-based decontamination protocols that reduce the time taken to initiate the decontamination process, including an increased emphasis on rapidly removing contaminated clothing (disrobe), and the use of improvised dry decontamination methods. The current study used a series of focus groups to examine public perceptions of different decontamination interventions and responder management strategies. Results revealed that a decontamination shower was perceived to be more effective than dry decontamination methods and that a management strategy that included effective responder communication resulted in increased willingness to comply with the need for decontamination. This study demonstrates that public understanding and acceptance of novel decontamination methods such as dry decontamination may present additional challenges for first responders. Increased emphasis on effective communication during decontamination is needed. Furthermore, provision of information during the focus group study resulted in an increase in participants’ knowledge and confidence in taking recommended decontamination actions, which was maintained three months after the study. The longitudinal nature of these effects suggest that it may be possible to increase public awareness about actions to take during chemical incidents by developing pre-incident public education; however, further research is needed to examine this more fully.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523653200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195922</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793639:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Holly Carter, Dale Weston, Naomi Betts, Simon Wilkinson, Richard Amlôt&lt;/p&gt;

Angiogenesis has been implicated in glomerular alterations in the early stage of diabetic nephropathy. We previously reported the renoprotective effects of vasohibin-1 (VASH1), which is a novel angiogenesis inhibitor derived from endothelial cells, on diabetic nephropathy progression. Vasohibin-2 (VASH2) was originally identified as a VASH1 homolog and possesses pro-angiogenic activity in contrast to VASH1. In addition, VASH2 was recently shown to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via enhanced transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling in cancer cells. Herein, we investigated the pathogenic roles of VASH2 in diabetic nephropathy using VAHS2-deficient mice. The type 1 diabetes model was induced by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin in VASH2 homozygous knockout (VASH2&lt;sup&gt;LacZ/LacZ&lt;/sup&gt;) or wild-type mice. These mice were euthanized 16 weeks after inducing hyperglycemia. Increased urine albumin excretion and creatinine clearance observed in diabetic wild-type mice were significantly prevented in diabetic VASH2-deficient mice. Accordingly, diabetes-induced increase in glomerular volume and reduction in glomerular slit-diaphragm density were significantly improved in VASH2 knockout mice. Increased glomerular endothelial area was also suppressed in VASH2-deficient mice, in association with inhibition of enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2), but not VEGF level. Furthermore, glomerular accumulation of mesangial matrix, including type IV collagen, and increased expression of TGF-β were improved in diabetic VASH2 knockout mice compared with diabetic wild-type mice. Based on the immunofluorescence findings, endogenous VASH2 localization in glomeruli was consistent with mesangial cells. Human mesangial cells (HMCs) were cultured under high glucose condition in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments. Transfection of VASH2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) into the HMCs resulted in the suppression of type IV collagen production induced by high glucose compared with control siRNA. These results indicate that VASH2 may be involved in diabetes-induced glomerular alterations, particularly impaired filtration barrier and mesangial expansion. Therefore, VASH2 is likely to represent a promising therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523480400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195779</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d4:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kana Masuda, Katsuyuki Tanabe, Haruyo Ujike, Norikazu Hinamoto, Hiromasa Miyake, Satoshi Tanimura, Hitoshi Sugiyama, Yasufumi Sato, Yohei Maeshima, Jun Wada&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is a thrombotic microangiopathy arising from consumption of both coagulation factors and platelets. DIC is triggered by a number of clinical conditions including severe infection, trauma and obstetric complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition is paramount. A high clinical index of suspicion is needed to ensure that patients at risk of developing DIC are appropriately investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In order to establish the clinical conditions most frequently associated with DIC, we reviewed all DIC screens received at a tertiary hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa over a 1 year period.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The commonest clinical condition associated with DIC in our population was infection with 84% of patients infected with an identified pathogen. The most frequently diagnosed pathogen was HIV followed by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; and other bacterial infections. In the majority of cases, bacteria were isolated from blood cultures. In 47 patients, HIV was the only pathogen which could be isolated. A relative risk ratio of 2.73 and an odds ratio of 29.97 was attributed to HIV for development of a DIC. A malignancy was present in 51 of the patients of which approximately 60% had co-existing infection. No cause could be attributed in 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Infection was identified in the majority of the patients diagnosed with DIC in this study. HIV showed the highest relative risk ratio of all pathogens although previous studies have not suggested that HIV was strongly associated with DIC. In almost half of the HIV infected patients, there was no other pathogen isolated despite extensive investigation. This suggests that HIV has a strong association with the development of DIC, warranting further research into the relationship between HIV and disseminated microvascular thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195793</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66cb:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth S.

However, a significant proportion of identified genetic variants are actually false positive calls, and this pose serious challenges for variants interpretation. Here, we propose a new tool named GARFIELD-NGS (Genomic vARiants FIltering by dEep Learning moDels in NGS), which rely on deep learning models to dissect false and true variants in exome sequencing experiments performed with Illumina or ION platforms. GARFIELD-NGS showed strong performances for both SNP and INDEL variants (AUC 0.71 - 0.98) and outperformed established hard filters. The method is robust also at low coverage down to 30X and can be applied on data generated with the recent Illumina two-colour chemistry.

However, a significant proportion of identified genetic variants are actually false positive calls, and this pose serious challenges for variants interpretation. Here, we propose a new tool named GARFIELD-NGS (Genomic vARiants FIltering by dEep Learning moDels in NGS), which rely on deep learning models to dissect false and true variants in exome sequencing experiments performed with Illumina or ION platforms. GARFIELD-NGS showed strong performances for both SNP and INDEL variants (AUC 0.71 - 0.98) and outperformed established hard filters. The method is robust also at low coverage down to 30X and can be applied on data generated with the recent Illumina two-colour chemistry. GARFIELD-NGS processes standard VCF file and produces a regular VCF output. Thus, it can be easily integrated in existing analysis pipeline, allowing application of different thresholds based on desired level of sensitivity and specificity.

GDSL lipase (GLIP) plays a pivotal role in plant cell growth as a multifunctional hydrolytic enzyme. Herein, a cotton (&lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; L. cv Xuzhou 142) GDSL lipase gene (&lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;) was obtained from developing ovules and fibers. The &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,143 base pairs (bp) and encodes a putative polypeptide of 380 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment indicated that GhGLIP includes four enzyme catalytic amino acid residue sites of Ser (S), Gly (G), Asn (N) and His (H), located in four conserved blocks. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that GhGLIP belongs to the typical class IV lipase family with potential functions in plant secondary metabolism. Subcellular distribution analysis demonstrated that GhGLIP localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm and plasma membrane. &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; was expressed predominantly at 5–15 day post anthesis (dpa) in developing ovules and elongating fibers, measured as mRNA levels and enzyme activity. Ectopic overexpression of &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; in Arabidopsis plants resulted in enhanced seed development, including length and fresh weight. Meanwhile, there was increased soluble sugar and protein storage in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, coupled with the promotion of lipase activity. Moreover, the expression of cotton &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; is induced by ethylene (ETH) treatment &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. A 1,954-bp &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; promoter was isolated and expressed high activity in driving green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression in tobacco leaves. &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting element analysis of the &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; promoter (&lt;i&gt;pGhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;) indicated the presence of an ethylene-responsive element (ERE), and transgenic tobacco leaves with ectopic expression of &lt;i&gt;pGhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP-GUS&lt;/i&gt; showed increased GUS activity after ETH treatment.

In tropical and subtropical lakes, eutrophication often leads to nuisance blooms of &lt;i&gt;Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii&lt;/i&gt;. In laboratory experiments, we tested the combined effects of flocculant polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB) on the sinking and growth rates of three &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of PAC and LMB would (1) effectively sink &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; in a test tube experiment and (2) impair &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; growth, irrespective of the biomass of the inoculum (bloom) and the strain in the growth experiment. We tested the recommended (LMB1) and a three-times higher dose of LMB (LMB3). The combined addition of PAC and LMB enhanced the sedimentation of all &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. Moreover, both the PAC and LMB doses decreased the phosphate concentration. PAC and LMB1 decreased the growth rate of all strains, but the efficacy depended on the biomass and strain. The combined addition of PAC and LMB3 inhibited the growth of all strains independently of the biomass and strain. We conclude that a low dose of PAC in combination with the recommended dose of LMB decreases &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; blooms and that the efficiency of the technique depends on the biomass of the bloom. A higher dose of LMB is needed to obtain a more efficient control of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; blooms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522789200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195359</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6d:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabiana Araújo, Frank van Oosterhout, Vanessa Becker, José Luiz Attayde, Miquel Lürling&lt;/p&gt;

A higher dose of LMB is needed to obtain a more efficient control of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; blooms.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195359</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>9e2682a2</fingerprint><crawled>1522777331269</crawled></item><item><published>1522813568000</published><title>Structure and dynamics of propylammonium nitrate-acetonitrile mixtures: An intricate multi-scale system probed with experimental and theoretical techniques</title><author><name>Marco Campetella</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021868?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021868?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b52:7c9981b6</id><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021868?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>4586cb60</fingerprint><crawled>1523085743269</crawled></item><item><published>1523662234000</published><title>Gene Therapy for Retinal Degeneration</title><author><name>NA</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><alternate><item><href>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0092867418303015%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dd7874939de6fef7be74d7395b2e692f6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418303015</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><summary><content>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell, Volume 173, Issue 1&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Rajendra S.

Despite the widespread acceptance of rotary blood pump (RBP) in clinical use over the past decades, the diminished flow pulsatility generated by a fixed speed RBP has been regarded as a potential factor that may lead to adverse events such as vasculature stiffening and hemorrhagic strokes. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of generating physiological pulse pressure in the pulmonary circulation by modulating the speed of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) in a mock circulation loop. A rectangular pulse profile with predetermined pulse width has been implemented as the pump speed pattern with two different phase shifts (0% and 50%) with respect to the ventricular contraction. In addition, the performance of the speed modulation strategy has been assessed under different cardiovascular states, including variation in ventricular contractility and pulmonary arterial compliance. Our results indicated that the proposed pulse profile with optimised parameters (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt; = 10000 rpm and &lt;i&gt;ω&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = 3000 rpm) was able to generate pulmonary arterial pulse pressure within the physiological range (9–15 mmHg) while avoiding undesirable pump backflow under both co- and counter-pulsation modes. As compared to co-pulsation, stroke work was reduced by over 44% under counter-pulsation, suggesting that mechanical workload of the right ventricle can be efficiently mitigated through counter-pulsing the pump speed. Furthermore, our results showed that improved ventricular contractility could potentially lead to higher risk of ventricular suction and pump backflow, while stiffening of the pulmonary artery resulted in increased pulse pressure. In conclusion, the proposed speed modulation strategy produces pulsatile hemodynamics, which is more physiologic than continuous blood flow. The findings also provide valuable insight into the interaction between RVAD speed modulation and the pulmonary circulation under various cardiovascular states.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195975</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fc:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Boon C.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine whether earlier time to initiation of aerobic exercise following acute concussion is associated with time to full return to (1) sport and (2) school or work.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A retrospective stratified propensity score survival analysis of acute (≤14 days) concussion was used to determine whether time (days) to initiation of aerobic exercise post-concussion was associated with, both, time (days) to full return to (1) sport and (2) school or work.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 253 acute concussions [median (IQR) age, 17.0 (15.0–20.0) years; 148 (58.5%) males] were included in this study. Multivariate Cox regression models identified that earlier time to aerobic exercise was associated with faster return to sport and school/work adjusting for other covariates, including quintile propensity strata. For each successive day in delay to initiation of aerobic exercise, individuals had a less favourable recovery trajectory. Initiating aerobic exercise at 3 and 7 days following injury was associated with a respective 36.5% (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53–0.76) and 73.2% (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16–0.45) reduced probability of faster full return to sport compared to within 1 day; and a respective 45.9% (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44–0.66) and 83.1% (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.10–0.30) reduced probability of faster full return to school/work. Additionally, concussion history, symptom severity, LOC deleteriously influenced concussion recovery.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Earlier initiation of aerobic exercise was associated with faster full return to sport and school or work.

p73 is a member of the p53 protein family and has essential functions in several signaling pathways involved in development, differentiation, DNA damage responses and cancer. As a transcription factor, p73 achieves these functions by binding to consensus DNA sequences and p73 shares at least partial target DNA binding sequence specificity with p53. Transcriptional activation by p73 has been demonstrated for more than fifty p53 targets in yeast and/or human cancer cell lines. It has also been shown previously that p53 binding to DNA is strongly dependent on DNA topology and the presence of inverted repeats that can form DNA cruciforms, but whether p73 transcriptional activity has similar dependence has not been investigated. Therefore, we evaluated p73 binding to a set of p53-response elements with identical theoretical binding affinity in their linear state, but different probabilities to form extra helical structures. We show by a yeast-based assay that transactivation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; correlated more with the relative propensity of a response element to form cruciforms than to its expected &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; DNA binding affinity. Structural features of p73 target sites are therefore likely to be an important determinant of its transactivation function.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195835</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccb6:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jana Čechová, Jan Coufal, Eva B.

Structural features of p73 target sites are therefore likely to be an important determinant of its transactivation function.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195835</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>60001a7d</fingerprint><crawled>1524073508287</crawled></item><item><published>1522268228000</published><title>Principles of Systems Biology, No. 27</title><author><name>NA</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><alternate><item><href>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301042%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D7ac6ecff18411c86177ebee94c79ed51</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471218301042</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><summary><content>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell Systems, Volume 6, Issue 3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Teaser&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301042%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D7ac6ecff18411c86177ebee94c79ed51</link><id>9eIPIKV4kOcW5lEUHqUkf3UaeBlngqwYuFsoLusj66Y=_1626e50e2f9:6c74e47:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell Systems, Volume 6, Issue 3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Teaser&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301042%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D7ac6ecff18411c86177ebee94c79ed51</originId><origin><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell Systems</title><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/24054712</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>f94cbcb3</fingerprint><crawled>1522269217529</crawled></item><item><published>1523343600000</published><title>Magnetically-driven phase transformation strengthening in high entropy alloys</title><author><name>Changning Niu</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/EwrN2Rt_rkI/s41467-018-03846-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magnetically-driven phase transformation strengthening in high entropy alloys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnetically-driven phase transformation strengthening in high entropy alloys, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03846-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03846-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Medium entropy alloy CoCrNi has better mechanical properties than high entropy alloys such as CrMnFeCoNi, but why that is remains unclear.

The annotation of small molecules is one of the most challenging and important steps in untargeted mass spectrometry analysis, as most of our biological interpretations rely on structural annotations. Molecular networking has emerged as a structured way to organize and mine data from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments and has been widely applied to propagate annotations. However, propagation is done through manual inspection of MS/MS spectra connected in the spectral networks and is only possible when a reference library spectrum is available. One of the alternative approaches used to annotate an unknown fragmentation mass spectrum is through the use of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions. One of the challenges of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; annotation is the uncertainty around the correct structure among the predicted candidate lists. Here we show how molecular networking can be used to improve the accuracy of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions through propagation of structural annotations, even when there is no match to a MS/MS spectrum in spectral libraries. This is accomplished through creating a network consensus of re-ranked structural candidates using the molecular network topology and structural similarity to improve &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; annotations.

Lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes (DM2) prevention implementation studies can be effective and lasting. Long-term weight loss maintenance enhances the intervention effect through a significant decrease in diabetes incidence over time. Our objective was to identify factors predicting long-term successful weight reduction maintenance achieved during a DM2 prevention program in patients with high DM2 risk in primary health care. Study participants (n = 263), middle-aged, slightly obese with baseline increased DM2 risk (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC)&gt;14), but no diabetes were invited to receive 11 lifestyle counselling sessions, guided physical activity sessions and motivational support during 10-months. The study participants had three clinical examinations during the study (baseline, one and three years). Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of weight reduction maintenance two years after the discontinuation of the intervention. Out of 105 patients who completed all three examinations (baseline age 56.6 (standard deviation (SD) = 10.7), body mass index 31.1 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (SD = 4.9), FINDRISC 18.6 (SD = 3.1)), 73 patients (70%) showed weight loss during the intervention (mean weight loss 4.2 kg, SD = 5.1). The total weight loss achieved in the maintainers (27 of 73 study participants) two years after the intervention had finished was 6.54 kg (4.47 kg+2.0 kg). The non-maintainers, on the other hand, returned to their initial weight at the start of the intervention (+0.21 kg). In multivariable analysis baseline history of increased glucose (odds ratio (OR) = 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–13.6) and reduction of total fat in diet during follow-up (OR = 4.3; 95% CI 1.5–12.2) were independent predictors of successful weight loss. Further studies exploring predictors of weight loss maintenance in diabetes prevention are needed to help health care providers to redesign interventions and improve long-term outcomes of real life interventions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1521838800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194589</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51cb:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska, Noël C.

Further studies exploring predictors of weight loss maintenance in diabetes prevention are needed to help health care providers to redesign interventions and improve long-term outcomes of real life interventions.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194589</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>a15c8eea</fingerprint><crawled>1521826743954</crawled></item><item><published>1522345097000</published><title>AAAS Annual Meeting examines need for diversity in science</title><author><name>Jarvis, M.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1478?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1478.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1478?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c84:34f43e70</id><engagement>62</engagement><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1478?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>f51191b5</fingerprint><crawled>1522347550579</crawled></item><item><published>1522906303000</published><title>Communication: Fast dynamics perspective on the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein law in fragile glassformers</title><author><name>F.

Background &lt;p&gt;The growing shale gas (“fracking”) industry depends on a mobile workforce, whose influx could have social impacts on host communities. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This first report of a link between shale gas activity and increased rates of both chlamydia and gonorrhea may inform local policies and community health efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1521838800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194203</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51c1:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicole C.

Pathogen genome sequencing can reveal details of transmission histories and is a powerful tool in the fight against infectious disease. In particular, within-host pathogen genomic variants identified through heterozygous nucleotide base calls are a potential source of information to identify linked cases and infer direction and time of transmission. However, using such data effectively to model disease transmission presents a number of challenges, including differentiating genuine variants from those observed due to sequencing error, as well as the specification of a realistic model for within-host pathogen population dynamics. Here we propose a new Bayesian approach to transmission inference, BadTrIP (BAyesian epiDemiological TRansmission Inference from Polymorphisms), that explicitly models evolution of pathogen populations in an outbreak, transmission (including transmission bottlenecks), and sequencing error. BadTrIP enables the inference of host-to-host transmission from pathogen sequencing data and epidemiological data. By assuming that genomic variants are unlinked, our method does not require the computationally intensive and unreliable reconstruction of individual haplotypes. Using simulations we show that BadTrIP is robust in most scenarios and can accurately infer transmission events by efficiently combining information from genetic and epidemiological sources; thanks to its realistic model of pathogen evolution and the inclusion of epidemiological data, BadTrIP is also more accurate than existing approaches. BadTrIP is distributed as an open source package (https://bitbucket.org/nicofmay/badtrip) for the phylogenetic software BEAST2. We apply our method to reconstruct transmission history at the early stages of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, showcasing the power of within-host genomic variants to reconstruct transmission events.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rbi3PORvpr0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006117</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006117</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1524084125569</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162d9eb5eb9:b6ef0:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicola De Maio, Colin J.

Recent comparative genomics studies have suggested that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of the major processes in bacterial evolution. In this study, HGT events of 64 &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; strains were investigated based on the pipeline employed in HGTree database constructed in our recent study. Tree reconciliation method was applied in order to calculate feasible HGT events. Following initial detection and an evaluation procedure, evidence of the HGT was identified in 548 gene families including 42 gene families transferred from outside of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydiae&lt;/i&gt; phylum with high reliability. The donor species of inter-phylum HGT consists of 12 different bacterial and archaeal phyla, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; might have even more various host range than in previous reports. In addition, each species of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; showed varying preference towards HGT, and genes engaged in HGT within &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; and between other species showed different functional distribution. Also, examination of individual gene flows of niche-specific genes suggested that many of such genes are transferred mainly within &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genus. Our results uncovered novel features of HGT acting on &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genome evolution, and it would be also strong evidence that HGT is an ongoing process for intracellular pathogens. We expect that the results provide more insight into lineage- and niche-specific adaptations regarding their infectivity and pathogenicity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195139</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f45fc:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyaekang Kim, Woori Kwak, Sook Hee Yoon, Dae-Kyung Kang, Heebal Kim&lt;/p&gt;

For CyberKnife-mediated prostate cancer treatment, a tumour-tracking approach is applied to correct the target location by acquiring X-ray images of implanted fiducial markers intermittently. This study investigated the dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion during CyberKnife treatment. We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients treated using the CyberKnife (35 Gy delivered in five fractions). Using log files of recorded prostate motion, the intra-fraction prostate motion was simulated. We defined the worst-case intra-fraction prostate motion as the difference between pre- and post-deviation on log files and shifted structure sets according to the corresponding offsets for each beam. The dose–volume indices were calculated and compared with the original plan in terms of clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (CTV plus a 2-mm margin), rectum, bladder, and urethra. Prostate motions of &gt;3, &gt;5, and &gt;10 mm were observed for 31.3, 9.1, and 0.5% of the 1929 timestamps, respectively. Relative differences between the simulated and original plans were mostly less than 1%. Although significant decreases were observed in D&lt;sub&gt;50%&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;98%&lt;/sub&gt; of the target, absolute dose differences were &amp;lt;0.1 Gy compared with the planned dose. The dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion may be small even with longer treatment durations, indicating that the tumour tracking using the CyberKnife could be a robust system for examining prostate motion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195296</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4609:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuhei Koike, Iori Sumida, Hirokazu Mizuno, Hiroya Shiomi, Keita Kurosu, Seiichi Ota, Yasuo Yoshioka, Osamu Suzuki, Keisuke Tamari, Kazuhiko Ogawa&lt;/p&gt;

In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of repeated brain metastases (BM) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS2) following local failure of a prior radiosurgical procedure (SRS1). Between December 1996 and August 2015, 30 patients with 36 BM underwent SRS2 with a median dose of 18Gy. All BM were located outside critical structures. Following SRS2, local control at 6 months and one year were respectively 82.9% (IC 95%: 67.6–91.9) and 67.8% (IC 95%: 51–81). On multivariate analysis, planning target volume (PTV) &amp;lt; 3cc (HR: 0.19 (0.1–0.52)) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) prior to SRS2 (HR: 0.25 (0.1–0.64)) were significantly associated with a better local control. One- and two-year overall survival rates after SRS2 were respectively 65.5% (IC 95%: 47.3–80%) and 27.6% (IC 95%: 14.7–45.7). Median overall survival following SRS2 was 14.2 months (range 1–106). Nineteen (63%) patients died from progressive systemic disease. Three (10%) patients died from out-field progressive brain disease and 8 (27%) in-field. Concerning toxicities, edema, radionecrosis, and hemorrhages were identified in 5 (12.8%), 4 (10.2%), and 5 (12.8%) patients respectively. No toxicity resulted in a neurological deficit. On univariate analysis, toxicities were significantly associated with PTV &gt; 7cc (p = 0.02) and all patients had a WBRT before SRS2. A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases showed encouraging rates of local control. This treatment led to acceptable toxicities, especially for brain metastases smaller than 7cc, in our selected cohort of patients with BM located outside critical structures.

Background &lt;p&gt;A prospective Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program has been implemented in Korea to improve the quality and safety of medication use.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the influence of the DUR program in reducing incidence of preventable adverse drug reactions (pADRs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was performed using administrative data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA). The claims data for all adult patients with adverse drug events (ADE)-related diagnoses from 2009 to 2014 were obtained. Incidence rates of first-time and repeat pADRs prior to and after DUR program implementation were evaluated. Quarterly trends in incidence rates of overall ADE, allergic reactions, and ADRs were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data extraction covering the period from 2009 to 2014 led to the identification of 3,927,662 records. First-time pADR rates decreased gradually after implementation of the DUR program (change in slope: -0.016, p = 0.02). The program had a similar influence on repeat pADR rates (change in slope: -0.006, p≤0.01). The program did not decrease rates of first-time or repeat allergic reactions (change in slope: 0.018, p = 0.07 and 0.003, p = 0.04, respectively). In the cohort aged ≤65 years, first-time pADR rate reduction was significant (28.2% [27.1–29.3] in ≤18 years, and 19.8% [18.1–21.5] in 19–64 years). In contrast, first-time pADR rate was increased by 0.6% [-0.7–1.9] in patients ≥65 years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Implementation of the prospective DUR program effectively reduced the number of pADRs.

Understanding the determinants of syntactic choice in sentence production is a salient topic in psycholinguistics. Existing evidence suggests that syntactic choice results from an interplay between linguistic and non-linguistic factors, and a speaker’s attention to the elements of a described event represents one such factor. Whereas multimodal accounts of attention suggest a role for different modalities in this process, existing studies examining attention effects in syntactic choice are primarily based on visual cueing paradigms. Hence, it remains unclear whether attentional effects on syntactic choice are limited to the visual modality or are indeed more general. This issue is addressed by the current study. Native English participants viewed and described line drawings of simple transitive events while their attention was directed to the location of the agent or the patient of the depicted event by means of either an &lt;i&gt;auditory&lt;/i&gt; (monaural beep) or a &lt;i&gt;motor&lt;/i&gt; (unilateral key press) lateral cue. Our results show an effect of cue location, with participants producing more passive-voice descriptions in the patient-cued conditions. Crucially, this cue location effect emerged in the motor-cue but not (or substantially less so) in the auditory-cue condition, as confirmed by a reliable interaction between &lt;i&gt;cue location&lt;/i&gt; (agent vs. patient) and &lt;i&gt;cue type&lt;/i&gt; (auditory vs. motor).

Background &lt;p&gt;Decreased but measurable serum IgA levels (≤70 mg/dL) have been associated with risk for infections in some populations, but are unstudied in COPD. This study tested the hypothesis that subnormal serum IgA levels would be associated with exacerbation risk in COPD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data were analyzed from 1,049 COPD participants from the observational cohort study SPIROMICS (535 (51%) women; mean age 66.1 (SD 7.8), 338 (32%) current smokers) who had baseline serum IgA measured using the Myriad RBM biomarker discovery platform. Exacerbation data was collected prospectively (mean 944.3 (SD 281.3) days), and adjusted linear, logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions were performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean IgA was 269.1 mg/dL (SD 150.9). One individual had deficient levels of serum IgA (&amp;lt;7 mg/dL) and 25 (2.4%) had IgA level ≤70 mg/dL. Participants with IgA ≤70 mg/dL were younger (62 vs. 66 years, p = 0.01) but otherwise similar to those with higher IgA. In adjusted models, IgA ≤70 mg/dL was associated with higher exacerbation incidence rates (IRR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01–2.87, p = 0.044) and greater risk for any severe exacerbation (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.30–6.94, p = 0.010).

Background &lt;p&gt;Decreased but measurable serum IgA levels (≤70 mg/dL) have been associated with risk for infections in some populations, but are unstudied in COPD. This study tested the hypothesis that subnormal serum IgA levels would be associated with exacerbation risk in COPD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data were analyzed from 1,049 COPD participants from the observational cohort study SPIROMICS (535 (51%) women; mean age 66.1 (SD 7.8), 338 (32%) current smokers) who had baseline serum IgA measured using the Myriad RBM biomarker discovery platform. Exacerbation data was collected prospectively (mean 944.3 (SD 281.3) days), and adjusted linear, logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions were performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean IgA was 269.1 mg/dL (SD 150.9). One individual had deficient levels of serum IgA (&amp;lt;7 mg/dL) and 25 (2.4%) had IgA level ≤70 mg/dL. Participants with IgA ≤70 mg/dL were younger (62 vs. 66 years, p = 0.01) but otherwise similar to those with higher IgA. In adjusted models, IgA ≤70 mg/dL was associated with higher exacerbation incidence rates (IRR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01–2.87, p = 0.044) and greater risk for any severe exacerbation (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.30–6.94, p = 0.010). In adjusted models among those in the lowest decile (&amp;lt;120 mg/dL), each 10 mg/dL decrement in IgA (analyzed continuously) was associated with more exacerbations during follow-up (β 0.24, 95% CI 0.017–0.46, p = 0.035).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Subnormal serum IgA levels were associated with increased risk for acute exacerbations, supporting mildly impaired IgA levels as a contributing factor in COPD morbidity. Additionally, a dose-response relationship between lower serum IgA and number of exacerbations was found among individuals with serum IgA in the lowest decile, further supporting the link between serum IgA and exacerbation risk.

Many catabolic stimuli, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) in combination with oncostatin M (OSM), promote cartilage breakdown via the induction of collagen-degrading collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (&lt;i&gt;MMP1&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; in human articular chondrocytes. Indeed, joint diseases with an inflammatory component are characterised by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) catabolism. Importantly, protein kinase C (PKC) signalling has a primary role in cytokine-induced &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt; expression, and is known to regulate cellular functions associated with pathologies involving ECM remodelling. At present, substrates downstream of PKC remain undefined. Herein, we show that both IL-1- and OSM-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase D (PKD) in human chondrocytes is strongly associated with signalling via the atypical PKCι isoform. Consequently, inhibiting PKD activation with a pan-PKD inhibitor significantly reduced the expression of &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Specific gene silencing of the PKD isoforms revealed that only PKD3 (&lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt;) depletion mirrored the observed &lt;i&gt;MMP&lt;/i&gt; repression, indicative of the pharmacological inhibitor specifically affecting only this isoform. &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing was also shown to reduce serine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as phosphorylation of all three mitogen-activated protein kinase groups. This altered signalling following &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing led to a significant reduction in the expression of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) genes &lt;i&gt;FOS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JUN&lt;/i&gt;, critical for the induction of many MMPs including &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the AP-1 factor activating transcription factor 3 (&lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt;) was also reduced concomitant with the observed reduction in &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; expression.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The inconclusive clinical results for ST-waveform analysis (STAN) in detecting fetal hypoxemia may be caused by the signal processing of the STAN-device itself. We assessed the performance of a clinical STAN device in signal processing and in detecting hypoxemia in a fetal sheep model exposed to prolonged umbilical cord occlusion (UCO).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight fetal lambs were exposed to 25 minutes of UCO. ECG recordings were analyzed during a baseline period and during UCO. STAN-event rates and timing of episodic T/QRS rise, baseline T/QRS rise and the occurrence of biphasic ST-waveforms, as well as signal loss, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During baseline conditions of normoxemia, a median of 40 (IQR, 25–70) STAN-events per minute were detected, compared to 10 (IQR, 2–22) during UCO. During UCO STAN-events were detected in five subjects within 10 minutes and in six subjects after 18 minutes, respectively. Two subjects did not generate any STAN-event during UCO. Biphasic ST event rate was reduced during UCO (median 0, IQR 0–5), compared to baseline (median 32, IQR, 6–55). ST-waveforms could not be assessed in 62% of the recording time during UCO, despite a good quality of the ECG signal.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The STAN device showed limitations in detecting hypoxemia in fetal sheep after prolonged UCO. The STAN device produced high false positive event rates during baseline and did not detect T/QRS changes adequately after prolonged fetal hypoxemia. During 14% of baseline and 62% of the UCO period, the STAN-device could not process the ECG signal, despite its good quality. Resolving these issues may improve the clinical performance of the STAN device.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195978</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aef:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Andriessen, Alex Zwanenburg, Judith O.

Penile acquisition of HIV infection contributes substantially to the global epidemic. Our goal was to establish a preclinical macaque model of penile HIV infection for evaluating the efficacy of new HIV prevention modalities. Rhesus macaques were challenged once or twice weekly with consistent doses of SHIV&lt;sub&gt;sf&lt;/sub&gt;162P3 (a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus containing HIV &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt;) ranging from 4–600 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (50% tissue culture infective dose), via two penile routes, until systemic SHIV infection was confirmed. One route exposed the inner foreskin, glans and urethral os to virus following deposition into the prepuce (foreskin) pouch. The second route introduced the virus non-traumatically into the distal urethra only. Single-route challenges resulted in dose-dependent rates of SHIV acquisition informing selection of optimal SHIV dosing. Concurrent SHIV challenges via the prepuce pouch (200 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and urethra (16 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) resulted in infection of 100% (10/10) animals following a median of 2.5 virus exposures (range, 1–12). We describe the first rhesus macaque repeat-exposure SHIV challenge model of penile HIV acquisition. Utilization of the model should further our understanding of penile HIV infection and facilitate the development of new HIV prevention strategies for men.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522184400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194837</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f12:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by David A.

If you’ve heard him speak on the topic of organic synthesis, you’ve probably heard most of what’s in that piece, but it’s a good summary of his position. Picked up roughly where I left off last time, he has this to say about innovation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One measure of the health of a scientific field is its ability to generate new ideas (as opposed to extensions of already established themes), and to reinvent itself. A familiar idea in discussions of innovation is that it comes in different forms: for example, innovation can focus on new technology (where organic synthesis has tended to shine), or on new processes (where the most innovative work has often been done by process‐development groups in industry), or new business plans (for example, the decision by China to make low‐cost capital available for production of silicon‐based solar cells – a decision that has been enormously important in accelerating the implementation of solar energy). The question facing organic synthesis is not “has the need for new methods of syntheses disappeared?” but rather “What problems – intellectual, empirical, or practical – most require new ideas in synthesis?” Is the future for more of the familiar – what Kuhn called “ordinary science” – or for something more radical, more important, more different fundamentally? (More, perhaps, having the audacity of what Woodward, Eschenmoser, and others suggested and demonstrated 50 years ago?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an uncomfortable question, when you start to think about it. That’s not asking organic chemists what they can do, but what the most important and interesting questions are that they can contribute to. And it’s also asking, “Of the biggest and most important questions in general, which ones can organic synthesis help with?” Whitesides lists some of those in broad strokes (catalysis, materials science, synthetic biology, automation/mechanization of organic chemistry, etc.) and in more particular ones (molecular recognition, origin of life studies, sequence-specific polymers, new biocompatible materials, and more). It may or may not be a coincidence that what many people think of when they think of “organic synthesis” – total synthesis of natural products – does not impinge nearly as much on these topics as some of its practitioners might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the most important questions that natural products synthesis can provide a key role in helping to answer? One that I can think of is unraveling complex biochemical pathways where more simple chemical matter just doesn’t seem to be able to make things clear. I would adduce rapamycin and FK-506 as examples of this, and there are many others. Indeed, some of the larger pharmaceutical molecules are getting into “non-natural-product” zones of complexity and molecular weight (although, to be sure, they’re generally much easier to make, since we’ve produced them (or their precursors) with that in mind. Modifications of the natural products themselves is another such field, and it’s not an easy one, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are worthy topics, and there are others. But at this point, I want to being in &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b02266&quot;&gt;another recent article&lt;/a&gt;, from Phil Baran at Scripps, introducing a special collection of total organic synthesis papers. This introduction is written by someone who’s well acquainted with criticism of the field. Interestingly, he and Whitesides are in agreement on what some of the interesting problems are (automation being one example), but that agreement definitely doesn’t go all the way. That’s because Baran’s article, as mentioned, is deliberately written as a defense of total synthesis, and it reads at times like a response to a prosecutor’s opening statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with some of what Prof. Baran has to say as well. I think, for example, that he’s absolutely right when he says that the application of AI and automation to really complex molecules is still a long way off. We might disagree on just what a “long way” measures out to, but there’s no doubt that retrosynthetic planning of such molecules and their actual forward synthesis is a really significant challenge that only humans – and pretty damned competent humans, at that – are now able to meet. (Drug-sized molecules are another matter). Of course, Prof. Baran and I are in agreement about many other points as well, a big one (mentioned above) being the use of such complex molecules to work out biochemical pathways. There’s often no alternative, and there are several fields that would be in much worse shape if synthetic chemistry hadn’t evolved far enough to deal with such structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key place where I think Baran and Whitesides, though, do not really come to a meeting of the minds is in the question of “Why?” Some of the responses given in Baran’s article – total synthesis trains students well, industry likes to hire people who do it, it’s a solid way to prove compound structures, it’s beautiful in and of itself –  are the same justifications I was given when I was first working in the field in the mid-1980s. And it’s not that time has falsified all of these, but it may have made some of them a bit less compelling. It may seem odd to say it, but for some time I bought into this worldview completely, and even now I don’t completely reject it. But sometimes, I think it seems to the total synthesis community that you’re either for them or against them, and that apostasy is always a short, fatal, step away. The shortest and most fatal of those steps is wondering in general if total synthesis of natural products still pays its way, scientifically. Here’s Whitesides again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The trick will be to find classes of problems that return complex synthesis (Organic Synthesis, perhaps in an evolved and more expansive and ambitious form) to a central role in the future of the field, rather than having it become an extraordinary specialty or craft, admired but occupying an increasingly isolated place as the rest of synthesis moves on. The argument that complex synthesis, by itself, is beautiful is doubtless true, but also dangerous. Most societies have valued beautiful products of human imagination and skill, but paying to support the artists who produce them has been another matter entirely. And, unfortunately, the beauty of Organic Synthesis is not something that most non‐synthetic‐chemists can understand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technical expertise is not, by itself, enough to sustain a field (consider mechanical watchmaking or glass‐blowing). To prosper, Organic Synthesis must also solve recognizable problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That exact argument for beauty is one of the ones made in Prof. Baran’s article, actually. It’s not his main point – actually his main points and those of Prof. Whitesides might well end up being closer than you’d think – but it does represent the sort of sticking point that keeps coming up between practioners of the field and those outside it. I’m outside it, and have been for many years. I can understand it and appreciate many of its qualities, but I’m not able – unfortunately – to tell people that its best days are yet to come. They might be. But they might not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><summary><content>The other day I wrote up some comments about a recent article from George Whitesides.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition for which there are currently no medical therapies other than supportive care involving the application of mechanical ventilation. However, mechanical ventilation itself can worsen ARDS by damaging the alveolocapillary barrier in the lungs. This allows plasma-derived fluid and proteins to leak into the airspaces of the lung where they interfere with the functioning of pulmonary surfactant, which increases the stresses of mechanical ventilation and worsens lung injury. Once such ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is underway, managing ARDS and saving the patient becomes increasingly problematic. Maintaining an intact alveolar barrier thus represents a crucial management goal, but the biophysical processes that perforate this barrier remain incompletely understood. To study the dynamics of barrier perforation, we subjected initially normal mice to an injurious ventilation regimen that imposed both volutrauma (overdistension injury) and atelectrauma (injury from repetitive reopening of closed airspaces) on the lung, and observed the rate at which macromolecules of various sizes leaked into the airspaces as a function of the degree of overall injury. Computational modeling applied to our findings suggests that perforations in the alveolocapillary barrier appear and progress according to a rich-get-richer mechanism in which the likelihood of a perforation getting larger increases with the size of the perforation. We suggest that atelectrauma causes the perforations after which volutrauma expands them. This mechanism explains why atelectrauma appears to be essential to the initiation of VILI in a normal lung, and why atelectrauma and volutrauma then act synergistically once VILI is underway.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193934</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2808:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Katharine L.

E487K point mutation of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2 (ALDH2*2) in East Asians intrinsically lowers ALDH2 activity. ALDH2*2 is associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetic patients exhibit heart failure of preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) i.e. while the systolic heart function is preserved in them, they may exhibit diastolic dysfunction, implying a jeopardized myocardial health. Currently, it is challenging to detect cardiac functional deterioration in diabetic mice. Stress echocardiography (echo) in the clinical set-up is a procedure used to measure cardiac reserve and impaired cardiac function in coronary artery diseases. Therefore, we hypothesized that high-fat diet fed type-2 diabetic ALDH2*2 mutant mice exhibit HFpEF which can be measured by cardiac echo stress test methodology. We induced type-2 diabetes in 12-week-old male C57BL/6 and ALDH2*2 mice through a high-fat diet. At the end of 4 months of DM induction, we measured the cardiac function in diabetic and control mice of C57BL/6 and ALDH2*2 genotypes by conscious echo. Subsequently, we imposed exercise stress by allowing the mice to run on the treadmill until exhaustion. Post-stress, we measured their cardiac function again. Only after treadmill running, but not at rest, we found a significant decrease in % fractional shortening and % ejection fraction in ALDH2*2 mice with diabetes compared to C57BL/6 diabetic mice as well as non-diabetic (control) ALDH2*2 mice. The diabetic ALDH2*2 mice also exhibited poor maximal running speed and distance. Our data suggest that high-fat fed diabetic ALDH2*2 mice exhibit HFpEF and treadmill exercise stress echo test is able to determine this HFpEF in the diabetic ALDH2*2 mice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195796</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f9:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guodong Pan, Srikar Munukutla, Ananya Kar, Joseph Gardinier, Rajarajan A.

Open-cut coal mining in Queensland results in the formation of extensive saline overburden spoil-piles with steep slopes at the angle of repose (approximately 75% or 37&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;). These spoil-piles are generally found in multiple rows, several kilometers in length and heights of up to 50 or 60 m above the original landscape. They are highly dispersive and erodible. Legislation demands that these spoil piles be rehabilitated to minimize on-site and off-site discharges of sediment and salt into the surrounding environment. To achieve this, the steep slopes must be reduced, stabilized against erosion, covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. Key design criteria (slope gradient, slope length and vegetation cover) are required for the construction of post-mining landscapes that will result in acceptable erosion rates.
A novel user-friendly hillslope computer model MINErosion 3.4 was developed that can accurately predict potential erosion rates from field scale hillslopes using parameters measured with a 3m laboratory tilting flume-rainfall simulator or using routinely measured soil physical and chemical properties. This model links MINErosion 2 with a novel consolidation and above ground vegetation cover factors, to the RUSLE and MUSLE equations to predict the mean annual and storm event erosion rates. The RUSLE-based prediction of the mean annual erosion rates allow minesites to derive the key design criteria of slope length, slope gradient and vegetation cover that would lead to acceptable erosion rates. The MUSLE-based prediction of storm event erosion rates will be useful as input into risk analysis of potential damage from erosion.
MINErosion 3.4 was validated against erosion measured on 20 m field erosion plots established on post-mining landscapes at the Oakey Creek and Curragh coalmines, as well as on 120 and 70 m erosion plots on postmining landscapes at Kidston Gold Mine.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194230</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2817:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hwat Bing So, Ashraf M.

Legislation demands that these spoil piles be rehabilitated to minimize on-site and off-site discharges of sediment and salt into the surrounding environment. To achieve this, the steep slopes must be reduced, stabilized against erosion, covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. Key design criteria (slope gradient, slope length and vegetation cover) are required for the construction of post-mining landscapes that will result in acceptable erosion rates.
A novel user-friendly hillslope computer model MINErosion 3.4 was developed that can accurately predict potential erosion rates from field scale hillslopes using parameters measured with a 3m laboratory tilting flume-rainfall simulator or using routinely measured soil physical and chemical properties. This model links MINErosion 2 with a novel consolidation and above ground vegetation cover factors, to the RUSLE and MUSLE equations to predict the mean annual and storm event erosion rates. The RUSLE-based prediction of the mean annual erosion rates allow minesites to derive the key design criteria of slope length, slope gradient and vegetation cover that would lead to acceptable erosion rates. The MUSLE-based prediction of storm event erosion rates will be useful as input into risk analysis of potential damage from erosion.
MINErosion 3.4 was validated against erosion measured on 20 m field erosion plots established on post-mining landscapes at the Oakey Creek and Curragh coalmines, as well as on 120 and 70 m erosion plots on postmining landscapes at Kidston Gold Mine.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194230</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>929e6cd3</fingerprint><crawled>1522259109027</crawled></item><item><published>1522713600000</published><title>Functional roles of Mg2+ binding sites in ion-dependent gating of a Mg2+ channel, MgtE, revealed by solution NMR</title><author><name>shimada@iw-nmr.f.u-tokyo.ac.jp (Andrès D Maturana)</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31596</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31596</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><summary><content>Magnesium ions (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) are divalent cations essential for various cellular functions.

Current rates of species loss triggered numerous attempts to protect and conserve biodiversity. Species conservation, however, requires species identification skills, a competence obtained through intensive training and experience. Field researchers, land managers, educators, civil servants, and the interested public would greatly benefit from accessible, up-to-date tools automating the process of species identification. Currently, relevant technologies, such as digital cameras, mobile devices, and remote access to databases, are ubiquitously available, accompanied by significant advances in image processing and pattern recognition. The idea of automated species identification is approaching reality.

The concurrent structural and functional findings suggest that CPCB-RPE1 may improve visual function, at least in the short term, in some patients with severe vision loss from advanced NNAMD.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/435/eaao4097?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>bbcb03f3</fingerprint><crawled>1522865278868</crawled></item><item><published>1522945659000</published><title>More on Crystal Formation (This Time With Proteins)</title><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/05/more-on-crystal-formation-this-time-with-proteins</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/05/more-on-crystal-formation-this-time-with-proteins</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Analytical Chemistry</item><item>Chemical News</item></keywords><content><content>&lt;p&gt;I realize that I was just talking about crystal formation here &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/28/down-at-the-crystal-surface&quot;&gt;the other day&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s yet more news in the area, and it comes in the fiendishly difficult area of protein crystallography. All you have to do to appreciate the horrors of this field is to step into a lab that does it for a living: stacks and stacks and stacks of plates, each with a slightly different set of conditions (buffers, concentrations, additives, protein construct, and son on) to try, once again, to get a protein crystal that diffracts well enough for structure determination. It’s especially tricky to get the ones with your small molecule sitting inside them at its binding site, but when you do, the payoffs can be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing such things at the quality levels needed, though, is an absolute black art. There are trends (sometimes), better ideas about starting points (sometimes), rational modifications of the protein sequence to increase your chances (sometimes), but in the end, it still comes down to relentless empirical try-it-and-see. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25971&quot;&gt;latest paper&lt;/a&gt; (writeup by &lt;em&gt;C&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i15/Cryo-electron-microscopy-reveals-protein.html?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=CEN&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is looking at a well-known protein crystal (glucose isomerase) that is also well known to exist it two polymorphic forms (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/28/down-at-the-crystal-surface&quot;&gt;that last post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject for more on polymorphs). What isn’t well known is why it forms these particular two types of crystals and how that happens. In virtually every case of polymorphism, we have little or no clue about such things, and I’m very glad to see clues starting to be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these authors have done is to start the crystallization process in ammonium sulfate solution and then freeze the solutions (liquid nitrogen) at various time points, imaging the crystals thus found by electron microscopy. And there are some surprises. At the twenty-second time point, there are already “nanorod” crystals forming, which are, on the average, &lt;em&gt;two protein molecules wide and twelve molecules long&lt;/em&gt;. You are not going to get too much earlier in the crystal formation process than that. The concentration of the nanorods increases over time. However, their length does not: they seem stuck at this size. They do start to associate into fibrils as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other things happening as well. There are other species in there (trimer, tetramers, single-file chains), and after about thirty minutes you can also see faceted nanocrystals of the two known bulk polymorphs, one prismatic and rodlike and one rhombic. The smallest of each are in the 100 nM range along their shortest edges. Trying the experiment using PEG instead of ammonium sulfate (another known set of conditions for producing these protein crystals) shows that the useful concentration range for the additive is much narrower, but in both cases, at the low end of the range you get rhombic, and at the high end you get prismatic. With PEG, though, if you keep pushing it, you get no crystals at all, but rather an amorphous gel-like state. And in none of the PEG experiments did they ever observe the nanorods seen in ammonium sulfate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That gelation pathway seemed to involve fibril formation as well, which looked in the earlier experiments like it might be a precursor to formation of the rhombic crystals. Weirdly, the authors found that you can take some of that gel and use it to nucleate another protein solution, one that would otherwise form only the rhombic crystals, and form the prismatic crystals with it instead (which is a bizarre thought to me, and probably to a lot of other people who don’t crystallize things for a living). You actually see the crystals growing out of the surface of the lump of gelatinous protein gorp, as shown at right. This is order out of chaos, for sure; I’ll bet that the temperature of the solution at that interface is changing just to make the thermodynamics of all that loss of entropy work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the early stages of crystal formation like this allowed the authors to come up with all the plausible models of the nanorods and compare those to experimental data. One clearly matches better than the rest of them, so now we know what the earliest crystal formation contacts are, and can start to explain why. The preferred mode of contact buries a lot more negative charges in the protein surface, and the paper goes into detail about how this can explain the effects of sulfate ions in the solution versus PEG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it appears that the prismatic crystals (from ammonium sulfate) are made up of bunches of nanorods, rather than growing molecule-by-molecule, which is also contrary to the mental pictures that many of us have. Meanwhile, the rhombic crystals grow more like the traditional picture, monomer by monomer. The nanorod form, though, can also be trapped in a metastable fibril state, starting off as individual fibrils and going on to a gel, with too high an activation energy to dissociate and form prismatic crystals. But its surface can nucleate the formation of such crystals (as in the above photo). At really high PEG concentrations you get a different gel, which is not composed of fibrils, and seems to be a complete dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they don’t see any evidence for, though, is another mode predicted by theory (and which I mentioned in the last post on this stuff): formation of phase-separated nanodroplets that then crystallize. Those nanodroplets take us back to the hot topic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;protein condensates&lt;/a&gt; inside cells, and perhaps its a good thing that they’re not invariably precursors to forming protein crystals (!) That is very likely the reason that such condensates seem to feature intrinsically disordered proteins as well, to avoid the crystallization problem. . .&lt;/p&gt;

Arterial blood gases were measured at the end of each ventilation trial. Ventilation was provided using the same tidal volume throughout the ventilation trials. Comparison using generalized linear mixed model revealed no significant group effects with respect to aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and carotid blood flow; however, significant group effect in terms of ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).

Spatial navigation and context-dependent episodic memories are represented in several interconnected regions including the hippocampal and entorhinal cortices, but the cellular mechanisms for their dynamic coupling remain to be defined. Using monosynaptically-restricted retrograde viral tracing in mice, we identified a subcortical GABAergic input from the medial septum that terminated in the entorhinal cortex, with collaterals innervating the dorsal presubiculum.

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls. Furthermore, higher proportions of viral sequences from northern pintails (&lt;i&gt;Anas acuta&lt;/i&gt;), emperor geese and glaucous-winged gulls were grouped in phylogenetic clades that included IAV sequences originating from wild birds sampled in Asia as compared to non-pintail dabbling ducks, a difference that may be related to intercontinental migratory tendencies of host species. Our summary of research and surveillance efforts at Izembek NWR will assist in future prioritization of which hosts to sample and swab types to collect in Alaska and elsewhere in order to maximize isolate recovery, subtype and sequence diversity for resultant viruses, and detection of evidence for intercontinental viral exchange.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195327</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4610:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew B.

Performance-based financing (PBF) schemes have been expanding rapidly across low and middle income countries in the past decade, with considerable external financing from multilateral, bilateral and global health initiatives. Many of these countries have been fragile and conflict-affected (FCAS), but while the influence of context is acknowledged to be important to the operation of PBF, there has been little examination of how it affects adoption and implementation of PBF. This article lays out initial hypotheses about how FCAS contexts may influence the adoption, adaption, implementation and health system effects of PBF. These are then interrogated through a review of available grey and published literature (140 documents in total, covering 23 PBF schemes). We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522789200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195301</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f62:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Paola Bertone, Jean-Benoît Falisse, Giuliano Russo, Sophie Witter&lt;/p&gt;

Oxytocin is a neurohypophysial peptide linked to a wide range of biological functions, including milk ejection, temperament and reproduction. Aims of the present study were a) the characterization of the &lt;i&gt;OXT&lt;/i&gt; (Oxytocin-neurophysin I) gene and its regulatory regions in Old and New world camelids; b) the investigation of the genetic diversity and the discovery of markers potentially affecting the gene regulation. On average, the gene extends over 814 bp, ranging between 825 bp in dromedary, 811 bp in Bactrian and 810 bp in llama and alpaca.

Oxytocin is a neurohypophysial peptide linked to a wide range of biological functions, including milk ejection, temperament and reproduction. Aims of the present study were a) the characterization of the &lt;i&gt;OXT&lt;/i&gt; (Oxytocin-neurophysin I) gene and its regulatory regions in Old and New world camelids; b) the investigation of the genetic diversity and the discovery of markers potentially affecting the gene regulation. On average, the gene extends over 814 bp, ranging between 825 bp in dromedary, 811 bp in Bactrian and 810 bp in llama and alpaca. Such difference in size is due to a duplication event of 21 bp in dromedary.

Global introductions of aquatic species and their associated pathogens are threatening worldwide biodiversity. The introduction of two North American crayfish species, &lt;i&gt;Procambarus clarkii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pacifastacus leniusculus&lt;/i&gt;, into Japan in 1927 seems to have negatively affected native Japanese crayfish populations of &lt;i&gt;Cambaroides japonicus&lt;/i&gt;.

Identity-based proxy re-signature (IDPRS) is a novel cryptographic primitive that allows a semi-trusted proxy to convert a signature under one identity into another signature under another identity on the same message by using a re-signature key. Due to this transformation function, IDPRS is very useful in constructing privacy-preserving schemes for various information systems. Key revocation functionality is important in practical IDPRS for managing users dynamically; however, the existing IDPRS schemes do not provide revocation mechanisms that allow the removal of misbehaving or compromised users from the system. In this paper, we first introduce a notion called revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (RIDPRS) to achieve the revocation functionality. We provide a formal definition of RIDPRS as well as its security model. Then, we present a concrete RIDPRS scheme that can resist signing key exposure and prove that the proposed scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen identity and message attacks in the standard model. To further improve the performance of signature verification in RIDPRS, we introduce a notion called server-aided revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (SA-RIDPRS). Moreover, we extend the proposed RIDPRS scheme to the SA-RIDPRS scheme and prove that this extended scheme is secure against adaptive chosen message and collusion attacks. The analysis results show that our two schemes remain efficient in terms of computational complexity when implementing user revocation procedures. In particular, in the SA-RIDPRS scheme, the verifier needs to perform only a bilinear pairing and four exponentiation operations to verify the validity of the signature. Compared with other IDPRS schemes in the standard model, our SA-RIDPRS scheme greatly reduces the computation overhead of verification.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522098000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194783</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5fa:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaodong Yang, Chunlin Chen, Tingchun Ma, Jinli Wang, Caifen Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Given a selection of older papers from the journal that readers were unfamiliar with, could they pick out the ones that ended up getting cited more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this work, revised and expanded, is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194903&quot;&gt;subject of a paper&lt;/a&gt; in PLOS ONE (open access, by definition), and the author line features some blog pseudonyms, interestingly. A 2003 issue of JACS was selected, and respondents were asked the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers in the issue to you think are the most ‘significant’ (your own definition of ‘significant’ is what is important here)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without looking up numbers, which three papers do you think will have been cited the most to-date?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you most want to point out to other chemists?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you want to shout about from the rooftops (i.e., tell anybody about, not just chemists)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad to say that I seem to have skewed the set of responders a bit, since it appears that many of the people who answered the survey were readers of this blog following a link. Looking over the papers that were suggested, it seems that the correlation between the first set and the third (significant, and should be shared with other chemists) was pretty strong, as you might think, but that correlation between “significant” and “will have been cited the most” was somewhat weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the correlation between what respondents thought would be the most cited articles and the actual ten-years-later citation counts was quite poor (see the paper’s Figure 1). Looking at Figure 2, you can see that none of the other questions, in fact, correlate well with the real citation counts (I would be rather unhappy if these graphs represented project assay correlations!) Of course, it’s also true that the respondents disagreed pretty significantly about which papers were significant in the first place. That’s strong evidence that the survey set was indeed composed of practicing chemists, because we rarely agree on much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there indeed differences between “interesting, thought-provoking” papers and ones that you feel like telling other chemists about? Or between those and the ones that pick up citations? These data, though far from comprehensive, suggest that both of these may be true (as does ones own intuition, for what that’s worth). The paper tries to correlate responses to the reported areas of specialization of the responders, and there may well be something to that. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja034820y&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was cited 325 times over the next ten years, but only five responders to the survey picked it as one that would get cited. All five of them, though, indicated that they specialized in this general area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja0345423&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was selected by many survey responders as one that would pick up citations, but its actual ten-year citation count was average-to-modest. My own guess here (I may have picked this one myself!) was that the title sounded like something “hot”, by current standards, and it surely would have been picked up on. But that shows you the peril of such gut feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this does is drive yet another nail into the idea that current publication-based measures to evaluate research importance, quality, and impact are much good at all. They aren’t. The paper finishes up on just this point, referencing several other initiatives that are trying to overturn citation counts, h-indices, journal impact factors and so on. These things are measures, sure enough, but they’re not necessarily measuring very much, and not necessarily what some of their users think that they’re measuring!&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><summary><content>Back in 2013, I mentioned the “JACS Challenge”, an interesting attempt to see if papers that eventually got cited a lot were obvious prima facie.

The poorly understood mechanisms of dry season persistence of &lt;i&gt;Anopheles&lt;/i&gt; spp. mosquitoes through the dry season in Africa remain a critical gap in our knowledge of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; disease transmission. While it is thought that adult mosquitoes remain in a dormant state throughout this seven-month dry season, the nature of this state remains unknown and has largely not been recapitulated in laboratory settings. To elucidate possible connections of this state with microbial composition, the whole body microbiomes of adult mosquitoes in the dry and wet seasons in two locations of Mali with varying water availability were compared by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. These locations were a village near the Niger River with year-round water sources (N’Gabakoro, “riparian”), and a typical Sahelian area with highly seasonal breeding sites (Thierola Area, “Sahelian”). The 16S bacterial data consisted of 2057 sequence variants in 426 genera across 184 families. From these data, we found several compositional differences that were seasonally and spatially linked. Counter to our initial hypothesis, there were more pronounced seasonal differences in the bacterial microbiome of riparian, rather than Sahelian areas. These seasonal shifts were primarily in &lt;i&gt;Ralstonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sphingorhabdus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Duganella&lt;/i&gt; spp. bacteria that are usually soil and water-associated, indicating these changes may be from bacteria acquired in the larval environment, rather than adulthood. In Sahelian dry season mosquitoes, there was a unique intracellular bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Anaplasma&lt;/i&gt;, which likely was acquired through non-human blood feeding. Cytochrome B analysis of blood meals showed greater heterogeneity in host choice of &lt;i&gt;An&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coluzzii&lt;/i&gt; independent of season in the Thierola area compared to N’Gabakoro (77.5% vs. 94.6% human-origin blood meal, respectively), indicating a relaxation of anthropophily. Overall, this exploratory study provides valuable indications of spatial and seasonal differences in bacterial composition which help refine this difficult to study state.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194899</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef07:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin J.

On the contrary, the positive effect of poor health at childhood on poor health at older ages is not significantly mediated by education and life-course trajectories. Education captures most of the mediating effect of parental socio-economic status. More specifically, between 66% and 75% of the indirect effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Again, higher percentages are found for men (86% - 93%).

These arboviruses are transmitted during adult female mosquito bloodfeeding. While these viruses must transverse the midgut to replicate, the blood meal must also reach the midgut to be digested, absorbed, or excreted, as aggregation of blood meal metabolites can be toxic to the female mosquito midgut. The midgut peritrophic matrix (PM), a semipermeable extracellular layer comprised of chitin fibrils, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, is one such mechanism of protection for the mosquito midgut. However, this structure has not been characterized for adult female &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. We conducted a mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis to identify proteins that comprise or are associated with the adult female &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; early midgut PM. Altogether, 474 unique proteins were identified, with 115 predicted as secreted. GO-term enrichment analysis revealed an abundance of serine-type proteases and several known and novel intestinal mucins. In addition, approximately 10% of the peptides identified corresponded to known salivary proteins, indicating &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes extensively swallow their own salivary secretions. However, the physiological relevance of this remains unclear, and further studies are needed to determine PM proteins integral for midgut protection from blood meal derived toxicity and pathogen protection. Finally, we describe substantial discordance between previously described transcriptionally changes observed in the midgut in response to a bloodmeal and the presence of the corresponding protein in the PM.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The clinical significance of the laboratory-based phenomenon of clopidogrel hypo-responsiveness and platelet reactivity associated with acute myocardial infarction, despite chronic clopidogrel therapy, is largely unknown. We aimed to determine platelet reactivity and clinical and angiographic features in 29 consecutive patients sustaining an acute myocardial infarction despite chronic (≥1 month) clopidogrel therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Platelet reactivity was determined on admission using conventional aggregometry. All patients underwent coronary angiography within 24 hours of admission. Patients were matched with clopidogrel-naïve acute myocardial infarction patients. Clopidogrel-naïve patients received a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose and 75 mg/day thereafter.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 29 study patients, 19 (66%) presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and in 25% the infarction was related to angiographically-proved definite stent thrombosis. Two-thirds of these patients were poor responders to clopidogrel (adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation &gt;50%) and dual antiplatelet poor responsiveness was found in 57% in the chronic clopidogrel therapy group.

Background &lt;p&gt;Since 1946 the controlled human infection model (CHIM) for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; has been used to improve understanding of disease pathogenesis, describe clinical and immunologic responses to infection and as a tool for vaccine development. As the frequency and intent for use in vaccine comparisons increases, standardization of the primary endpoint definition is necessary.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subject-level data were obtained from previously conducted experimental &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM studies. Signs and symptoms severity were categorized consistently across all studies. Sign and symptom correlations were estimated and univariate models were utilized to describe the association between stool output and other &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt;-attributable signs and symptoms. Multiple correspondence and hierarchical clustering analyses were performed to describe the co-occurrence of signs and symptoms. A disease score is proposed based on the co-occurrence of these events.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data were obtained on 54 subjects receiving 800 to 2000 colony forming units (cfu) of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt;. The median maximum 24 hour stool output was 514 ml (IQR: 300, 998 ml) with a median frequency of 6 (IQR: 4, 9). Subjects reported abdominal pain or cramps (81.5%), headache (66.7%) and anorexia (64.8%), 50.0% had a fever and 27.8% had gross blood in multiple loose stools. Multiple correspondence analyses highlighted co-occurrence of symptoms based on severity. A 3-parameter disease severity score predicted shigellosis endpoints and better differentiated disease spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Dichotomous endpoints for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM fail to fully account for disease variability. An ordinal disease score characterizing the breadth of disease severity may enable a better characterization of shigellosis and can decrease sample size requirements. Furthermore, the disease severity score may be a useful tool for portfolio management by enabling prioritization across vaccine candidates with comparable efficacy estimates using dichotomous endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194325</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad281a:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chad K.

Multiple correspondence analyses highlighted co-occurrence of symptoms based on severity. A 3-parameter disease severity score predicted shigellosis endpoints and better differentiated disease spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Dichotomous endpoints for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM fail to fully account for disease variability. An ordinal disease score characterizing the breadth of disease severity may enable a better characterization of shigellosis and can decrease sample size requirements. Furthermore, the disease severity score may be a useful tool for portfolio management by enabling prioritization across vaccine candidates with comparable efficacy estimates using dichotomous endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194325</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>a31a6303</fingerprint><crawled>1522259109027</crawled></item><item><published>1522738800000</published><title>Experimentally quantifying anion polarizability at the air/water interface</title><author><name>Yujin Tong</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/NlhoP4yU9Nw/s41467-018-03598-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experimentally quantifying anion polarizability at the air/water interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimentally quantifying anion polarizability at the air/water interface, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03598-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03598-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Understanding anion-specific interactions with hydrophobic interfaces is challenging due to an absence of local structural probes.

Urinary type IV collagen (U-Col4) and albumin excretion is evaluated to monitor the development of diabetic kidney disease. However, U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, 1067 participants without diabetes and with urinary albumin-creatinine ratio &amp;lt;300 mg/gCr (normo- or microalbuminuria) who underwent an annual health examination in 2004 were enrolled and observed for 5 years. They were divided according to the amount of U-Col4 or urinary albumin excreted. The decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated. In participants with eGFR ≥80 mL/min, abnormal U-Col4 excretion was indicated as a significant independent risk factor for 10% eGFR change per year, which is one of the prognostic factors for the development of end-stage kidney disease. Moreover, in contrast to urinary albumin excretion, U-Col4 excretion was not related to age or kidney function, suggesting that some individuals with abnormal U-Col4 excretion can have an independent hidden risk for the development of kidney dysfunction. In conclusion, it is important to measure U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes to determine changes in renal features in every individual and help detect future complications such as diabetic kidney disease. If U-Col4 excretion is abnormal, kidney manifestation should be carefully followed up, even if the kidney function and urinalysis findings are normal.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523048400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195523</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd081:7c9981b6</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fumi Kishi, Kojiro Nagai, Norimichi Takamatsu, Tatsuya Tominaga, Masanori Tamaki, Eriko Shibata, Taichi Murakami, Seiji Kishi, Hideharu Abe, Yasuhiko Koezuka, Naoto Minagawa, Go Ichien, Toshio Doi&lt;/p&gt;

The ecology of Lyme borreliosis is complex in northwestern California, with several potential reservoir hosts, tick vectors, and genospecies of &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato. The primary objective of this study was to determine the fine-scale spatial distribution of different genospecies in four rodent species, the California ground squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Otospermophilus beecheyi&lt;/i&gt;), northern flying squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Glaucomys sabrinus&lt;/i&gt;), dusky-footed woodrat (&lt;i&gt;Neotoma fuscipes&lt;/i&gt;), and Allen’s chipmunk (&lt;i&gt;Neotamias senex&lt;/i&gt;). Rodents were live-trapped between June 2004 and May 2005 at the Hoopa Valley Tribal Reservation (HVTR) in Humboldt County, California. Ear-punch biopsies obtained from each rodent were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis. The programs ArcGIS and SaTScan were used to examine the spatial distribution of genospecies. Multinomial log-linear models were used to model habitat and host-specific characteristics and their effect on the presence of each borrelial genospecies. The Akaike information criterion (AICc) was used to compare models and determine model fit. &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was primarily associated with chipmunks and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; largely with woodrats.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The transcription factor SOX2 has been identified as a lineage survival oncogene in squamous cell carcinoma and copy number gain is a common event in several human malignancies including head and neck cancer. However, the regulation and function of SOX2 during carcinogenesis as well as its prognostic value appears to be highly context dependent. As an example, high SOX2 expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is related to a favorable prognosis, while it is associated with poor outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. More recently, higher SOX2 levels and improved survival was also reported for head and neck SCC (HNSCC), and silencing of SOX2 expression in HNSCC cell lines revealed a mesenchymal-like phenotype with prominent vimentin expression. So far, SOX2 expression and its clinical relevance for other head and neck cancers, such as adenoid cystic carcinoma (HNACC) have not been sufficiently investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;SOX2, vimentin and E-cadherin expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining on serial sections from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples of a patient cohort (n = 45) with primary ACC and correlated with patient and tumor characteristics as well as survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;High SOX2 expression was found in 14 (31%) primary tumor specimens and was significantly correlated with a N0 lymph node status (p = 0.04), while low SOX2 expression was correlated with a solid growth pattern (p = 0.031). Of the 45 patients, 27 tumor samples resembled an EMT-like phenotype, as assessed by high vimentin and low E-cadherin levels. However, in HNACC SOX2 levels were neither correlated with vimentin nor with E-cadherin expression, further supporting a context dependent regulation and function of SOX2 in distinct tumor entities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The absence of SOX2 was predominantly found in solid HNACC, which are characterized by a more aggressive phenotype in ACC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of SOX2 regulation and function in distinct HNACC subgroups remain to be fully elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194989</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef15:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julia Thierauf, Stephanie E.

However, the regulation and function of SOX2 during carcinogenesis as well as its prognostic value appears to be highly context dependent. As an example, high SOX2 expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is related to a favorable prognosis, while it is associated with poor outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. More recently, higher SOX2 levels and improved survival was also reported for head and neck SCC (HNSCC), and silencing of SOX2 expression in HNSCC cell lines revealed a mesenchymal-like phenotype with prominent vimentin expression. So far, SOX2 expression and its clinical relevance for other head and neck cancers, such as adenoid cystic carcinoma (HNACC) have not been sufficiently investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;SOX2, vimentin and E-cadherin expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining on serial sections from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples of a patient cohort (n = 45) with primary ACC and correlated with patient and tumor characteristics as well as survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;High SOX2 expression was found in 14 (31%) primary tumor specimens and was significantly correlated with a N0 lymph node status (p = 0.04), while low SOX2 expression was correlated with a solid growth pattern (p = 0.031). Of the 45 patients, 27 tumor samples resembled an EMT-like phenotype, as assessed by high vimentin and low E-cadherin levels. However, in HNACC SOX2 levels were neither correlated with vimentin nor with E-cadherin expression, further supporting a context dependent regulation and function of SOX2 in distinct tumor entities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The absence of SOX2 was predominantly found in solid HNACC, which are characterized by a more aggressive phenotype in ACC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of SOX2 regulation and function in distinct HNACC subgroups remain to be fully elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194989</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>5b71cedc</fingerprint><crawled>1522345504828</crawled></item><item><published>1524024000000</published><title>[ASAP] Hydration Structure and Dynamics of Inhibitor-Bound HIV-1 Protease</title><author><name>Florian Leidner, Nese Kurt Yilmaz, Janet Paulsen, Yves A.

Biofilms are microbial collectives that occupy a diverse array of surfaces. It is well known that the function and evolution of biofilms are strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of different strains and species within them, but how spatiotemporal distributions of different genotypes in biofilm populations originate is still underexplored. Here, we study the origins of biofilm genetic structure by combining model development, numerical simulations, and microfluidic experiments using the human pathogen &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt;. Using spatial correlation functions to quantify the differences between emergent cell lineage segregation patterns, we find that strong adhesion often, but not always, maximizes the size of clonal cell clusters on flat surfaces. Counterintuitively, our model predicts that, under some conditions, investing in adhesion can reduce rather than increase clonal group size. Our results emphasize that a complex interaction between fluid flow and cell adhesiveness can underlie emergent patterns of biofilm genetic structure. This structure, in turn, has an outsize influence on how biofilm-dwelling populations function and evolve.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-LcIezdmCHM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006094</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006094</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1523911321731</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d1:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ricardo Martínez-García, Carey D.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Paraquat poisoning can result in dysfunction of multiple organs, and pulmonary fibrosis with respiratory failure is the major cause of mortality. For terminally ill patients, some life-prolonging treatments can be non-beneficial treatments (NBT). The objective of this study was to determine if intubation is a NBT for patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study included 68 patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning. Patients were hospitalized at MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taitung Branch, Taiwan, between 2005 to April 2016. Composite outcomes of intra-hospital mortality, the rate of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, prescribed medications, length of stay, and medical costs were recorded and compared between the do-not-intubate (DNI) group and endotracheal intubation (EI) group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Intra-hospital mortality rate for the entire population was 100%. There were significantly more patients with DNR orders in the DNI group (P = 0.007). There were no differences in the length of hospital stay. However, patients in DNI group had significantly less vasopressor use and more morphine use, shorter time in the intensive care unit, and fewer medical costs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The procedure of intubation in patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning can be considered inappropriate life-prolonging treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195071</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4258:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Meng-Ruey Wu, Chia-Ying Hsiao, Chun-Han Cheng, Feng-Ching Liao, Chuan-Lei Chao, Chun-Yen Chen, Hung-I Yeh, Min-I Su&lt;/p&gt;

However, patients in DNI group had significantly less vasopressor use and more morphine use, shorter time in the intensive care unit, and fewer medical costs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The procedure of intubation in patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning can be considered inappropriate life-prolonging treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195071</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>52e34a5f</fingerprint><crawled>1522259838149</crawled></item><item><published>1523554636000</published><title>Wildflower contamination with neonicotinoids</title><author><name>Fahrenkamp-Uppenbrink, J.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-c?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/167.3.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-c?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fececa:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-c?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>ba8b6fa4</fingerprint><crawled>1523556775856</crawled></item><item><published>1522259407000</published><title>[Editors&apos;

Succulent cacti (Cactaceae) are among the most threatened taxonomic groups assessed to date. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity and population structure of a narrow endemic columnar cactus &lt;i&gt;Pilosocereus aureispinus&lt;/i&gt;. This species is only found in a small area of c. 300 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of rocky savanna from eastern Brazil and it is currently classified as vulnerable (VU) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Eight microsatellite loci were genotyped for 91 individuals from four localities of the known &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt; range. In contrast with expectations for narrow endemic species, we found relatively high levels of genetic diversity (e.g., &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.390 to 0.525; &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.394 to 0.572) and very low population structure based on the variation of six loci. All the analyzed individuals were clustered in one unique genetic group in assignment tests. We also generated the sequences of two plastid markers (&lt;i&gt;trnT-trnL&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;psbD-trnT&lt;/i&gt;) and found no variation on a subsample of 39 individuals. We used Landsat 8 images and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to estimate a potential extent of occurrence of c. 750 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for this species. Our results showed that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt; is not suffering from erosion of nuclear genetic variability due to its narrow distribution. However, we advocate that because of the extremely limited extent of occurrence, the ongoing anthropogenic disturbances in its habitat, and phylogenetic distinctiveness of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt;, this species should be classified as endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523307600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195475</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171528f:9aea0a7d</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gulzar Khan, Paulianny M.

We sought to identify biomarkers which delineated individual hypertrophic responses to resistance training. Untrained, college-aged males engaged in full-body resistance training (3 d/wk) for 12 weeks. Body composition via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL) thickness via ultrasound, blood, VL muscle biopsies, and three-repetition maximum (3-RM) squat strength were obtained prior to (PRE) and following (POST) 12 weeks of training. K-means cluster analysis based on VL thickness changes identified LOW [n = 17; change (mean±SD) = +0.11±0.14 cm], modest (MOD; n = 29, +0.40±0.06 cm), and high (HI; n = 21, +0.69±0.14 cm) responders. Biomarkers related to histology, ribosome biogenesis, proteolysis, inflammation, and androgen signaling were analyzed between clusters. There were main effects of time (POST&gt;PRE, p&amp;lt;0.05) but no cluster×time interactions for increases in DXA lean body mass, type I and II muscle fiber cross sectional area and myonuclear number, satellite cell number, and macronutrients consumed. Interestingly, PRE VL thickness was ~12% greater in LOW versus HI (p = 0.021), despite POST values being ~12% greater in HI versus LOW (p = 0.006). However there was only a weak correlation between PRE VL thickness scores and change in VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.114, p = 0.005). Forced post hoc analysis indicated that muscle total RNA levels (i.e., ribosome density) did not significantly increase in the LOW cluster (351±70 ng/mg to 380±62, p = 0.253), but increased in the MOD (369±115 to 429±92, p = 0.009) and HI clusters (356±77 to 470±134, p&amp;lt;0.001; POST HI&gt;POST LOW, p = 0.013). Nonetheless, there was only a weak association between change in muscle total RNA and VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.079, p = 0.026). IL-1β mRNA levels decreased in the MOD and HI clusters following training (p&amp;lt;0.05), although associations between this marker and VL thickness changes were not significant (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0002, p = 0.919). In conclusion, individuals with lower pre-training VL thickness values and greater increases muscle total RNA levels following 12 weeks of resistance training experienced greater VL muscle growth, although these biomarkers individually explained only ~8–11% of the variance in hypertrophy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195203</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4603:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher B.

In conclusion, individuals with lower pre-training VL thickness values and greater increases muscle total RNA levels following 12 weeks of resistance training experienced greater VL muscle growth, although these biomarkers individually explained only ~8–11% of the variance in hypertrophy.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195203</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>f801a9ee</fingerprint><crawled>1522950125206</crawled></item><item><published>1524034800000</published><title>Author Correction: US Power Production at Risk from Water Stress in a Changing Climate</title><author><name>Poulomi Ganguli</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/8mUKMm8ZRos/s41598-018-24600-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: US Power Production at Risk from Water Stress in a Changing Climate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: US Power Production at Risk from Water Stress in a Changing Climate, Published online: 18 April 2018;

Dual MDMX/MDM2 inhibition by ALRN-6924 inhibits cellular proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cell lines and primary AML patient cells, including leukemic stem cell–enriched populations, and disrupts functional clonogenic and serial replating capacity. Furthermore, ALRN-6924 markedly improves survival in AML xenograft models.

Vibrations are important cues for tactile perception across species. Whisker-based sensation in mice is a powerful model system for investigating mechanisms of tactile perception. However, the role vibration plays in whisker-based sensation remains unsettled, in part due to difficulties in modeling the vibration of whiskers. Here, we develop an analytical approach to calculate the vibrations of whiskers striking objects. We use this approach to quantify vibration forces during active whisker touch at a range of locations along the whisker. The frequency and amplitude of vibrations evoked by contact are strongly dependent on the position of contact along the whisker. The magnitude of vibrational shear force and bending moment is comparable to quasi-static forces. The fundamental vibration frequencies are in a detectable range for mechanoreceptor properties and below the maximum spike rates of primary sensory afferents. These results suggest two dynamic cues exist that rodents can use for object localization: vibration frequency and comparison of vibrational to quasi-static force magnitude. These complement the use of quasi-static force angle as a distance cue, particularly for touches close to the follicle, where whiskers are stiff and force angles hardly change during touch. Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oRjfKRlw_io&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522184400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006032</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006032</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1522182248935</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162688e2a3c:4d823:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Vaxenburg, Isis Wyche, Karel Svoboda, Alexander L.

We propose that cases where a single genotype can manifest as multiple phenotypes may be more common than previously expected and offer a general mechanism for evolutionary innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1542?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>9fab9e57</fingerprint><crawled>1522347550579</crawled></item><item><published>1524085200000</published><title>Correction: Molecular adaptation in Rubisco: Discriminating between convergent evolution and positive selection using mechanistic and classical codon models</title><author><name>Sahar Parto</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196267</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196267</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sahar Parto, Nicolas Lartillot&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196267</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccc6:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sahar Parto, Nicolas Lartillot&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196267</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>5115c81e</fingerprint><crawled>1524073508287</crawled></item><item><published>1523990209000</published><title>Economics- and policy-driven organic carbon input enhancement dominates soil organic carbon accumulation in Chinese croplands [Biological Sciences]</title><author><name>Yongcun Zhao, Meiyan Wang, Shuijin Hu, Xudong Zhang, Zhu Ouyang, Ganlin Zhang, Biao Huang, Shiwei Zhao, Jinshui Wu, Deti Xie, Bo Zhu, Dongsheng Yu, Xianzhang Pan, Shengxiang Xu, Xuezheng Shi</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4045</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4045.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Climate Change, Policy, and Carbon Sequestration in China Special Feature</item></keywords><content><content>China’s croplands have experienced drastic changes in management practices, such as fertilization, tillage, and residue treatments, since the 1980s.

Cerium (Ce) belongs to the rare earth elements (REEs), and although it is not essential for plants, it can stimulate growth and other physiological processes. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of Ce on seed germination, initial seedling growth, and vegetative growth in rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) cv. Morelos A-98. During the germination process, the seeds were treated with Ce concentrations of 0, 4, 8, and 12 μM; after 5 d, germination percentage was recorded and after 10 d seedling growth was measured. For vegetative growth, a hydroponic system was established where 14-d-old plants without previous Ce treatment were transferred into nutrient solution. After two weeks of acclimatizing, 0, 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce were added to the nutrient solution for 28 d. Ce significantly increased germination and the initial growth variables of the seedlings. During vegetative growth, Ce increased plant height, number of tillers, root volume, and shoot fresh and dry biomass, without affecting root biomass weight. With low Ce concentrations (25 and 50 μM), the concentrations of chlorophylls and amino acids in the shoots were similar to those in the control, like amino acid concentration in the roots at a concentration of 25 μM Ce. Conversely, the concentration of total sugars increased in the shoot with the application of 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce, and in the roots with the application of 50 μM Ce. Also, Ce did not affect the concentration of macro or micronutrients in the shoots. However, in the roots, the high Ce concentration decreased the concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mn, and Zn, while the Mg concentration increased. Our results indicate that Ce, at the right concentrations, can function as a biostimulant in rice germination and growth.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522098000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194691</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f1:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Monzerrat Ramírez-Olvera, Libia Iris Trejo-Téllez, Soledad García-Morales, Juan Antonio Pérez-Sato, Fernando Carlos Gómez-Merino&lt;/p&gt;

We present a computational model of spatial navigation comprising different learning mechanisms in mammals, i.e., associative, cognitive mapping and parallel systems. This model is able to reproduce a large number of experimental results in different variants of the Morris water maze task, including standard associative phenomena (spatial generalization gradient and blocking), as well as navigation based on cognitive mapping. Furthermore, we show that competitive and cooperative patterns between different navigation strategies in the model allow to explain previous apparently contradictory results supporting either associative or cognitive mechanisms for spatial learning. The key computational mechanism to reconcile experimental results showing different influences of distal and proximal cues on the behavior, different learning times, and different abilities of individuals to alternatively perform spatial and response strategies, relies in the dynamic coordination of navigation strategies, whose performance is evaluated online with a common currency through a modular approach. We provide a set of concrete experimental predictions to further test the computational model. Overall, this computational work sheds new light on inter-individual differences in navigation learning, and provides a formal and mechanistic approach to test various theories of spatial cognition in mammals.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErL2lgBM7O0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523307600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006092</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006092</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1523306525319</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162ab8d3c72:d9a78:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laurent Dollé, Ricardo Chavarriaga, Agnès Guillot, Mehdi Khamassi&lt;/p&gt;

The forces driving the accumulation and removal of non-coding DNA and ultimately the evolution of genome size in complex organisms are intimately linked to genome structure and organisation. Our analysis provides a novel method for capturing the regional variation of lineage-specific DNA gain and loss events in their respective genomic contexts. To further understand this connection we used comparative genomics to identify genome-wide individual DNA gain and loss events in the human and mouse genomes. Focusing on the distribution of DNA gains and losses, relationships to important structural features and potential impact on biological processes, we found that in autosomes, DNA gains and losses both followed separate lineage-specific accumulation patterns. However, in both species chromosome X was particularly enriched for DNA gain, consistent with its high L1 retrotransposon content required for X inactivation. We found that DNA loss was associated with gene-rich open chromatin regions and DNA gain events with gene-poor closed chromatin regions. Additionally, we found that DNA loss events tended to be smaller than DNA gain events suggesting that they were able to accumulate in gene-rich open chromatin regions due to their reduced capacity to interrupt gene regulatory architecture. GO term enrichment showed that mouse loss hotspots were strongly enriched for terms related to developmental processes. However, these genes were also located in regions with a high density of conserved elements, suggesting that despite high levels of DNA loss, gene regulatory architecture remained conserved. This is consistent with a model in which DNA gain and loss results in turnover or “churning” in regulatory element dense regions of open chromatin, where interruption of regulatory elements is selected against.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H1rMm4y09CQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006091</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006091</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagementRate>4.5</engagementRate><recrawled>1524246129185</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162e4229578:4d4f95:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Reuben M.

Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis (FFEA) is a software package designed to perform continuum mechanics simulations of proteins and other globular macromolecules. It combines conventional finite element methods with stochastic thermal noise, and is appropriate for simulations of large proteins and protein complexes at the mesoscale (length-scales in the range of 5 nm to 1 μm), where there is currently a paucity of modelling tools.

In this article we introduce our open source software package for performing FFEA simulations which we have released under a GPLv3 license.

Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis (FFEA) is a software package designed to perform continuum mechanics simulations of proteins and other globular macromolecules. It combines conventional finite element methods with stochastic thermal noise, and is appropriate for simulations of large proteins and protein complexes at the mesoscale (length-scales in the range of 5 nm to 1 μm), where there is currently a paucity of modelling tools. It requires 3D volumetric information as input, which can be low resolution structural information such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps or much higher resolution atomistic co-ordinates from which volumetric information can be extracted.

While there is substantial evidence that adults who violate gender stereotypes often face backlash (i.e. social and economic penalties), less is known about the nature of gender stereotypes for young children, and the penalties that children may face for violating them. We conducted three experiments, with over 2000 adults from the US, to better understand the content and consequences of adults’ gender stereotypes for young children. In Experiment 1, we tested which characteristics adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 635) believed to be descriptive (i.e. typical), prescriptive (i.e. required), and proscriptive (i.e. forbidden) for preschool-aged boys and girls. Using the characteristics that were rated in Experiment 1, we then constructed vignettes that were either ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’, and manipulated whether the vignettes were said to describe a boy or a girl. Experiment 2 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 697) revealed that adults rated stereotype-violating children as less likeable than their stereotype-conforming peers, and that this difference was more robust for boys than girls. Experiment 3 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 731) was a direct replication of Experiment 2, and revealed converging evidence of backlash against stereotype-violating children. In sum, our results suggest that even young children encounter backlash from adults for stereotype violations, and that these effects may be strongest for boys.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523307600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195503</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715290:9aea0a7d</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica Sullivan, Corinne Moss-Racusin, Michael Lopez, Katherine Williams&lt;/p&gt;

Increased production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their widespread application in industrial and consumer products have led to a rise in the release of CNTs into the aquatic environment. CNTs have a very strong adsorption affinity for various environmental contaminants; therefore, they may also influence the toxic effects of other pollutants, such as toxic metals. In this study, the effect of two different functionalized carbon nanotubes, carboxylate and polyethyleneimine modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (C-MWCNTs and N-MWCNT, respectively) on lead toxicity and bioaccumulation was investigated with a freshwater zooplankton &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt;. The acute toxicity results indicate that the different surface properties of the two types of MWCNTs have different effects on lead toxicity to &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;magna&lt;/i&gt;. The negatively charged C-MWCNT showed a notable decrease in lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.08 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; C-MWCNT), whereas the positively charged N-MWCNT had only a slight effect on lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 0.16 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; N-MWCNT). The decrease of lead toxicity was related with the reduced bioavailability of free metal form (Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) caused by greater adsorption of lead onto the MWCNTs. The present study suggests that there is a need to consider carefully the complex interaction of CNTs with toxic metals in future ecotoxicological studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194935</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0c:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Min-Hee Jang, Yu Sik Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

Network analysis of large metagenomic datasets generated by current sequencing technologies can reveal significant co-occurrence patterns between microbial species of a biological community. These patterns can be analyzed in terms of pairwise combinations between all species comprising a community. Here, we construct a co-occurrence network for abundant microbial species encompassing the three dominant phyla found in human gut. This was followed by an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; evaluation of the predicted microbe-microbe co-occurrences, where we chose species pairs &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium adolescentis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Roseburia inulinivorans&lt;/i&gt; as model organisms for our study. We then delineate the outcome of the co-cultures when equal distributions of resources were provided. The growth behavior of the co-culture was found to be dependent on the types of microbial species present, their specific metabolic activities, and resulting changes in the culture environment. Through this reductionist approach and using novel &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; combinations of microbial species under anaerobic conditions, the results of this work will aid in the understanding and design of synthetic community formulations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522443600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195161</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c53:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Promi Das, Boyang Ji, Petia Kovatcheva-Datchary, Fredrik Bäckhed, Jens Nielsen&lt;/p&gt;

It is now well accepted that radiation induced bystander effects can occur in cells exposed to media from irradiated cells. The aim of this study was to follow the bystander cells in real time following addition of media from irradiated cells and to determine the effect of inhibiting these signals. A human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT cells, was irradiated (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy) with γ irradiation, conditioned medium was harvested after one hour and added to recipient bystander cells. Reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, Glutathione levels, caspase activation, cytotoxicity and cell viability was measured after the addition of irradiated cell conditioned media to bystander cells. Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide levels in bystander cells treated with 0.5Gy ICCM were analysed in real time using time lapse fluorescence microscopy. The levels of reactive oxygen species were also measured in real time after the addition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase pathway inhibitors. ROS and glutathione levels were observed to increase after the addition of irradiated cell conditioned media (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM). Caspase activation was found to increase 4 hours after irradiated cell conditioned media treatment (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM) and this increase was observed up to 8 hours and there after a reduction in caspase activation was observed. A decrease in cell viability was observed but no major change in cytotoxicity was found in HaCaT cells after treatment with irradiated cell conditioned media (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM). This study involved the identification of key signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, glutathione and caspases generated in bystander cells. These results suggest a clear connection between reactive oxygen species and cell survival pathways with persistent production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in bystander cells following exposure to irradiated cell conditioned media.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195371</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4619:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kishore Kumar Jella, Roisin Moriarty, Brendan McClean, Hugh J.

Modulating immune responses to sepsis and trauma remain one of the most difficult challenges in modern medicine. Large burn injuries (LBI) are a severe form of trauma associated with sepsis, immune impairment, and mortality. Immune dysfunction after LBI is complex, involving both enhanced and impaired immune activation. The release of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), such as HMGB1, and cytokines (e.g. IL-1β) creates an environment of immune dysfunction often leading to end organ failure and death. Both HMGB1 and IL-1β have been found to play critical roles in sepsis and post-burn immune dysfunction. HMGB1 and IL-1β have been shown previously to form potent complexes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We recently identified the presence of HMGB1/IL-1β heterocomplexes in human tissue. We now find HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in human and mouse plasma, and identify a synergistic role of HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in post-burn immune dysfunction. In both humans and mice, we found that HMGB1 was enriched in plasma microvesicles (MVs) after LBI. HMGB1 was found form complexes with IL-1β. Using flow cytometry of mouse plasma MVs, we identified an increase in an HMGB1+/IL-1β+ MVs. Using co-IP, HMGB1 was found to bind the pro-form of IL-1β in mouse and human plasma. Pro-IL-1β, which is traditionally considered inactive, became active when complexed with HMGB1. Human THP-1 monocytes treated with HMGB1-pro-IL-1β complexes showed increased transcription of LBI associated cytokines IL-6 and IFNβ along with suppression of iNOS, mimicking findings associated with LBI. These findings identify that HMGB1/IL-1β complexes released after burn injuries can modulate immune responses, and microvesicles are identified as a novel reservoir for these immune mediators. These complexes might serve as novel immune targets for the treatment of systemic immune responses due to LBI or other causes of sepsis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522443600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195335</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c5b:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leon G.

To examine effects of scan duration on estimates of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS), we reanalyzed data from thirty-nine previously reported L-[1-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]leucine PET studies. Subjects consisted of 12 healthy volunteers studied twice, awake and under propofol sedation, and 15 subjects with fragile X syndrome (FXS) studied once under propofol sedation. All scans were acquired on a high resolution scanner. We used a basis function method for voxelwise estimation of parameters of the kinetic model of L-[1-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]leucine and rCPS over the interval beginning at the time of tracer injection and ending 30, 45, 60, 75 or 90 min later. For each study and scan interval, regional estimates in nine regions and whole brain were obtained by averaging voxelwise estimates over all voxels in the region. In all three groups rCPS was only slightly affected by scan interval length and was very stable between 60 and 90 min. Furthermore, statistical comparisons of rCPS between awake and sedated healthy volunteers provided almost identical results when they were based on 60 min scan data as when they were based on data from the full 90 min interval. Statistical comparisons between sedated healthy volunteers and sedated subjects with FXS also yielded almost identical results when based on 60 and 90 min scan intervals. We conclude that, under the conditions of our studies, scan duration can be shortened to 60 min without loss of precision.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195580</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ad9:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Giampaolo Tomasi, Mattia Veronese, Alessandra Bertoldo, Carolyn Beebe Smith, Kathleen C.

Genetic variability in insect vectors is valuable to study vector competence determinants and to select non-vector populations that may help reduce the spread of vector-borne pathogens. We collected and tested vector competency of 15 isofemale lines of Asian citrus psyllid, &lt;i&gt;Diaphorina citri&lt;/i&gt;, vector of ‘&lt;i&gt;Candidatus&lt;/i&gt; Liberibacter asiaticus’ (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las is associated with huanglongbing (citrus greening), the most serious citrus disease worldwide. &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults were collected from orange jasmine (&lt;i&gt;Murraya paniculata&lt;/i&gt;) hedges in Florida, and individual pairs (females and males) were caged on healthy &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants for egg laying. The progeny from each pair that tested &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-negative by qPCR were maintained on &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants and considered an isofemale line. Six acquisition tests on &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults that were reared as nymphs on &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-infected citrus, from various generations of each line, were conducted to assess their acquisition rates (percentage of qPCR-positive adults). Three lines with mean acquisition rates of 28 to 32%, were classified as ‘good’ acquirers and three other lines were classified as ‘poor’ acquirers, with only 5 to 8% acquisition rates. All lines were further tested for their ability to inoculate &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by confining &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-exposed psyllids for one week onto healthy citrus leaves (6–10 adults/leaf/week), and testing the leaves for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by qPCR. Mean inoculation rates were 19 to 28% for the three good acquirer lines and 0 to 3% for the three poor acquirer lines. Statistical analyses indicated positive correlations between &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las acquisition and inoculation rates, as well as between &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las titer in the psyllids and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las acquisition or inoculation rates. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of one of the good and one of the poor acquirer lines revealed differences between them in color morphs and hemocyanin expression, but not the composition of bacterial endosymbionts.

A dominant mechanism in the Judgment and Decision Making literature states that information is accumulated about each choice option until a decision threshold is met. Only after that threshold does a subject start to execute a motor response to indicate their choice. However, recent research has revealed spatial gradients in motor responses as a function of comparison difficulty as well as changes-of-mind in the middle of an action, both suggesting continued accumulation and processing of decision-related signals after the decision boundary. Here we present a formal model and supporting data from a number comparison task that a continuous motor planner, combined with a simple statistical inference scheme, can model detailed behavioral effects without assuming a threshold. This threshold-free model reproduces subjects’ sensitivity to numerical distance in reaching, accuracy, reaction time, and changes of mind. We argue that the motor system positions the effectors using an optimal biomechanical feedback controller, and continuous statistical inference on outputs from cognitive processes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195188</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4600:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Santiago Alonso-Diaz, Jessica F.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We aimed to describe ethnic variations in infant mortality and explore the contribution of area deprivation, mother’s country of birth, and prematurity to these variations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed routine birth and death data on singleton live births (gestational age≥22 weeks) in England and Wales, 2006–2012. Infant mortality by ethnic group was analyzed using logistic regression with adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics and gestational age.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the 4,634,932 births analyzed, crude infant mortality rates were higher in Pakistani, Black Caribbean, Black African, and Bangladeshi infants (6.92, 6.00, 5.17 and 4.40 per 1,000 live births, respectively vs. 2.87 in White British infants). Adjustment for maternal sociodemographic characteristics changed the results little. Further adjustment for gestational age strongly attenuated the risk in Black Caribbean (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89–1.17) and Black African infants (1.17, 1.06–1.29) but not in Pakistani (2.32, 2.15–2.50), Bangladeshi (1.47, 1.28–1.69), and Indian infants (1.24, 1.11–1.38). Ethnic variations in infant mortality differed significantly between term and preterm infants. At term, South Asian groups had higher risks which cannot be explained by sociodemographic characteristics. In preterm infants, adjustment for degree of prematurity (&amp;lt;28, 28–31, 32–33, 34–36 weeks) fully explained increased risks in Black but not Pakistani and Bangladeshi infants. Sensitivity analyses with further adjustment for small for gestational age, or excluding deaths due to congenital anomalies did not fully explain the excess risk in South Asian groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Higher infant mortality in South Asian and Black infants does not appear to be explained by sociodemographic characteristics. Higher proportions of very premature infants appear to explain increased risks in Black infants but not in South Asian groups. Strategies targeting the prevention and management of preterm birth in Black groups and suboptimal birthweight and modifiable risk factors for congenital anomalies in South Asian groups might help reduce ethnic inequalities in infant mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195146</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7139:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yangmei Li, Maria A.

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522789200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006033</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006033</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1522787045837</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1628c98f9e7:4903d:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Javier A.

Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0&quot;

Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment, but limited studies focused on the association of socioeconomic status (SES) with hearing loss among adults of working age. This paper aimed to fill this gap among Chinese adults. We obtained data from Ear and Hearing Disorder Survey conducted in four provinces of China in 2014–2015. The survey was based on WHO Ear and Hearing Disorders Survey Protocol and 25,860 adults aged 25 to 59 years were selected in this study. Trained local examiners performed pure tone audiometry to screen people with hearing loss, and those who were screened positively for hearing loss were referred to audiologists to make final diagnosis. SES was measured by occupation, education and income. Results show after adjusting for SES measures and covariates, in urban areas, compared with white-collar workers, blue-collar workers and the unemployed were more likely to have hearing loss, with an odds ratio of 1.2 (95%CI: 1.0, 1.3) and 1.2 (95%CI: 1.0, 1.4), respectively. Compared with people with education of senior high school or above, those with junior high school, primary school and illiteracy had 1.6 (95%CI: 1.4, 1.8), 2.1(95%CI: 1.7, 2.5) and 2.6 (95%CI: 1.9, 3.7) times as likely to have hearing loss, respectively. In rural areas, the unemployed had 1.5 (95%CI: 1.0, 2.3) times the risk of hearing loss compared with white-collar workers, and illiterates had 1.6 (95%CI: 1.6, 2.1) times the risk of hearing loss compared with people with education of senior high school or above, after SES variables and covariates were taken into considerations. Income was not significantly associated with hearing loss in urban and rural areas. In conclusion, SES, in the form of occupation and education, was associated with hearing loss among working-aged population, and further studies are needed to explore the mechanism of such association.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195227</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde2c:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ping He, Yanan Luo, Xiangyang Hu, Rui Gong, Xu Wen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

We previously introduced an approach for EVD prognosis prediction, using models that can be implemented in the field and updated in light of new data. Here we enhance and validate our methods with the largest published EVD dataset to date. We also present a proof-of-concept medical app that summarizes patient information and offers tailored treatment options using an interactive risk visualization for quick interpretation and decision-making. Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district. We corroborated earlier reports on the importance of viral load and age as mortality predictors and identified jaundice and bleeding to be features with highest predictive value at presentation. Additional clinical symptoms at presentation, although individually weakly correlated with outcome, help broaden sensitivity and refine discrimination of the models. The app provides a visual representation of the predictive outcome as well as attributing clinical protocols adjusted by demographic parameters and prioritized to target the largest contributing factor to overall risk. Conclusions: We derived and validated high performance models of EVD prognosis prediction from the largest and most geographically diverse EVD patients available to date. The performance was maintained during external validations on two independent datasets representing different treatment settings and mortality rates, which suggests that the models could be generalized to new populations. This tool may better inform treatment choices in future EVD outbreaks.

Data generated from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons are often preprocessed into composition or relative abundance. However, reproducibility has been lacking due to the myriad of different experimental and computational approaches taken in these studies. Microbiome studies may report varying results on the same topic, therefore, meta-analyses examining different microbiome studies to provide robust results are important. So far, there is still a lack of implemented methods to properly examine differential relative abundances of microbial taxonomies and to perform meta-analysis examining the heterogeneity and overall effects across microbiome studies. Results: We developed an R package &amp;quot;metamicrobiomeR&amp;quot; that applies Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) with a zero-inflated beta (BEZI) family (GAMLSS-BEZI) for analysis of microbiome relative abundance datasets. Both simulation studies and application to real microbiome data demonstrate that GAMLSS-BEZI well performs in testing differential relative abundances of microbial taxonomies.

Data generated from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons are often preprocessed into composition or relative abundance. However, reproducibility has been lacking due to the myriad of different experimental and computational approaches taken in these studies. Microbiome studies may report varying results on the same topic, therefore, meta-analyses examining different microbiome studies to provide robust results are important. So far, there is still a lack of implemented methods to properly examine differential relative abundances of microbial taxonomies and to perform meta-analysis examining the heterogeneity and overall effects across microbiome studies.

Neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are apicobasally elongated and densely packed in the developing brain, systematically move their nuclei/somata in a cell cycle–dependent manner, called interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM): apical during G2 and basal during G1. Although intracellular molecular mechanisms of individual IKNM have been explored, how heterogeneous IKNMs are collectively coordinated is unknown. Our quantitative cell-biological and in silico analyses revealed that tissue elasticity mechanically assists an initial step of basalward IKNM. When the soma of an M-phase progenitor cell rounds up using actomyosin within the subapical space, a microzone within 10 μm from the surface, which is compressed and elastic because of the apical surface’s contractility, laterally pushes the densely neighboring processes of non–M-phase cells. The pressed processes then recoil centripetally and basally to propel the nuclei/somata of the progenitor’s daughter cells. Thus, indirect neighbor-assisted transfer of mechanical energy from mother to daughter helps efficient brain development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QIHSf4hXHfg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004426</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004426</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagementRate>0.06</engagementRate><recrawled>1524247743047</recrawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162e4278028:4dbf10:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoyasu Shinoda, Arata Nagasaka, Yasuhiro Inoue, Ryo Higuchi, Yoshiaki Minami, Kagayaki Kato, Makoto Suzuki, Takefumi Kondo, Takumi Kawaue, Kanako Saito, Naoto Ueno, Yugo Fukazawa, Masaharu Nagayama, Takashi Miura, Taiji Adachi, Takaki Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

The assessment of competitive movement demands in team sports has traditionally relied upon global positioning system (GPS) analyses presented as fixed-time epochs (e.g., 5–40 min). More recently, presenting game data as a rolling average has become prevalent due to concerns over a loss of sampling resolution associated with the windowing of data over fixed periods. Accordingly, this study compared rolling average (ROLL) and fixed-time (FIXED) epochs for quantifying the peak movement demands of international rugby union match-play as a function of playing position. Elite players from three different squads (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 119) were monitored using 10 Hz GPS during 36 matches played in the 2014–2017 seasons. Players categorised broadly as forwards and backs, and then by positional sub-group (FR: front row, SR: second row, BR: back row, HB: half back, MF: midfield, B3: back three) were monitored during match-play for peak values of high-speed running (&gt;5 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; HSR) and relative distance covered (m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) over 60–300 s using two types of sample-epoch (ROLL, FIXED). Irrespective of the method used, as the epoch length increased, values for the intensity of running actions decreased (e.g., For the backs using the ROLL method, distance covered decreased from 177.4 ± 20.6 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the 60 s epoch to 107.5 ± 13.3 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for the 300 s epoch). For the team as a whole, and irrespective of position, estimates of fixed effects indicated significant between-method differences across all time-points for both relative distance covered and HSR. Movement demands were underestimated consistently by FIXED versus ROLL with differences being most pronounced using 60 s epochs (95% CI HSR: -6.05 to -4.70 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 95% CI distance: -18.45 to -16.43 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). For all HSR time epochs except one, all backs groups increased more (p &amp;lt; 0.01) from FIXED to ROLL than the forward groups. Linear mixed modelling of ROLL data highlighted that for HSR (except 60 s epoch), SR was the only group not significantly different to FR. For relative distance covered all other position groups were greater than the FR (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The FIXED method underestimated both relative distance (~11%) and HSR values (up to ~20%) compared to the ROLL method. These differences were exaggerated for the HSR variable in the backs position who covered the greatest HSR distance; highlighting important consideration for those implementing the FIXED method of analysis. The data provides coaches with a worst-case scenario reference on the running demands required for periods of 60–300 s in length. This information offers novel insight into game demands and can be used to inform the design of training games to increase specificity of preparation for the most demanding phases of matches.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195197</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4602:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel J.

This information offers novel insight into game demands and can be used to inform the design of training games to increase specificity of preparation for the most demanding phases of matches.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195197</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>12889cec</fingerprint><crawled>1522950125206</crawled></item><item><published>1522886400000</published><title>Stochastic tuning of gene expression enables cellular adaptation in the absence of pre-existing regulatory circuitry</title><author><name>st2744@columbia.edu (Amir Momen-Roknabadi)</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31867</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31867</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item><item>Genes and Chromosomes</item></keywords><summary><content>Cells adapt to familiar changes in their environment by activating predefined regulatory programs that establish adaptive gene expression states.

Protein myristoylation is a key protein modification carried out by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) after Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) removes methionine from the amino-terminus of the target protein. Protein myristoylation by NMT augments several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including developmental pathways and pathways that when dysregulated lead to cancer or immune dysfunction. The emerging evidence pointing to NMT-mediated myristoylation as a major cellular regulator underscores the importance of understanding the framework of this type of signaling event. Various studies have investigated the role that myristoylation plays in signaling dysfunction by examining differential gene or protein expression between normal and diseased states, such as cancers or following HIV-1 infection, however no study exists that addresses the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of myristoylation. By performing a large scale bioinformatics and functional analysis of the miRNAs that target key genes involved in myristoylation (NMT1, NMT2, MetAP2), we have narrowed down a list of promising candidates for further analysis. Our condensed panel of miRNAs identifies 35 miRNAs linked to cancer, 21 miRNAs linked to developmental and immune signaling pathways, and 14 miRNAs linked to infectious disease (primarily HIV). The miRNAs panel that was analyzed revealed several NMT-targeting mRNAs (messenger RNA) that are implicated in diseases associated with NMT signaling alteration, providing a link between the realms of miRNA and myristoylation signaling. These findings verify miRNA as an additional facet of myristoylation signaling that must be considered to gain a full perspective.

&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium abscessus&lt;/i&gt;, a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium, are increasingly present in soft tissue infections and chronic lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, and infections are characterized by growth in neutrophil-rich environments. &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; is observed as two distinct smooth and rough morphotypes. The environmental smooth morphotype initiates infection and has a relatively limited ability to activate neutrophils. The rough morphotype has increased virulence and immunogenicity. However, the neutrophil response to the rough morphotype has not been explored. Killing of the smooth and rough strains, including cystic fibrosis clinical isolates, was equivalent. Neutrophil uptake of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; was similar between morphotypes. Mechanistically, both rough and smooth morphotypes enhanced neutrophil reactive oxygen species generation but inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity did not affect &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; viability. However, inhibition of phagocytosis and extracellular traps reduced killing of the smooth morphotype with lesser effects against the rough morphotype. Neutrophils treated with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; released a heat-labile mycobactericidal activity against the rough morphotype, but the activity was heat-tolerant against the smooth morphotype.

The aim of the present study is to differentiate subtypes of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) using ex vivo ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Included were 14 surgically resected hippocampi of patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The resected hippocampi were histologically categorized into subtypes of hippocampal sclerosis (HS type 1 (n = 10), HS type 2 (n = 2) and no-HS (n = 2)) and subsequently scanned on a preclinical 7T MRI acquiring T2-weighted morphology, relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging. On the morphological images, the pyramidal cell layer (PCL) of the hippocampus was segmented and the following parameters were derived: T2 signal intensity, T1-, T2- and T2*-relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Furthermore, the area of the PCL was determined, as well as the parameter product which refers to the widths of the PCL parallel and perpendicular to the stratum moleculare. Spearman correlation coefficient was used to demonstrate relationships between MR-parameters and type of sclerosis. In comparison to no-HS specimens, the PCL was significantly narrower in HS type 1 and HS type 2 hippocampi. This narrowing affected the entire cornu ammonis sector (CA) 1 in HS type 1, while it was limited to the upper half of CA1 in direction to CA2 in HS type 2. The parameter product median increased from 0.43 to 1.67 and 2.91 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for HS type 1, HS type 2 and no-HS, respectively. Correlation coefficients were significant for the PCL parameters product (0.73), area (0.71), T2*-time (-0.67), FA (0.65) and ADC (0.55). Our initial results suggest that HS type 1, HS type 2 and no-HS subtypes can be distinguished from each other using ex vivo UHF MRI based on T2-weighted morphologic images and the assessment of the parameter product. Upon clinical translation, UHF-MRI may provide a promising technique for the preoperative differentiation of HS subtypes in patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196008</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe35:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Clarissa Gillmann, Roland Coras, Karl Rössler, Arnd Doerfler, Michael Uder, Ingmar Blümcke, Tobias Bäuerle&lt;/p&gt;

Alveolar epithelial cells are critical to the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which are associated with overexpression of type 2 cytokine IL-13. IL-13 is known to induce the production of profibrotic (e.g., periostin) and pro-inflammatory (e.g., eotaxin-3) mediators in human airway epithelial cells, but it remains unclear if human primary alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression following IL-13 stimulation. The goals of this study are to determine if alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression upon IL-13 stimulation, and if alveolar and airway epithelial cells from the same subjects have similar responses to IL-13. Paired alveolar and airway epithelial cells were isolated from donors without any lung disease, and cultured under submerged or air-liquid interface conditions with or without IL-13. Up-regulation of periostin protein and mRNA was observed in IL-13-stimulated alveolar epithelial cells, which was comparable to that in IL-13-stimulated paired airway epithelial cells. IL-13 also increased eotaxin-3 expression in alveolar epithelial cells, but the level of eotaxin mRNA was lower in alveolar epithelial cells than in airway epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that human alveolar epithelial cells are able to produce periostin and eotaxin in responses to IL-13 stimulation. This study suggests the need to further determine the contribution of alveolar epithelial cell-derived mediators to pulmonary fibrosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524171600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196256</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df0db9fe:45935cf:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoko Ito, Reem Al Mubarak, Nicole Roberts, Kelly Correll, William Janssen, James Finigan, Rangnath Mishra, Hong Wei Chu&lt;/p&gt;

Inertial sensors offer the potential for integration into wireless virtual reality systems that allow the users to walk freely through virtual environments. However, owing to drift errors, inertial sensors cannot accurately estimate head and body orientations in the long run, and when walking indoors, this error cannot be corrected by magnetometers, due to the magnetic field distortion created by ferromagnetic materials present in buildings. This paper proposes a technique, called EHBD (Equalization of Head and Body Directions), to address this problem using two head- and shoulder-located magnetometers. Due to their proximity, their distortions are assumed to be similar and the magnetometer measurements are used to detect when the user is looking straight forward. Then, the system corrects the discrepancies between the estimated directions of the head and the shoulder, which are provided by gyroscopes and consequently are affected by drift errors. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of this technique in two tasks (navigation and navigation plus exploration) and using two different locomotion techniques: (1) gaze-directed mode (GD) in which the walking direction is forced to be the same as the head direction, and (2) decoupled direction mode (DD) in which the walking direction can be different from the viewing direction. The obtained results show that both locomotion modes show similar matching of the target path during the navigation task, while DD’s path matches the target path more closely than GD in the navigation plus exploration task. These results validate the EHBD technique especially when allowing different walking and viewing directions in the navigation plus exploration tasks, as expected. While the proposed method does not reach the accuracy of optical tracking (ideal case), it is an acceptable and satisfactory solution for users and is much more compact, portable and economical.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195191</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4601:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto de la Rubia, Antonio Diaz-Estrella, Arcadio Reyes-Lecuona, Alyson Langley, Michael Brown, Sarah Sharples&lt;/p&gt;

While the proposed method does not reach the accuracy of optical tracking (ideal case), it is an acceptable and satisfactory solution for users and is much more compact, portable and economical.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195191</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>5fed306f</fingerprint><crawled>1522950125206</crawled></item><item><published>1522270800000</published><title>Correlation between coronary artery calcification by non-cardiac CT and Framingham score in young patients</title><author><name>Gabriel Lichtenstein</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195061</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195061</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel Lichtenstein, Amichai Perlman, Shoshana Shpitzen, Ronen Durst, Dorit Shaham, Eran Leitersdorf, Auryan Szalat&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have established a correlation between coronary artery calcification (CAC) measured by ECG-gated chest computed tomography (CT) and cardiovascular disease. Recent reports which included asymptomatic patients suggest that CAC measured on non-ECG gated CT is similarly associated with cardiovascular risk. This study investigates the correlation between the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and an incidental finding of CAC on a non-gated chest CT performed for non-cardiac indications in young and seemingly healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study that included 162 CT scans performed in young patients aged 18–50 years old for non-cardiac indications in our institution was conducted. CAC score (CACS) was calculated using the Agatston method. FRS was calculated and compared to the CACS using three different approaches. The correlations between the CACS and several specific factors (i.e. age, body mass index, smoking, statins, etc.), were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age of patients was 36.43 year old and 105 (64.8%) were male. We found a significant positive correlation between the CACS and the FRS in all three approaches (p&amp;lt;0.05). Increased age, smoking and statin use were the only individual factors clearly associated with an increase in CACS (p = 0.002, p = 0.045 and p = 0.009, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This is the first report indicating that incidental CACS identified in non-gated MDCT is also associated with cardiovascular risk evaluated by FRS in a young population. Our findings suggest that young asymptomatic individuals with incidental CAC should be seriously evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors despite presumption of belonging to a low cardiovascular risk category.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195061</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4257:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel Lichtenstein, Amichai Perlman, Shoshana Shpitzen, Ronen Durst, Dorit Shaham, Eran Leitersdorf, Auryan Szalat&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract &lt;p&gt;The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a species detection tool is attracting attention from both scientific and applied fields, especially for detecting invasive or rare species. In order to use eDNA as an efficient and reliable tool, however, we need to understand its origin and state as well as factors affecting its degradation. Various biotic and abiotic environmental factors have been proposed to affect degradation of eDNA in aquatic environments and thus to influence detection rates of species. Here, we were interested in two of them, namely UV light, which can break down DNA, and the presence of filter feeders, which can remove DNA and DNA-bound particles. A few, mostly laboratory-based studies have found minor effects of UVB on the degradation of eDNA. Ultraviolet A radiation (UVA), however, has been neglected although it also causes DNA lesions and is 10- to 100-fold more prevalent than UVB when reaching the earth’s surface. Filter feeders are common in aquatic ecosystem, but their effects on eDNA has hitherto been ignored. We conducted a full-factorial aquatic mesocosm experiment under near-natural outdoor conditions manipulating UV radiation as well as the presence of &lt;i&gt;Dreissena polymorpha&lt;/i&gt;, a strong filter feeder capable of filtering cells or organelles containing DNA. Surprisingly, we found that neither UV radiation nor the presence of the filter feeder affected eDNA-based detection rates of macroinvertebrates, even though the experiment took place in summer when UV radiation intensity and filtration activity is high for the chosen experimental site and conditions. These results, in combination with studies from marine or laboratory settings finding no effect of sunlight and its UV components on the detectability of eDNA, suggest that eDNA based species assessments could be relatively robust with respect to our two factors studied.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523048400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195529</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd082:7c9981b6</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elvira Mächler, Maslin Osathanunkul, Florian Altermatt&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Hypertension is a significant global public health problem and recognized as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. This study was designed to assess the current prevalence of hypertension and to explore risk factors associated with hypertension by urban and rural status to guide the prevention and control of hypertension in Jilin province.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A multi-stage stratified random cluster sampling method was used to obtain data on hypertension, which was investigated by physical examination and face-to-face questionnaire in July 2014-December 2015. Sample data were analyzed by complex weighted statistical analysis to estimate blood pressure levels and prevalence of hypertension in the province. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing hypertension rates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of hypertension was significantly higher in rural areas than urban areas (25.93% versus 22.73%, respectively). The rates of hypertension known (46.7% versus 38.1%, respectively), control (13.7% versus 5.0%, respectively), and controlled among treated subjects (38.3% versus 17.5%, respectively) were higher in urban areas than in rural areas (all p &amp;lt; 0.001), while the treatment rate was not statistically significantly different between urban and rural areas (35.9% versus 28.4%, respectively). After adjusting for demographic covariates, hypertension prevalence in rural areas was still significantly greater than in urban areas (adjusted OR = 1.22; 95%CI: 1.10, 1.36; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Common risk factors for hypertension among urban and rural residents included older age; male; married; employed; less education; overweight/obese; greater abdominal waist circumference; family history of hypertension, stroke, or coronary heart disease; current smoker; alcohol consumption; higher visceral adiposity index; and higher body fat percentage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study identified an increased risk for hypertension in rural regions of Jilin province, suggesting that rural hypertension screening and treatment guidelines should receive greater attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195340</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4614:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junnan Wang, Wei Sun, George A.

The growing area of European hazelnut (&lt;i&gt;Corylus avellana&lt;/i&gt; L.) is increasing, as well as the number of producing countries, and there is a pressing need for new improved cultivars. Hazelnut conventional breeding process is slow, due to the length of juvenile phase and the high heterozygosity level. The development of genetic linkage maps and the identification of molecular markers tightly linked to QTL (quantitative trait loci) of agronomic interest are essential tools for speeding up the selection of seedlings carrying desired traits through marker-assisted selection. The objectives of this study were to enrich a previous linkage map and confirm QTL related to time of leaf budburst, using an F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; population obtained by crossing Tonda Gentile delle Langhe with Merveille de Bollwiller. Genotyping-by-Sequencing was used to identify a total of 9,999 single nucleotide polymorphism markers.

The growing area of European hazelnut (&lt;i&gt;Corylus avellana&lt;/i&gt; L.) is increasing, as well as the number of producing countries, and there is a pressing need for new improved cultivars. Hazelnut conventional breeding process is slow, due to the length of juvenile phase and the high heterozygosity level. The development of genetic linkage maps and the identification of molecular markers tightly linked to QTL (quantitative trait loci) of agronomic interest are essential tools for speeding up the selection of seedlings carrying desired traits through marker-assisted selection. The objectives of this study were to enrich a previous linkage map and confirm QTL related to time of leaf budburst, using an F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; population obtained by crossing Tonda Gentile delle Langhe with Merveille de Bollwiller. Genotyping-by-Sequencing was used to identify a total of 9,999 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Well saturated linkage maps were constructed for each parent using the double pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. A reciprocal translocation was detected in Tonda Gentile delle Langhe between two non-homologous chromosomes. Applying a bioinformatic approach, we were able to disentangle ‘pseudo-linkage’ between markers, removing markers around the translocation breakpoints and obtain a linear order of the markers for the two chromosomes arms, for each linkage group involved in the translocation. Twenty-nine QTL for time of leaf budburst were identified, including a stably expressed region on LG_02 of the Tonda Gentile delle Langhe map. The stability of these QTL and their coding sequence content indicates promise for the identification of specific chromosomal regions carrying key genes involved in leaf budburst.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195408</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>809ef603</fingerprint><crawled>1522690928501</crawled></item><item><published>1524159423000</published><title>Inherited variation contributes to autism</title><author><name>Zahn, L.

Genetically-controlled plant resistance can reduce the damage caused by pathogens. However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance. This often occurs quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and a continuing need to develop new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolution of pathogen populations and thus increase genetic resistance durability. These strategies mainly rely on varying different combinations of resistance sources across time (crop rotations) and space. The spatial scale of deployment can vary from multiple resistance sources occurring in a single cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within the same field (cultivar mixtures) or in different fields (mosaics). However, experimental comparison of the efficiency (i.e. ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (i.e. ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown) of landscape-scale deployment strategies presents major logistical challenges. Therefore, we developed a spatially explicit stochastic model able to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes of the four major deployment options described above, including both qualitative resistance (i.e. major genes) and quantitative resistance traits against several components of pathogen aggressiveness: infection rate, latent period duration, propagule production rate, and infectious period duration. This model, implemented in the R package &lt;i&gt;landsepi&lt;/i&gt;, provides a new and useful tool to assess the performance of a wide range of deployment options, and helps investigate the effect of landscape, epidemiological and evolutionary parameters. This article describes the model and its parameterisation for rust diseases of cereal crops, caused by fungi of the genus &lt;i&gt;Puccinia&lt;/i&gt;. To illustrate the model, we use it to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary potential of the combination of a major gene and different traits of quantitative resistance. The comparison of the four major deployment strategies described above will be the objective of future studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7LHbywjCaMk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006067</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006067</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1523565724244</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162baf3e3ad:bf9d20:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Loup Rimbaud, Julien Papaïx, Jean-François Rey, Luke G.

Zinc is an essential micronutrient required for proper structure and function of many proteins. Bacteria regularly encounter zinc depletion and have evolved diverse mechanisms to continue growth when zinc is limited, including the expression of zinc-independent paralogs of zinc-binding proteins. Mycobacteria have a conserved operon encoding four zinc-independent alternative ribosomal proteins (AltRPs) that are expressed when zinc is depleted. It is unknown if mycobacterial AltRPs replace their primary paralogs in the ribosome and maintain protein synthesis under zinc-limited conditions, and if such replacements contribute to their physiology. This study shows that AltRPs from &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; are essential for growth when zinc ion is scarce. Specifically, the deletion mutant of this operon (Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt;) is unable to grow in media containing a high-affinity zinc chelator, while growth of the wild type strain is unaffected under the same conditions. However, when zinc is gradually depleted during growth in zinc-limited medium, the Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; mutant maintains the same growth rate as seen for the wild type strain. In contrast to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; grown with sufficient zinc supplementation that forms shorter cells when transitioning from logarithmic to stationary phase, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; deficient for zinc elongates after the expression of AltRPs in late logarithmic phase. These zinc-depleted bacteria also exhibit a remarkable morphology characterized by a condensed chromosome, increased number of polyphosphate granules, and distinct appearance of lipid bodies and the cell wall compared to the zinc-replete cells. However, the Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; cells fail to elongate and transition into the zinc-limited morphotype, resembling the wild type zinc-replete bacteria instead. Therefore, the &lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; operon in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; has a vital role in continuation of growth when zinc is scarce and in triggering specific morphogenesis during the adaptation to zinc limitation, suggesting that AltRPs can functionally replace their zinc-dependent paralogs, but also contribute to mycobacterial physiology in a unique way.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196300</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba3:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allexa Dow, Sladjana Prisic&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the accuracy, reproducibility and sensitivity to respiratory gating, field strength and ventricle segmentation of hemodynamic force quantification in the left and right ventricles of the heart (LV and RV) using 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and to provide free hemodynamic force analysis software.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A pulsatile flow phantom was imaged using 4D flow MRI and laser-based particle image velocimetry (PIV). Cardiac 4D flow MRI was performed in healthy volunteers at 1.5T (n = 23). Reproducibility was investigated using MR scanners from two different vendors on the same day (n = 8). Subsets of volunteers were also imaged without respiratory gating (n = 17), at 3T on the same day (n = 6), and 1–12 days later on the same scanner (n = 9, median 6 days). Agreement was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Phantom validation showed good accuracy for both scanners (Scanner 1: bias -14±9%, y = 0.82x+0.08, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.96, Scanner 2: bias -12±8%, y = 0.99x-0.08, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.00). Force reproducibility was strong in the LV (0.09±0.07 vs 0.09±0.07 N, bias 0.00±0.04 N, ICC = 0.87) and RV (0.09±0.06 vs 0.09±0.05 N, bias 0.00±0.03, ICC = 0.83). Strong to very strong agreement was found for scans with and without respiratory gating (LV/RV: ICC = 0.94/0.95), scans on different days (ICC = 0.92/0.87), and 1.5T and 3T scans (ICC = 0.93/0.94).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Software for quantification of hemodynamic forces in 4D-flow MRI was developed, and results show high accuracy and strong to very strong reproducibility for both the LV and RV, supporting its use for research and clinical investigations.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke, is linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is characterized by SUR1-TRPM4 (sulfonylurea receptor 1—transient receptor potential melastatin 4) channel upregulation in microvascular endothelium. In humans and rodents with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), the SUR1 antagonist, glibenclamide, reduces hemorrhagic transformation and plasma MMP-9, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that tPA induces protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-mediated, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium, and that SUR1-TRPM4 is required for this process.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R, of 2 and 4 hours duration, respectively, was obtained using conventional middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunolabeling was used to quantify p65 nuclear translocation. Murine and human brain endothelial cells (BEC) were studied &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, without and with NF-κB activation, using immunoblot, zymography and ELISA, patch clamp electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations were used to identify signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R caused prominent nuclear translocation of p65 in microvascular endothelium. NF-κB-activation of BEC caused &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; expression of SUR1-TRPM4 channels. In NF-κB-activated BEC: (i) tPA caused opening of SUR1-TRPM4 channels in a plasmin-, PAR1-, TRPC3- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner; (ii) tPA caused PAR1-dependent secretion of MMP-9; (iii) tonic secretion of MMP-9 by activated BEC was not influenced by SUR1 inhibition; (iv) phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA or the PAR1-agonist, TFLLR, required functional SUR1-TRPM4 channels, with inhibition of SUR1 decreasing tPA-induced MMP-9 secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;tPA induces PAR1-mediated, SUR1-TRPM4-dependent, phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522875600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195526</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ec9:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Volodymyr Gerzanich, Min Seong Kwon, Seung Kyoon Woo, Alexander Ivanov, J.

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) that are symbiotically associated with &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria can kill target insects via direct infection and toxin action. There are limited reports identifying such organisms in the National Park of Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify EPNs and symbiotic bacteria from Nam Nao National Park, Phetchabun Province, Thailand and to evaluate the larvicidal activity of bacteria against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 12 EPN isolates belonging to &lt;i&gt;Steinernema&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heterorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; were obtained form 940 soil samples between February 2014 and July 2016. EPNs were molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;websteri&lt;/i&gt; (10 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates). Symbiotic bacteria were isolated from EPNs and molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (13 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (11 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonica&lt;/i&gt; (1 isolate). For the bioassay, bacterial suspensions were evaluated for toxicity against third to early fourth instar larvae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; spp. The larvae of both &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; species were orally susceptible to symbiotic bacteria. The highest larval mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; was 99% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (bNN112.3_TH) at 96 h, and the highest mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was 98% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (bNN121.4_TH) at 96 h. In contrast to the control groups (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and distilled water), the mortality rate of both mosquito larvae ranged between 0 and 7% at 72 h. Here, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand. Additionally, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; associated with &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand. &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; has potential to be a biocontrol agent for mosquitoes.

Additionally, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; associated with &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand. &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; has potential to be a biocontrol agent for mosquitoes. This investigation provides a survey of the basic diversity of EPNs and symbiotic bacteria in the National Park of Thailand, and it is a bacterial resource for further studies of bioactive compounds.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195681</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>722bed90</fingerprint><crawled>1523469427083</crawled></item><item><published>1523948400000</published><title>Author Correction: Supersaturation-controlled microcrystallization and visualization analysis for serial femtosecond crystallography</title><author><name>Dan Bi Lee</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/jHjzlqjS3mw/s41598-018-24178-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Supersaturation-controlled microcrystallization and visualization analysis for serial femtosecond crystallography&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Supersaturation-controlled microcrystallization and visualization analysis for serial femtosecond crystallography, Published online: 17 April 2018;

This study examined how people evaluate ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors, especially their predictions of the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors (Study 1). Further, it examined the individual effects of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors of an actor on the evaluation of his/her trait by considering the cases where the actor engages in and does not engage in the other behavior (Study 2). Study 1 revealed that the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors was perceived asymmetrically. Specifically, while the likelihood of ordinary prosocial actors to engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors was perceived as high, the same perception was not observed for extraordinary prosocial behaviors. On the other hand, extraordinary prosocial actors were perceived as highly likely to engage in both ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Study 2 revealed that the evaluation of actors who engaged in extraordinary prosocial behaviors but not ordinary prosocial behaviors did not exceed the evaluation of actors who engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors but not extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Additionally, the effect of extraordinary prosocial behaviors was more when the actor also engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors. These results suggest that extraordinary prosocial actors are evaluated highly when they also engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196340</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba5:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ikumi Futamura&lt;/p&gt;

The human amniotic membrane (HAM) is widely used for its wound healing effect in clinical practice, as a feeder for the cell cultivation, or a source of cells to be used in cell therapy. The aim of this study was to find effective and safe enzymatic HAM de-epithelialization method leading to harvesting of both denuded undamaged HAM and viable human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs). The efficiency of de-epithelialization using TrypLE Express, trypsin/ ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), and thermolysin was monitored by hematoxylin and eosin staining and by the measurement of DNA concentration. The cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. Scanning electron microscopy and immunodetection of collagen type IV and laminin α5 chain were used to check the basement membrane integrity. De-epithelialized hAECs were cultured and their stemness properties and proliferation potential was assessed after each passage. The HAM was successfully de-epithelialized using all three types of reagents, but morphological changes in basement membrane and stroma were observed after the thermolysin application.

The human amniotic membrane (HAM) is widely used for its wound healing effect in clinical practice, as a feeder for the cell cultivation, or a source of cells to be used in cell therapy. The aim of this study was to find effective and safe enzymatic HAM de-epithelialization method leading to harvesting of both denuded undamaged HAM and viable human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs). The efficiency of de-epithelialization using TrypLE Express, trypsin/ ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), and thermolysin was monitored by hematoxylin and eosin staining and by the measurement of DNA concentration. The cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. Scanning electron microscopy and immunodetection of collagen type IV and laminin α5 chain were used to check the basement membrane integrity. De-epithelialized hAECs were cultured and their stemness properties and proliferation potential was assessed after each passage.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over motor cortex and trans-spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) modulate corticospinal circuits in healthy and injured subjects. However, their associated effects with physical exercise is still not defined. This study aimed to investigate the effect of three different settings of rTMS and tsDCS combined with treadmill exercise on spinal cord and cortical excitability of healthy subjects. We performed a triple blind, randomized, sham-controlled crossover study with 12 healthy volunteers who underwent single sessions of rTMS (1Hz, 20Hz and Sham) and tsDCS (anodal, cathodal and Sham) associated with 20 minutes of treadmill walking. Cortical excitability was assessed by motor evoked potential (MEP) and spinal cord excitability by the Hoffmann reflex (Hr), nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) and homosynaptic depression (HD). All measures were assessed before, immediately, 30 and 60 minutes after the experimental procedures. Our results demonstrated that anodal tsDCS/treadmill exercise reduced MEP’s amplitude and NFR’s area compared to sham condition, conversely, cathodal tsDCS/treadmill exercise increased NFR’s area. High-frequency rTMS increased MEP’s amplitude and NFR’s area compared to sham condition. Anodal tsDCS/treadmill exercise and 20Hz rTMS/treadmill exercise reduced Hr amplitude up to 30 minutes after stimulation offset and no changes were observed in HD measures. We demonstrated that tsDCS and rTMS combined with treadmill exercise modulated cortical and spinal cord excitability through different mechanisms. tsDCS modulated spinal reflexes in a polarity-dependent way acting at local spinal circuits while rTMS probably promoted changes in the presynaptic inhibition of spinal motoneurons. In addition, the association of two neuromodulatory techniques induced long-lasting changes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195276</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde32:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Plínio Luna Albuquerque, Mayara Campêlo, Thyciane Mendonça, Luís Augusto Mendes Fontes, Rodrigo de Mattos Brito, Katia Monte-Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Aims &lt;p&gt;In the current study we investigated the effects of resisted sprint training on sprinting performance and underlying mechanical parameters (force-velocity-power profile) based on two different training protocols: (i) loads that represented maximum power output (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt;) and a 50% decrease in maximum unresisted sprinting velocity and (ii) lighter loads that represented a 10% decrease in maximum unresisted sprinting velocity, as drawn from previous research (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Soccer [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15 male] and rugby [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21; 9 male and 12 female] club-level athletes were individually assessed for horizontal force-velocity and load-velocity profiles using a battery of resisted sprints, sled or robotic resistance respectively. Athletes then performed a 12-session resisted (10 × 20-m; and pre- post-profiling) sprint training intervention following the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; training protocols had minor effects on sprinting performance (average of -1.4 to -2.3% split-times respectively), and provided trivial, small and unclear changes in mechanical sprinting parameters.

Osteoblast differentiation is a highly regulated process that requires coordinated information from both soluble factors and the extracellular matrix. Among these extracellular stimuli, chemical and physical properties of the matrix are sensed through cell surface receptors such as integrins and transmitted into the nucleus to drive specific gene expression. Here, we showed that the conditional deletion of β1 integrins in the osteo-precursor population severely impacts bone formation and homeostasis both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Mutant mice displayed a severe bone deficit characterized by bone fragility and reduced bone mass. We showed that β1 integrins are required for proper BMP2 dependent signaling at the pre-osteoblastic stage, by positively modulating Smad1/5-dependent transcriptional activity at the nuclear level. The lack of β1 integrins results in a transcription modulation that relies on a cooperative defect with other transcription factors rather than a plain blunted BMP2 response. Our results point to a nuclear modulation of Smad1/5 transcriptional activity by β1 integrins, allowing a tight control of osteoblast differentiation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196021</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fe:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Molly Brunner, Noémie Mandier, Thierry Gautier, Genevieve Chevalier, Anne-Sophie Ribba, Philippe Guardiola, Marc R.

Our results point to a nuclear modulation of Smad1/5 transcriptional activity by β1 integrins, allowing a tight control of osteoblast differentiation.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196021</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>f42ce162</fingerprint><crawled>1524245962605</crawled></item><item><published>1522357200000</published><title>ABO blood groups as a prognostic factor for recurrence in ovarian and vulvar cancer</title><author><name>Céline Montavon Sartorius</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195213</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195213</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Céline Montavon Sartorius, Andreas Schoetzau, Henriette Kettelhack, Daniel Fink, Neville F.

The relationship between ABO blood groups (BG) and risk of incidence in cancers including gynecological cancers has been widely studied, showing increased incidence risk for BG A patients. As available data are inconsistent we investigated whether BG and their anti-glycan antibodies (anti-A and anti-B) have prognostic values in gynecological cancers. We retrospectively evaluated 974 patients with gynecological cancers in three cancer centers (Switzerland and Australia) between 1974 and 2014 regarding the relationships between clinico-pathological findings and the BG. Time to disease recurrence was significantly influenced by BG in patients with ovarian (n = 282) and vulvar (n = 67) cancer. BG O or B patients showed a significantly increased risk for ovarian cancer relapse compared to A, 59% and 82%, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.045; HR O vs A = 1.59 (CI 1.01–2.51) and (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036; HR A vs B = 0.55 (CI 0.32–0.96). Median time to relapse for advanced stage (n = 126) ovarian cancer patients was 18.2 months for BG O and 32.2 for A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031; HR O vs A = 2.07 (CI 1.07–4.02)). BG also significantly influenced relapse-free survival in patients with vulvar cancer (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), with BG O tending to have increased relapse risk compared to A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.089). Blood groups hence associate with recurrence in ovarian and vulvar cancer: women with BG O seem to have a lower ovarian cancer incidence, however are more likely to relapse earlier. The significance of the BG status as a prognostic value is evident and may be helpful to oncologists in prognosticating disease outcome and selecting the appropriate therapy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195213</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde28:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Céline Montavon Sartorius, Andreas Schoetzau, Henriette Kettelhack, Daniel Fink, Neville F.

Fire is a major driver in many ecosystems. Yet, little is known about how different ground-living arthropods survive fire. Using three sampling methods, and time-since-fire (last fire event: 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years), we investigate how ground-living arthropod diversity responds to fire, and how species richness, diversity, abundance, and composition of the four dominant taxa: ants, beetles, cockroaches and mites, respond. We did this in the naturally fire-prone Mediterranean-type scrubland vegetation (fynbos) of the Cape Floristic Region. Surprisingly, overall species richness and diversity was the same for all time-since-fire categories. However, when each dominant taxon was analysed separately, effect of fire on species richness and abundance varied among taxa. This emphasizes that many taxa must be investigated to really understand fire-driven events. We also highlight the importance of using different diversity measures, as fire did not influence species richness and abundance of particular taxa, while it affected others, overall greatly affecting assemblages of all taxa. Rockiness affected species richness, abundance and composition of a few taxa. We found that all time-since-fire categories supported distinctive assemblages. Some indicator species occurred across all time-since-fire categories, while others were restricted to a single time-since-fire category, showing that there is a wide range of responses to fire between taxa. Details of local landscape structure, abiotic and biotic, and frequency and intensity of fire add complexity to the fire-arthropod interaction. Overall, we show that the relationship between fire and arthropods is phylogenetically constrained, having been honed by many millennia of fire events, and highly complex. Present-day species manifest a variety of adaptations for surviving the great natural selective force of fire.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522789200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195414</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f71:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inam Yekwayo, James S.

Accurate viability assessment prior to transplantation could minimize organ discard. Rapid and accurate evaluation of intra-operative donor kidney biopsies is essential for determining which kidneys are eligible for transplantation. The criteria for accepting or rejecting donor kidneys relies heavily on pathologist determination of the percent of glomeruli (determined from a frozen section) that are normal and sclerotic. This percentage is a critical measurement that correlates with transplant outcome. Inter- and intra-observer variability in donor biopsy evaluation is, however, significant. An automated method for determination of percent global glomerulosclerosis could prove useful in decreasing evaluation variability, increasing throughput, and easing the burden on pathologists. Here, we describe the development of a deep learning model that identifies and classifies non-sclerosed and sclerosed glomeruli in whole-slide images of donor kidney frozen section biopsies. This model extends a convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on a large database of digital images. The extended model, when trained on just 48 whole slide images, exhibits slide-level evaluation performance on par with expert renal pathologists. The model substantially outperforms a model trained on image patches of isolated glomeruli. Encouragingly, the model&apos;s performance is robust to slide preparation artifacts associated with frozen section preparation. As the first model reported that identifies and classifies normal and sclerotic glomeruli in frozen kidney sections, and thus the first model reported in the literature relevant to kidney transplantation, it may become an essential part of donor kidney biopsy evaluation in the clinical setting.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292789v1?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16287bdf81c:8ce2fba:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>Transplantable kidneys are in very limited supply.

We show that cherub establishes a molecular link between the RNA-binding proteins Staufen and Syncrip.

Reduced climatic suitability due to climate change in cocoa growing regions of Ghana is expected in the coming decades. This threatens farmers’ livelihood and the cocoa sector. Climate change adaptation requires an improved understanding of existing cocoa production systems and farmers’ coping strategies. This study characterized current cocoa production, income diversification and shade tree management along a climate gradient within the cocoa belt of Ghana. The objectives were to 1) compare existing production and income diversification between dry, mid and wet climatic regions, and 2) identify shade trees in cocoa agroforestry systems and their distribution along the climatic gradient. Our results showed that current mean cocoa yield level of 288kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the dry region was significantly lower than in the mid and wet regions with mean yields of 712 and 849 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. In the dry region, farmers diversified their income sources with non-cocoa crops and off-farm activities while farmers at the mid and wet regions mainly depended on cocoa (over 80% of annual income). Two shade systems classified as medium and low shade cocoa agroforestry systems were identified across the studied regions. The medium shade system was more abundant in the dry region and associated to adaptation to marginal climatic conditions. The low shade system showed significantly higher yield in the wet region but no difference was observed between the mid and dry regions. This study highlights the need for optimum shade level recommendation to be climatic region specific.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195777</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae1:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Issaka Abdulai, Laurence Jassogne, Sophie Graefe, Richard Asare, Piet Van Asten, Peter Läderach, Philippe Vaast&lt;/p&gt;

Epidemiological studies have revealed that noise exposure was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the exact nature of that association remains to be elucidated. The present study is designed to examine the effects of chronic noise exposure on the development of T2DM in combination with a high-fat-diet (HFD) in mice. Here we show that chronic noise exposure at 85 dB SPL (4 h /day, below the safety limit for occupational noise exposure) exaggerated multiple metabolic abnormalities induced by HFD in C57BL/6J male mice, including worsened glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, fasting hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, noise exposure exhibited a paradoxical impact on fat accumulation and circulating levels of free fatty acid, indicating a potential stimulating effect of noise on lipolysis. These results provide first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; supporting evidence for the causative role of noise exposure in diabetogenesis and pinpoint a noise-associated increase in blood free fatty acid levels as a possible mediator accelerating the effect of noise on the development of insulin resistance and T2DM.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522443600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195411</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c5c:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lijie Liu, Yi Huang, Cong Fang, Hongyu Zhang, Jing Yang, Chuanying Xuan, Fanfan Wang, Haiying Lu, Shuangfeng Cao, Yongfang Wang, Shengwei Li, Jun Sha, Mingming Zha, Min Guo, Jian Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Although evidence suggests that dopaminergic systems are involved in pain processing, the effects of dopaminergic interventions on pain remains questionable. This randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was aimed at exploring the effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on experimental pain evoked by cold stimulation and on spontaneous pain in patients with lumbar radicular (neuropathic) pain.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data was collected from 35 patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy (18 men, mean age 56.2±13 years). The following parameters were evaluated before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 minutes subsequent to a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo: cold pain threshold and tolerance in the painful site (ice pack, affected leg) and in a remote non-painful site (12°C water bath, hand), and spontaneous (affected leg) pain intensity (NPS, 0–100).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and twenty minutes following apomorphine (but not placebo) injection, cold pain threshold and tolerance in the hand increased significantly compared to baseline (from a median of 8.0 seconds (IQR = 5.0) to 10 seconds (IQR = 9.0), p = 0.001 and from a median of 19.5 seconds (IQR = 30.2) to 27.0 seconds (IQR = 37.5), p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In addition, apomorphine prolonged cold pain tolerance but not threshold in the painful site (from a median of 43.0 seconds (IQR = 63.0) at baseline to 51.0 seconds (IQR = 78.0) at 120 min, p = 0.02). Apomorphine demonstrated no superiority over placebo in reducing spontaneous pain intensity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous results in healthy subjects, showing that apomorphine increases the ability to tolerate cold pain and therefore suggesting that dopaminergic interventions can have potential clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195287</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4608:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by May Haddad, Dorit Pud, Roi Treister, Erica Suzan, Elon Eisenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Apomorphine demonstrated no superiority over placebo in reducing spontaneous pain intensity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous results in healthy subjects, showing that apomorphine increases the ability to tolerate cold pain and therefore suggesting that dopaminergic interventions can have potential clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195287</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>845996b</fingerprint><crawled>1522950125206</crawled></item><item><published>1523257200000</published><title>Systematic design and experimental demonstration of bianisotropic metasurfaces for scattering-free manipulation of acoustic wavefronts</title><author><name>Junfei Li</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/vRWJ3r1LLfE/s41467-018-03778-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Systematic design and experimental demonstration of bianisotropic metasurfaces for scattering-free manipulation of acoustic wavefronts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic design and experimental demonstration of bianisotropic metasurfaces for scattering-free manipulation of acoustic wavefronts, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03778-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03778-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Acoustic bianisotropy does not exist in natural materials but can be designed with acoustic metamaterials.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 dibetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is frequent and associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard to measure cardiac autonomic neuropathy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta–analysis to evaluate the impact of T2DM on HRV parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; October 2017 using the keywords “diabetes” AND (“heart rate variability” OR “HRV”). Included articles had to report HRV parameters in T2DM patients and healthy controls measured during 24 hours with a Holter–electrocardiogram. Measurements of HRV retieved were: RR–intervals (or Normal to Normal intervals—NN), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), percetange of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), total power, Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio, as per Task Force recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included twenty-five case-control studies with 2,932 patients: 1,356 with T2DM and 1,576 healthy controls. T2DM patients had significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) lower RR–intervals (effect size = –0.61; 95%CI –1.21 to –0.01), lower SDNN (–0.65; –0.83 to –0.47), lower RMSSD (–0.92; –1.37 to –0.47), lower pNN50 (–0.46; –0.84 to –0.09), lower total power (–1.52; –2.13 to –0.91), lower LF (–1.08; –1.46 to –0.69]), and lower HF (–0.79; –1.09 to –0.50).

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence rate and associated factors of co-morbid mental disability among the elderly with motor disability. Data was obtained from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability (CNSSD). 250,752 older adults aged 65 years and above were sampled from 5964 sites, 2980 towns, 734 counties in 31 provinces in China. Descriptive statistics were used for population-weighted numbers and prevalence of co-morbid mental disability by different characteristics. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the association between mental disability, and the factors of co-morbid mental disability among physical disability. Among the elderly with motor disability, 275,607 persons (2.28%, 99% CI: 1.97–2.59) had co-morbid mental disability at the survey time, which was significantly higher than those without motor disability (OR: 2.11, 99% CI: 1.83–2.43). The factors associated with a higher risk of co-morbid mental disability included urban areas (OR: 1.38; 99% CI: 1.04–1.84), east (2.60, 1.76–3.83) or west (1.65, 1.06–2.55) regions, having other co-morbid disabilities (5.93, 4.48–7.85), and having more severe motor disability (Moderate: 1.81, 1.28–2.57; Severe: 2.90, 2.08–4.04; Extremely severe: 4.22, 2.96–6.01). The elderly with motor disability have a high risk of co-morbid mental disability, especially for higher socioeconomic groups. These findings highlight the need of and will be beneficial for implementing more comprehensive prevention and rehabilitation strategies, to prevent and control the emergence and development of multiple disabilities and promote the physical and mental health of the elderly.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195555</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d740:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guo, Ping He, Xinming Song, Gong Chen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;
This study aimed to investigate the prevalence rate and associated factors of co-morbid mental disability among the elderly with motor disability. Data was obtained from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability (CNSSD). 250,752 older adults aged 65 years and above were sampled from 5964 sites, 2980 towns, 734 counties in 31 provinces in China. Descriptive statistics were used for population-weighted numbers and prevalence of co-morbid mental disability by different characteristics. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the association between mental disability, and the factors of co-morbid mental disability among physical disability. Among the elderly with motor disability, 275,607 persons (2.28%, 99% CI: 1.97–2.59) had co-morbid mental disability at the survey time, which was significantly higher than those without motor disability (OR: 2.11, 99% CI: 1.83–2.43). The factors associated with a higher risk of co-morbid mental disability included urban areas (OR: 1.38; 99% CI: 1.04–1.84), east (2.60, 1.76–3.83) or west (1.65, 1.06–2.55) regions, having other co-morbid disabilities (5.93, 4.48–7.85), and having more severe motor disability (Moderate: 1.81, 1.28–2.57; Severe: 2.90, 2.08–4.04; Extremely severe: 4.22, 2.96–6.01).

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be overcome by electrical stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) via a cochlear implant (CI). Restricted CI performance results from the spatial gap between the SGNs and the electrode, but the efficacy of CI is also limited by the degeneration of SGNs as one consequence of SHNL. In the healthy cochlea, the survival of SGNs is assured by endogenous neurotrophic support. Several applications of exogenous neurotrophic supply have been shown to reduce SGN degeneration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In the present study, nanoporous silica nanoparticles (NPSNPs), with an approximate diameter of &amp;lt;100 nm, were loaded with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to test their efficacy as long-term delivery system for neurotrophins. The neurotrophic factor was released constantly from the NPSNPs over a release period of 80 days when the surface of the nanoparticles had been modified with amino groups. Cell culture investigations with NIH3T3 fibroblasts attest a good general cytocompatibility of the NPSNPs. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments with SGNs indicate a significantly higher survival rate of SGNs in cell cultures that contained BDNF-loaded nanoparticles compared to the control culture with unloaded NPSNPs (p&amp;lt;0.001). Importantly, also the amounts of BDNF released up to a time period of 39 days increased the survival rate of SGNs. Thus, NPSNPs carrying BDNF are suitable for the treatment of inner ear disease and for the protection and the support of SGNs. Their nanoscale nature and the fact that a direct contact of the nanoparticles and the SGNs is not necessary for neuroprotective effects, should allow for the facile preparation of nanocomposites, e.g., with biocompatible polymers, to install coatings on implants for the realization of implant-based growth factor delivery systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522184400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194778</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f0a:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadeschda Schmidt, Jennifer Schulze, Dawid P.

Modeling mRNA expression heterogeneity in tumors is a novel powerful approach with the potential to uncover therapeutic targets that benefit subsets of cancer patients.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303396v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>4302146a</fingerprint><crawled>1524272834750</crawled></item><item><published>1523430000000</published><title>Somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1 cause melorheostosis</title><author><name>Heeseog Kang</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>237</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/bH20U-3w7Go/s41467-018-03720-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Somatic activating mutations in &lt;i&gt;MAP2K1&lt;/i&gt; cause melorheostosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somatic activating mutations in &amp;lt;i&gt;MAP2K1&amp;lt;/i&gt; cause melorheostosis, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03720-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03720-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Melorheostosis is characterized by bone overgrowth and associated with pain and functional impairment.

Availability: ELMER (v2.0) is available as an R/Bioconductor package at http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/ with auxiliary data at http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER.data/.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/148726v3?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>ecb192d1</fingerprint><crawled>1522691116421</crawled></item><item><published>1522713600000</published><title>Fast and accurate edge orientation processing during object manipulation</title><author><name>andrew.pruszynski@uwo.ca (J Andrew Pruszynski)</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31200</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31200</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><summary><content>Quickly and accurately extracting information about a touched object&apos;s orientation is a critical aspect of dexterous object manipulation.

The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) is widely used to evaluate processing speed and executive function in patients with multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological disorders. In the PASAT, subjects listen to sequences of digits while continuously reporting the sum of the last two digits presented. Four different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) are usually tested, with difficulty increasing as SOAs are reduced. Ceiling effects are common at long SOAs, while the digit delivery rate often exceeds the subject’s processing capacity at short SOAs, causing some subjects to stop performing altogether. In addition, subjects may adopt an “alternate answer” strategy at short SOAs, which reduces the test’s demands on working-memory and processing speed. Consequently, studies have shown that the number of dyads (consecutive correct answers) is a more sensitive measure of PASAT performance than the overall number of correct sums. Here, we describe a 2.5-minute computerized test, the Dyad-Adaptive PASAT (DA-PASAT), where SOAs are adjusted with a 2:1 staircase, decreasing after each pair of correct responses and increasing after misses. Processing capacity is reflected in the minimum SOA (minSOA) achieved in 54 trials. Experiment 1 gathered normative data in two large populations: 1617 subjects in New Zealand ranging in age from 18 to 65 years, and 214 Californians ranging in age from 18 to 82 years. Minimum SOAs were influenced by age, education, and daily hours of computer-use. Minimum SOA z-scores, calculated after factoring out the influence of these factors, were virtually identical in the two control groups, as were response times (RTs) and dyad ratios (the proportion of hits occurring in dyads). Experiment 2 measured the test-retest reliability of the DA-PASAT in 44 young subjects who underwent three test sessions at weekly intervals. High intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were found for minSOAs (0.87), response times (0.76), and dyad ratios (0.87). Performance improved across test sessions for all measures. Experiment 3 investigated the effects of simulated malingering in 50 subjects: 42% of simulated malingerers produced abnormal (p&amp;lt; 0.05) minSOA z-scores. Simulated malingerers with abnormal scores were distinguished with 87% sensitivity and 69% specificity from control subjects with abnormal scores by excessive differences between training performance and the actual test. Experiment 4 investigated patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI): patients with mild TBI performed within the normal range while patients with severe TBI showed deficits. The DA-PASAT reduces the time and stress of PASAT assessment while gathering sensitive measures of dyad processing that reveal the effects of aging, malingering, and traumatic brain injury on performance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0178148</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7ea:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by David L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a leading cause of premature mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Women of reproductive age are a unique and vulnerable group of RHD patients, due to increased risk of cardiovascular complications and death during pregnancy. Yet, less than 5% of women of childbearing age with RHD in LMICs use contraceptives, and one in five pregnant women with RHD take warfarin despite known teratogenicity. It is unclear whether this suboptimal contraception and anticoagulant use during pregnancy is due to lack of health system resources, limited health literacy, or social pressure to bear children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a mixed methods study of 75 women living with RHD in Uganda. Questionnaires were administered to 50 patients. Transcripts from three focus groups with 25 participants were analyzed using qualitative description methodology.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Several themes emerged from the focus groups, including pregnancy as a calculated risk; misconceptions about side-effects of contraceptives and anticoagulation; reproductive decision-making control by male partners, in-laws, or physicians; abandonment of patients by male partners; and considerable stigma against heart disease patients for both their reproductive and financial limitations (often worse than that directed against HIV patients). All questionnaire respondents were told by physicians that their hearts were not strong enough to support a pregnancy. Only 14% used contraception while taking warfarin. All participants felt that society would look poorly on a woman who cannot have children due to a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study of female RHD patients and their attitudes toward cardiovascular disorders and reproduction. Our results suggest that health programs targeting heart disease in LMICs must pay special attention to the needs of women of childbearing age. There are opportunities for improved family/societal education programs and community engagement, leading to better outcomes and patient empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194030</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad280e:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Y.

Tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, requires two phosphorylation steps to form a competitive inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. Adenylate kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;) has been previously demonstrated to phosphorylate tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate, while creatine kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;), pyruvate kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;) and pyruvate kinase, liver and red blood cell (&lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt;) each have been found to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to the pharmacologically active tenofovir-diphosphate. In the present study, genomic DNA isolated from dried blood spots collected from 505 participants from Bangkok, Thailand; Cape Town, South Africa; and New York City, USA were examined for variants in &lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt; using next-generation sequencing. The bioinformatics tools SIFT and PolyPhen predicted that 19 of the 505 individuals (3.7% frequency) carried variants in at least one kinase that would result in a decrease or loss of enzymatic activity. To functionally test these predictions, AK2 and AK2 variants were expressed in and purified from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, followed by investigation of their activities towards tenofovir. Interestingly, we found that purified AK2 had the ability to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to tenofovir-diphosphate in addition to phosphorylating tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate. Further, four of the six AK2 variants predicted to result in a loss or decrease of enzyme function exhibited a ≥30% decrease in activity towards tenofovir in our in vitro assays. Of note, an AK2 K28R variant resulted in a 72% and 81% decrease in the formation of tenofovir-monophosphate and tenofovir-diphosphate, respectively. These data suggest that there are naturally occurring genetic variants that could potentially impact TFV activation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523480400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d3:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dominique B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) induces a systemic inflammatory state affecting iron homeostasis. Patients with TB often have additional comorbidities such as anemia which can result in poorer treat outcomes. We studied the contribution of anemia and the role of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin among TB patients and household contacts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed serum samples from 102 TB cases and 98 controls without TB, matched by age/sex, for hepcidin, iron, and inflammation parameters. Five controls developed TB within 12 months. We used linear regression to assess associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) was more frequent among cases than controls (59.8% vs. 26.1%), but iron-deficiency anemia more frequent in controls (10% vs. 1%). The median hepcidin level was higher in cases than controls (63.7 vs. 14.2 ng/mL), but coinfections with HIV, helminths, and respiratory pathogens did not show cumulative effects. Hepcidin was associated with more severe TB symptom scoring (coefficient 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5–1.2) and higher mycobacterial load (0.7, 95% CI 0.4–1.0). Hepcidin was higher in TB cases and controls who developed TB compared to controls without TB (p&amp;lt;0.001), even when restricting to HIV-negative study participants.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;ACD was the predominate etiology in TB patients suggesting limited benefit from iron supplementation. Increased hepcidin levels long before active disease, indicating altered iron metabolism, may be a marker for developing disease among TB-exposed individuals. Clinical management of anemia and nutrition interventions in TB patients need to be considered to improve the clinical course and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195985</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fd:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jerry Hella, Colin I.

Increased hepcidin levels long before active disease, indicating altered iron metabolism, may be a marker for developing disease among TB-exposed individuals. Clinical management of anemia and nutrition interventions in TB patients need to be considered to improve the clinical course and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195985</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>946dbf9a</fingerprint><crawled>1524245962605</crawled></item><item><published>1521838800000</published><title>Expand your body when you look at yourself: The role of the posture in a mirror exposure task</title><author><name>Marta Miragall</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194686</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194686</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>False</unread><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marta Miragall, Ernestina Etchemendy, Ausiàs Cebolla, Víctor Rodríguez, Carlos Medrano, Rosa María Baños&lt;/p&gt;
Mirror exposure (ME) is one of the main components of the treatment of patients with eating disorders symptomatology and it has shown its effectiveness in improving several outcomes (e.g., body dissatisfaction). However, the study as to what body posture should be adopted to maximize its effectiveness has been neglected. From embodied cognition and emotion theories, the adoption of an expansive (vs. contractive) body posture has been associated with positive changes in cognitive and emotional responses. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of adopting an expansive (vs. contractive) posture before an ME task on body-related emotions and cognitions, as well as to analyze the possible moderator and mediator variables of these relationships. The sample was composed of 68 women (age: &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 21.74, &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 3.12) with high scores on body dissatisfaction. Participants were randomly assigned to the expansive or contractive condition, where the openness of the arms/legs and the back position were manipulated. Posture was monitored by an electronic device and participants filled out several self-reported measures. ANCOVAs, moderation, mediation, and moderated mediated analyses were performed. Results showed that women in the expansive condition showed higher positive emotions after the ME. Moreover, exploratory analyses showed that adopting an expansive posture improved positive emotions, leading to improvements in negative emotions, body image satisfaction, and appraisal of the person’s own body. Psychological interventions should explore the value of holding an expansive posture before the ME in women with body dissatisfaction.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1521838800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194686</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51cf:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marta Miragall, Ernestina Etchemendy, Ausiàs Cebolla, Víctor Rodríguez, Carlos Medrano, Rosa María Baños&lt;/p&gt;

Protein trafficking within cilia is mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery composed of large protein complexes. The BBSome consists of eight BBS proteins encoded by causative genes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and has been implicated in the trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), by connecting the IFT machinery to cargo GPCRs. Membrane recruitment of the BBSome to promote cargo trafficking has been proposed to be regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase ARL6/BBS3, through its interaction with the BBS1 subunit of the BBSome. We here investigated how the BBSome core subcomplex composed of BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 assembles and interacts with ARL6, and found that the ARL6–BBS1 interaction is reinforced by BBS9. &lt;i&gt;BBS1&lt;/i&gt;-knockout (KO) cells showed defects in the ciliary entry of other BBSome subunits and ARL6, and in ciliary retrograde trafficking and the export of the GPCRs, Smoothened and GPR161. The trafficking defect of these GPCRs was rescued by the exogenous expression of wild-type BBS1, but not by its mutant lacking BBS9-binding ability. Our data thus indicate that the intact BBSome is required for retrograde trafficking of GPCRs out of cilia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195005</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4252:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shohei Nozaki, Yohei Katoh, Takuya Kobayashi, Kazuhisa Nakayama&lt;/p&gt;

We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of combined use of salivary gland ultrasonography (US) and the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatic Disease (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for improving the diagnostic efficiency in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). A US-based salivary gland disease grading system was developed using a cohort comprising 213 SS or non-SS patients who fulfilled the minimum requirements for classifying SS based on the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and ACR criteria. Using 62 SS or non-SS patients from the 213 patients and who had also undergone all the 5 examinations needed for the ACR/EULAR classification, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of various combinations of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications for diagnosing SS, using the clinical diagnosis of SS by rheumatologists as the gold standard. The ACR/EULAR criteria discriminated clinical SS patients with 77% and 79% accuracy for those with primary or secondary SS and for those with primary SS, respectively. However, the integrated score system of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications yielded 92% and 93% accuracy for these 2 SS patient groups, respectively, provided that US score of 3 was assigned to patients with US grade ≥2, and then patients with integrated threshold score of ≥5 were diagnosed as SS. Cross-validation also indicated improved accuracy of the integrated ACR/EULAR and US score system (91.9 and 93.0% for primary/secondary and primary SS patients, respectively) over that by the ACR/EULAR criteria alone. (74.2 and 86.0%, respectively). The integrated ACR/EULAR and US scoring system can improve the diagnosis of patients with clinical SS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522789200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195113</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f57:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yukinori Takagi, Hideki Nakamura, Misa Sumi, Toshimasa Shimizu, Yasuko Hirai, Yoshiro Horai, Ayuko Takatani, Atsushi Kawakami, Sato Eida, Miho Sasaki, Takashi Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Psychoactive substances are often regarded as causal factors contributing to violent injuries, sexual abuse and homicides. While these effects have been demonstrated for some substances (e.g. cocaine), current available data for others are more controversial (e.g. cannabis) or very limited (e.g. ecstasy).&lt;/p&gt; Aims of the study &lt;p&gt;To collect data on the type and frequency of psychoactive substance use in cases of emergency department (ED) presentations related to interpersonal violence.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective study at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, between May 2012 and June 2016. The study covered cases of violent crime associated with psychoactive substances. Cases of isolated ethanol intoxication, suicide attempts, and substance use for medical purposes were excluded.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study included 103 cases among the 164,846 ED attendances. In the majority of the cases, the type of violence was bodily force (52%) related to urban violence (83%). The mean patient age was 29 years and 79% were male. 63% of the patients reported use of more than one drug; alcohol co-use was reported in 60% of the cases. Besides alcohol, the substances most often reported were cannabis (50%) and cocaine (21%). Alcohol and cannabis was also the most commonly reported substance combination (36% of the total cases). Urine drug screening was performed in 34% of the cases and cannabis and cocaine were the most commonly detected substances (46% and 19%, respectively). There were no cases of novel substances. 23% of the patients were admitted to a hospital ward, 10% to a psychiatric clinic.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Cannabis and cocaine were, besides alcohol, the substances most often reported in ED presentations related to offences of violence.

Objective &lt;p&gt;In this qualitative study, we aimed to provide an in-depth exploration of cancer-related psychological distress experienced by young survivors of cancer during adolescence reporting a need for psychological support.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two individual interviews were held with ten young survivors of cancer diagnosed in adolescence. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis followed the guidelines for inductive qualitative manifest content analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The survivors described distress experienced during and after the end of treatment. Five categories comprising 14 subcategories were generated. The categories included: A tough treatment, Marked and hindered, Not feeling good enough, Struggling with the fragility of life, and finally, An ongoing battle with emotions.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Young survivors of adolescent cancer reporting a need for psychological support described feeling physically, socially, and mentally marked by the cancer experience. They struggled with powerlessness, insecurity, social disconnection, loneliness, and feelings of being unimportant and a failure, and had difficulties understanding and managing their experiences. These concerns should be addressed in psychological treatments for the population irrespective of which approach or model is used to understand survivors’ difficulties. A trans-diagnostic approach targeting processes that underpin different manifestations of distress may be effective.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523998800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195899</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344159:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Malin Ander, Jenny Thorsell Cederberg, Louise von Essen, Emma Hovén&lt;/p&gt;

The main drawback of ranking of researchers by the number of papers, citations or by the Hirsch index is ignoring the problem of distributing authorship among authors in multi-author publications. So far, the single-author or multi-author publications contribute to the publication record of a researcher equally. This full counting scheme is apparently unfair and causes unjust disproportions, in particular, if ranked researchers have distinctly different collaboration profiles. These disproportions are removed by less common fractional or authorship-weighted counting schemes, which can distribute the authorship credit more properly and suppress a tendency to unjustified inflation of co-authors. The urgent need of widely adopting a fair ranking scheme in practise is exemplified by analysing citation profiles of several highly-cited astronomers and astrophysicists. While the full counting scheme often leads to completely incorrect and misleading ranking, the fractional or authorship-weighted schemes are more accurate and applicable to ranking of researchers as well as research teams.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins. We therefore investigated whether SWAN can help predict ischemic penumbra-like lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) records—including SWAN, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)—of consecutive patients with major vessel occlusion within 6 h from AIS onset were analyzed. Acute recanalization was defined as an arterial occlusive lesion score of 2–3. A modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (mASPECTS) was used to evaluate ischemic areas revealed by SWAN and DWI. SWAN- and DWI-based mASPECTSs were calculated, and correlations between DWI-SWAN mismatches with final infarct lesions or clinical outcomes were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 35 patients included in this study, we confirmed cardioembolic stroke in 26, atherothrombotic stroke in 4, and unknown stroke etiology in 5. Overall, recanalization was achieved in 23 patients, who showed a higher follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and lower modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days than patients without recanalization. Initial SWAN- and follow-up DWI-based mASPECTSs were significantly higher for atherothrombotic stroke than for cardioembolic stroke. Of 12 patients without recanalization, DWI-SWAN mismatch was significantly correlated with infarct growth. Patients with recanalization showed no such correlation. In the assessment of clinical outcome, follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and patient&apos;s age were significantly correlated with mRS at 90 days after stroke. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS was independently associated with a favorable outcome 90 days after stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For patients with AIS, DWI-SWAN mismatch might show penumbra-like lesions that would predict infarct growth without acute recanalization.

This study investigated the role of individual differences (dark personality) and situational factors (perceived organisational support) in explaining intention to quit. Four hundred and fifty-one (50 of which females) ambulance personnel completed three questionnaires (Hogan Development Survey; Perceived Organisational Support Survey; and a single item Intention to Quit measure) as a part of a selection and development assessment. Employees high on Excitable, Sceptical, and Mischievous, but low on Colourful were found to have greater intentions to quit. Additionally, employees high on Excitable, Sceptical, Reserved, and Leisurely, but low on Dutiful and Diligent had lower perceptions of organisational support. Structural Equation Modelling revealed that perceived organisational support plays both a mediating and moderating role on dark personality and intention to quit.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. Over the past several decades, many &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous and woody plants. However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (&lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt;) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aed:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chunhua Zhang, Ruchao Feng, Ruijuan Ma, Zhijun Shen, Zhixiang Cai, Zhizhong Song, Bin Peng, Mingliang Yu&lt;/p&gt;

However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (&lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt;) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><fingerprint>5fa2e0ac</fingerprint><crawled>1523900347166</crawled></item><item><published>1522652400000</published><title>MVP: predicting pathogenicity of missense variants by deep learning [NEW RESULTS]</title><author><name>Qi, H.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259390v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/02/259390</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><content><content>Accurate pathogenicity prediction of missense variants is critical to improve power in genetic studies and accurate interpretation in clinical genetic testing.

&lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; is the most speciose genus of the order Cingulata, including approximately 40% of known living armadillos. Nine species are currently recognized, although comprehensive analyses of the entire genus have never been done. Our aim is to revise the taxonomy of the long-nosed armadillos and properly define the taxa. We examined 2126 specimens of &lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; preserved in 39 different museum collections, including 17 type specimens. Three complementary methods were applied to explore morphological datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative morphological variation in discrete characters was assessed by direct observations of specimens. Linear morphometric variation was based on external data and cranial measurements of 887 adult skulls. The shape and size of the skull was abstracted through two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of dorsal, lateral and ventral views of respectively 421, 211, and 220 adult specimens. Our results converge on the recognition of eight living species (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;beniensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kappleri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mazzai&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;novemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pastasae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pilosus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sabanicola&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;), and three subspecies of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hybridus&lt;/i&gt;, and a new subspecies from Cordoba described here).

The domain-exchanged construct, including variable domains of the HER2/neu specific antibody trastuzumab, was able to bind to the surface of the strongly HER2/neu positive cell line SK-BR3 4-fold weaker than trastuzumab, but could nevertheless incite a more potent response in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) reporter assay with FcγRIIIa-overexpressing T-cells.

Prefrontal anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed as a potential approach to improve inhibitory control performance. The functional consequences of tDCS during inhibition tasks remain, however, largely unresolved. We addressed this question by analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recorded while participants completed a Go/NoGo task after right-lateralized prefrontal anodal tDCS with a crossover, sham-controlled, double-blind experimental design. We replicated previous evidence for an absence of offline effect of anodal stimulation on Go/NoGo performance. The fMRI results revealed a larger increase in right ventrolateral prefrontal activity for Go than NoGo trials in the anodal than sham condition. This pattern suggests that tDCS-induced increases in cortical excitability have larger effects on fMRI activity in regions with a lower task-related engagement. This was the case for the right prefrontal cortex in the Go condition in our task because while reactive inhibition was not engaged during execution trials, the unpredictability of the demand for inhibitory control still incited an engagement of proactive inhibition. Exploratory analyses further revealed that right prefrontal stimulation interacted with task-related functional demands in the supplementary motor area and the thalamus. Our collective results emphasize the dependency of offline tDCS functional effects on the task-related engagement of the stimulated areas and suggest that this factor might partly account for the discrepancies in the functional effects of tDCS observed in previous studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194936</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424c:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Etienne Sallard, Michael Mouthon, Michael De Pretto, Lucas Spierer&lt;/p&gt;

First off, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/17/approvals-and-otherwise-in-oncology&quot;&gt;this 2015 post&lt;/a&gt; mentions the steep drop in shares of Clovis Biotechnology, brought on by a rather sudden revision in the announced clinical performance of their lead drug (the covalent kinase inhibitor rociletinib). Well, it appears that the SEC found this to be rather abrupt as well, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/more-than-2-years-after-the-ugly-roci-debacle-clovis-says-that-the-sec-is-prepping-civil-charges/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endpts&lt;/em&gt; now reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company has been under investigation. Some of their investors have long claimed that the presentation of the clinical data had been manipulated in order to keep the company’s stock price up, and it looks like that theory is getting a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth remembering the different time scales involved. Think of the different parts of a cell: you get fast service from receptors and second-messenger systems (starting on a time scale of less than a second), but if you’re waiting for proteins to be synthesized, you need to come back in a few hours. Likewise the stock market reacts pretty quickly to bad news (Clovis got sold off on that news as if the shares were giving off radon gas), but the regulatory authorities are much slower. That said, they’re also pretty hard to dislodge once they get a fix on your position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the markets can take a while to react to things, too, because it’s differences of opinion that make them work in the first place. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/07/30/another_alzheimers_ipo&quot;&gt;Here’s another post&lt;/a&gt; from 2015 where I wrote about the IPO of a company (vTv Therapeutics, formerly TransTech) trying to make a go of it with a retread Alzheimer’s therapy. The comparison with Axovant was obvious at the time, and some readers will recall &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/09/27/bad-news-but-not-the-unexpected-kind&quot;&gt;what eventually happened to them&lt;/a&gt; when their own drug failed yet again in an Alzheimer’s trial. As that post mentioned, I was short Axovant stock when that took place (an event that financed the purchase of a new 18-inch Dobsonian telescope around here). Well, vTv &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xconomy.com/raleigh-durham/2018/04/09/with-alzheimers-failure-vtv-fares-no-better-than-old-partner-pfizer/&quot;&gt;announced their own clinical trial results&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, and to no one’s particular surprise, the compound failed for them, just as it had for Pfizer back in the day when TransTech had licensed it to them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s stock had been up over $7 earlier in the year, on what I thought was rather misplaced optimism. I sold them short in January at $7.42, and have been careful not to write about them in any way since doing so (in fact, I haven’t mentioned them at all since that 2015 post). VTVT &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/vtvt?p=vtvt&quot;&gt;had been dropping&lt;/a&gt; since then, and was back down in the $3 range before they announced this news, but that failed trial sent them down steeply. At that point I naturally covered my position, which is one reason I mention it now. The stock is trading this morning at about $0.67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know, if someone else comes along with a drug that’s already failed one or two Alzheimer’s trials, I’m very likely to short them, too. One of these days some odd AD mechanism is (I hope) going to work, but given the odds of clinical success, financing things like Axovant’s or vTv’s drugs that have &lt;em&gt;already failed in the clinic&lt;/em&gt; seems like a bad idea. And that’s the other reason I’m bringing up my short sales of these companies: I (and the other people who were also short these outfits) should actually not be handed such opportunities. Axovant and vTv should not, in a more rational market, have been able to go public as blithely as they did with the assets that they had, and their market caps should not have achieved what heights they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great time to finance small biopharma companies (and here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LifeSciVC/status/983763134090530816&quot;&gt;a series of Twitter posts&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Booth with some good advice on that subject). But with all this money sloshing around, some of it (as always under these conditions) is going into some rather stupid ideas. &lt;em&gt;Caveat investor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13451</link><summary><content>Here are some sequels to stories I’ve written about here, things that have had some new chapters added to them.

We test the hypothesis that prehistoric Native American land use influenced the Euro-American settlement process in a South Carolina Piedmont landscape. Long term ecological studies demonstrate that land use legacies influence processes and trajectories in complex, coupled social and ecological systems. Native American land use likely altered the ecological and evolutionary feedback and trajectories of many North American landscapes. Yet, considerable debate revolves around the scale and extent of land use legacies of prehistoric Native Americans. At the core of this debate is the question of whether or not European colonists settled a mostly “wild” landscape or an already “humanized” landscape. We use statistical event analysis to model the effects of prehistoric Native American settlement on the rate of Colonial land grants (1749–1775). Our results reveal how abandoned Native American settlements were among the first areas claimed and homesteaded by Euro-Americans. We suggest that prehistoric land use legacies served as key focal nodes in the Colonial era settlement process. As a consequence, localized prehistoric land use legacies likely helped structure the long term, landscape- to regional-level ecological inheritances that resulted from Euro-American settlement.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195036</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1d:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>17</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael R.

To navigate their surroundings, cells rely on sensory input that is corrupted by noise. In cells performing chemotaxis, such noise arises from the stochastic binding of signalling molecules at low chemoattractant concentrations. We reveal a fundamental relationship between the speed of chemotactic steering and the strength of directional fluctuations that result from the amplification of noise in a chemical input signal. This relation implies a trade-off between steering that is slow and reliable, and steering that is fast but less reliable. We show that dynamic switching between these two modes of steering can substantially increase the probability to find a target, such as an egg to be found by sperm cells. This decision making confers no advantage in the absence of noise, but is beneficial when chemical signals are detectable, yet characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios. The latter applies at intermediate distances from a target, where signalling molecules are diluted, thus defining a ‘noise zone’ that cells have to cross. Our results explain decision making observed in recent experiments on sea urchin sperm chemotaxis. More generally, our theory demonstrates how decision making enables chemotactic agents to cope with high levels of noise in gradient sensing by dynamically adjusting the persistence length of a biased random walk.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0k29V7Enzbw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524171600000</updated><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006109</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006109</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><recrawled>1524170525281</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162df187f34:50ab5:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Justus A.
