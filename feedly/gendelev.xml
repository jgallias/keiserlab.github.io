However, computational identification of lncRNAs in a wide range of species remains challenging; it requires prior knowledge of well-established sequences and annotations or species-specific training data, but the reality is that only a limited number of species have high-quality sequences and annotations. Here we first characterize lncRNAs by contrast to protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship and find that the feature relationship between ORF (open reading frame) length and GC content presents universally substantial divergence in lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs, as observed in a broad variety of species. Based on the feature relationship, accordingly, we further present LGC, a novel algorithm for identifying lncRNAs that is able to accurately distinguish lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs in a cross-species manner without any prior knowledge. As validated on large-scale empirical datasets, comparative results show that LGC outperforms existing algorithms by achieving higher accuracy, well-balanced sensitivity and specificity, and is robustly effective (&gt;90% accuracy) in discriminating lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs across diverse species that range from plants to mammals. To our knowledge, this study, for the first time, differentially characterizes lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship, which is further applied in computational identification of lncRNAs. Taken together, our study represents a significant advance in characterization and identification of lncRNAs and LGC thus bears broad potential utility for computational analysis of lncRNAs in a wide range of species.</description><crawled>1527704765564</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>The significance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in many biological processes and diseases has gained intense interests over the past several years.

We further characterize the dynamics of the water, as well as the hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules and the nanotube, which are found to be more than one order of magnitude longer than water–water hydrogen bonds.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><crawled>1526918414313</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1526860800000</published><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163836dffe9:66b75cd:93d646dc</id><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><unread>True</unread></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05344-1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saving the climate without sacrifice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saving the climate without sacrifice, Published online: 04 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05344-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05344-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Modern trends such as car-sharing could help to limit warming.</description><fingerprint>e9cdd401</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05344-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Saving the climate without sacrifice</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05344-1</link><crawled>1528134430833</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saving the climate without sacrifice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saving the climate without sacrifice, Published online: 04 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05344-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05344-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Modern trends such as car-sharing could help to limit warming.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528095600000</published><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163cbe8f071:4e526d4:7cfe07d6</id><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05344-1/d41586-018-05344-1_15816128.jpg</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><unread>True</unread></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><keywords><item>Astronomy, Planetary Science</item></keywords><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/698?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/698.full</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>29af1ab9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/698?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>China&apos;s moon mission is set to probe cosmic dark ages</title><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1526578752000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/698?rss=1</link><author><name>Clery, D.</name></author><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395db:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><description>The vascular pathogen&lt;i&gt; Verticillium dahliae&lt;/i&gt; infects the roots of plants to cause &lt;i&gt;Verticillium&lt;/i&gt; wilt.

Heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans and mice cause severe ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). Abnormalities include pupil displacement, corneal opacity, iridocorneal adhesions, and variable intraocular pressure, as well as some retinal and vascular defects. It is presently not known what source of BMP4 is responsible for these defects, as BMP4 is expressed in several developing ocular and surrounding tissues. In particular, BMP4 is expressed in the ciliary margins of the optic cup which give rise to anterior segment structures such as the ciliary body and iris, making it a good candidate for the required source of BMP4 for anterior segment development. Here, we test whether ciliary margin-derived BMP4 is required for ocular development using two different conditional knockout approaches. In addition, we compared the conditional deletion phenotypes with &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous null mice. Morphological, molecular, and functional assays were performed on adult mutant mice, including histology, immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging, and intraocular pressure measurements. Surprisingly, in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mutants, our analyses revealed that the anterior and posterior segments of &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockouts developed normally. These results indicate that ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development, although subtle alterations could not be ruled out. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anterior and posterior phenotypes observed in &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous animals showed a strong propensity to co-occur, suggesting a common, non-cell autonomous source for these defects.</description><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.

Brain region-specific alterations in neuronal density and composition originate prenatally in trisomy 21 individuals, and are presumed to underlie the intellectual disability and early onset neurodegeneration that characterizes Down syndrome. However, the mechanisms by which chromosome 21 aneuploidy drives alterations in the central nervous system are not well understood, particularly in brain regions that are uniquely human and thus inaccessible to established animal models. Cerebral organoids are pluripotent stem cell derived models of prenatal brain development that have been used to deepen our understanding of the atypical processes associated with human neurobiological disorders, and thus provide a promising avenue to explore the molecular basis for neurodevelopmental alterations in trisomy 21. Here, we employ high-resolution label-free mass spectrometry to map proteomic changes over the course of trisomy 21 cerebral organoid development, and evaluate the proteomic alterations in response to treatment with harmine, a small molecule inhibitor of the chromosome 21 encoded protein kinase DYRK1A. Our results reveal trisomy 21 specific dysregulation of networks associated with neurogenesis, axon guidance and extracellular matrix remodeling. We find significant overlap of these networks with previously identified dysregulated gene expression modules identified in trisomy 21 fetal brain tissue. We show that harmine leads to partial normalization of key regulators of cortical development, including WNT7A and the transcription factors TBR1, BCL11A, and POU3F2, pointing to a causative role for DYRK1A over-expression in neurodevelopmental effects of human trisomy 21.</description><crawled>1525556242891</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>Human trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, and is associated with complex perturbations in protein expression during development.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is relatively high in the southern regions of China. Yunnan, located in southwestern China, has the highest number of ethnic groups. However, HEV infection in the ethnic population is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the seropositive rate, risk factor, and clinical impact of HEV infection in the ethnic groups of Yunnan. We recruited 1912 individuals from four minority groups in three prefectures of Yunnan province. Epidemiological records on potential risk factors for exposure to HEV and blood biochemical index were analyzed. All the serum samples were tested for anti-HEV IgM/IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the IgM-positive samples were subjected to nested reverse transcription-PCR to detect HEV RNA. Overall, 1273 individuals (66.58%) were positive for anti-HEV IgG, 16 (0.84%) for anti-HEV IgM, and 64 (3.35%) for anti-HEV IgG and IgM both; none of them had detectable HEV RNA. Multivariate analysis revealed a strong statistical association between ethnic origin and HEV IgG seroprevalence. Anti-HEV IgG reactivity in the Hani ethnic (82.3%; 401/487) population was higher than that in the Naxi (71.9%, 340/473), Bulang (65.1%; 302/464), and Wa (60.2%; 294/488) ethnic populations (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Older age and male sex were independently associated with the risk of past HEV infection. Moreover, anti-HEV IgG-positive individuals showed significantly higher levels of total and direct bilirubin and alanine amino transferase but significantly lower levels of globulin and low-density lipoprotein, than the respective levels in anti-HEV IgG-negative individuals. Thus, the seroprevalence of HEV infection is high in the ethnic populations of Yunnan, China. It is therefore necessary to increase the surveillance of specific risk groups and raise awareness about the possible infectious diseases to help limit the HEV transmission here.</description><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yue Feng, Yue-Mei Feng, Songmei Wang, Fang Xu, Xuehui Zhang, Chunyue Zhang, Yuanyuan Jia, Wanru Yang, Xueshan Xia, Jianzhong Yin&lt;/p&gt;

It is therefore necessary to increase the surveillance of specific risk groups and raise awareness about the possible infectious diseases to help limit the HEV transmission here.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527022800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197577</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197577</canonicalUrl><author><name>Yue Feng</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709405c:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Bing Xiao, Lars Stixrude</name></author><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5371.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5371</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>95f4a12</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5371.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Critical vaporization of MgSiO3 [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences]</title><unread>True</unread><description>Inhomogeneous ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that vaporization of MgSiO3 is incongruent and that the vapor phase is dominated by SiO and O2 molecules.

In cancer research, for example, the open cancer resources such as TCGA and TARGET do not provide matched tissue samples for every cancer or cancer subtype. The recent GTEx project has profiled samples from healthy individuals, providing an excellent resource for this field, yet the feasibility of using GTEx samples as the reference remains unanswered. Methods: We analyze RNA-Seq data processed from the same computational pipeline and systematically evaluate GTEx as a potential reference resource. We use those cancers that have adjacent normal tissues in TCGA as a benchmark for the evaluation. To correlate tumor samples and normal samples, we explore top varying genes, reduced features from principal component analysis, and encoded features from an autoencoder neural network. We first evaluate whether these methods can identify the correct tissue of origin from GTEx for a given cancer and then seek to answer whether disease expression signatures are consistent between those derived from TCGA and from GTEx. Results: Among 32 TCGA cancers, 18 cancers have less than 10 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. Among three methods, autoencoder performed the best in predicting tissue of origin, with 12 of 14 cancers correctly predicted. The reason for misclassification of two cancers is that none of normal samples from GTEx correlate well with any tumor samples in these cancers. This suggests that GTEx has matched tissues for the majority cancers, but not all. While using autoencoder to select proper normal samples for disease signature creation, we found that disease signatures derived from normal samples selected via an autoencoder from GTEx are consistent with those derived from adjacent samples from TCGA in many cases. Interestingly, choosing top 50 mostly correlated samples regardless of tissue type performed reasonably well or even better in some cancers. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that samples from GTEx can serve as reference normal samples for cancers, especially those do not have available adjacent tissue samples. A deep-learning based approach holds promise to select proper normal samples.</description><crawled>1527956008434</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>Background: Normal tissue samples are often employed as a control for understanding disease mechanisms, however, collecting matched normal tissues from patients is difficult in many instances.

A series of novel benzo[b]quinolizinium cations as NMDA receptor antagonists have been used as a starting point to develop prognostic pharmacophore models. The most predictive pharmacophore model (hypothesis 1), consisting of four features, namely, one hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrophobic and two ring aromatic, showed a correlation (r) of 0.89, root mean square of 0.259, and the cost difference of 43.01 bits between null and fixed cost. The model was thoroughly validated and subjected to a chemical database search, which lead to the identification of 400 hits from NCI and Maybridge databases which were checked for Lipinski&apos;s violation and predictive potency.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We assessed for the first time whether urinary free light chains (FLC) are independently associated with risk of ESRD in patients with CKD, and whether they offer incremental value in risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We measured urinary FLCs in 556 patients with CKD from a prospective cohort study. The association between urinary kappa/creatinine (KCR) and lambda/creatinine (LCR) ratios and development of ESRD was assessed by competing-risks regression (to account for the competing risk of death). The change in C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement were used to assess the incremental value of adding KCR or LCR to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;136 participants developed ESRD during a median follow-up time of 51 months. Significant associations between KCR and LCR and risk of ESRD became non-significant after adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), although having a KCR or LCR &gt;75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centile remained independently associated with risk of ESRD. Neither KCR nor LCR as continuous or categorical variables provided incremental value when added to the KFRE for estimating risk of ESRD at two years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Urinary FLCs have an association with progression to ESRD in patients with CKD which appears to be explained to a degree by their correlation with eGFR and ACR.

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF &lt;i&gt;OCT4&lt;/i&gt;, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and to endodermal tumor formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types.</description><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rangarajan Sambathkumar, Renate Akkerman, Sumitava Dastidar, Philip Roelandt, Manoj Kumar, Manmohan Bajaj, Ana Rita Mestre Rosa, Nicky Helsen, Veerle Vanslembrouck, Eric Kalo, Satish Khurana, Jos Laureys, Conny Gysemans, Marijke M.

Wild peanut relatives (&lt;i&gt;Arachis&lt;/i&gt; spp.) are genetically diverse and were selected throughout evolution to a range of environments constituting, therefore, an important source of allelic diversity for abiotic stress tolerance. In particular, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stenosperma&lt;/i&gt;, the parents of the reference &lt;i&gt;Arachis&lt;/i&gt; A-genome genetic map, show contrasting transpiration behavior under limited water conditions. This study aimed to build a comprehensive gene expression profile of these two wild species under dehydration stress caused by the withdrawal of hydroponic nutrient solution. For this purpose, roots of both genotypes were collected at seven time-points during the early stages of dehydration and used to construct cDNA paired-end libraries. Physiological analyses indicated initial differences in gas exchange parameters between the drought-tolerant genotype of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and the drought-sensitive genotype of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stenosperma&lt;/i&gt;. High-quality Illumina reads were mapped against the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;duranensis&lt;/i&gt; reference genome and resulted in the identification of 1,235 and 799 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) that responded to the stress treatment in roots of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stenosperma&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. Further analysis, including functional annotation and identification of biological pathways represented by these DEGs confirmed the distinct gene expression behavior of the two contrasting &lt;i&gt;Arachis&lt;/i&gt; species genotypes under dehydration stress. Some species-exclusive and common DEGs were then selected for qRT-PCR analysis, which corroborated the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; expression profiling. These included genes coding for regulators and effectors involved in drought tolerance responses, such as activation of osmosensing molecular cascades, control of hormone and osmolyte content, and protection of macromolecules. This dataset of transcripts induced during the dehydration process in two wild &lt;i&gt;Arachis&lt;/i&gt; genotypes constitute new tools for the understanding of the distinct gene regulation processes in these closely related species but with contrasting drought responsiveness. In addition, our findings provide insights into the nature of drought tolerance in wild germoplasm, which might be explored as novel sources of diversity and useful wild alleles to develop climate-resilient crop varieties.</description><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christina Cleo Vinson, Ana Paula Zotta Mota, Thais Nicolini Oliveira, Larissa Arrais Guimaraes, Soraya Cristina Macedo Leal-Bertioli, Thomas Christopher Rhys Williams, Alexandre Lima Nepomuceno, Mario Alfredo Passos Saraiva, Ana Claudia Guerra Araujo, Patricia Messenberg Guimaraes, Ana C.

In addition, our findings provide insights into the nature of drought tolerance in wild germoplasm, which might be explored as novel sources of diversity and useful wild alleles to develop climate-resilient crop varieties.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527714000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198191</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198191</canonicalUrl><author><name>Christina Cleo Vinson</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb924:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>Ren Xu</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0020-z</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>287411e2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/-YVlG-UJFnw/s41591-018-0020-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Targeting skeletal endothelium to ameliorate bone loss</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0020-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Targeting skeletal endothelium to ameliorate bone loss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting skeletal endothelium to ameliorate bone loss, Published online: 21 May 2018;

Attempts to reduce this redundancy have focused on visualizing pathway overlap or merging pathways, but the resulting pathways may be of heterogeneous sizes and cover multiple biological functions. Efforts have also been made to deal with redundancy in pathway data by consolidating enriched pathways into a number of clusters or concepts. We present an alternative approach, which generates pathway subsets capable of covering all of genes presented within either pathway databases or enrichment results, generating substantial reductions in redundancy. Results: We propose a method that uses set cover to reduce pathway redundancy, without merging pathways. The proposed approach considers three objectives: removal of pathway redundancy, controlling pathway size and coverage of the gene set. By applying set cover to the ConsensusPathDB dataset we were able to produce a reduced set of pathways, representing 100% of the genes in the original data set with 74% less redundancy, or 95% of the genes with 88% less redundancy. We also developed an algorithm to simplify enrichment data and applied it to a set of enriched osteoarthritis pathways, revealing that within the top ten pathways, five were redundant subsets of more enriched pathways. Applying set cover to the enrichment results removed these redundant pathways allowing more informative pathways to take their place. Conclusion: Our method provides an alternative approach for handling pathway redundancy, while ensuring that the pathways are of homogeneous size and gene coverage is maximised. Pathways are not altered from their original form, allowing biological knowledge regarding the data set to be directly applicable. We demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to prioritise redundancy reduction, pathway size control or gene set coverage. The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.</description><crawled>1526078095893</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>Background: The consolidation of pathway databases, such as KEGG[1], Reactome[2]and ConsensusPathDB[3], has generated widespread biological interest, however the issue of pathway redundancy impedes the use of these consolidated datasets.

The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002912</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/k59-VYZP8r0/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Hey1- and p53-dependent TrkC proapoptotic activity controls neuroblastoma growth</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><crawled>1526060694416</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Ménard, Clélia Costechareyre, Gabriel Ichim, Jonathan Blachier, David Neves, Loraine Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Reinhard Depping, Jan Koster, Pierre Saintigny, Patrick Mehlen, Servane Tauszig-Delamasure&lt;/p&gt;

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a zinc-dependent protease associated with early immune responses to &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection, macrophage recruitment and granuloma formation. We evaluated whether adjunctive inhibition of MMP-9 could improve the response to standard TB treatment in a mouse model that develops necrotic lesions. Six weeks after an aerosol infection with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, C3HeB/FeJ mice received standard TB treatment (12 weeks) comprising rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide alone or in combination with either anti-MMP-9 antibody, etanercept (positive control) or isotype antibody (negative control) for 6 weeks. Anti-MMP-9 and the isotype control had comparable high serum exposures and expected terminal half-life. The relapse rate in mice receiving standard TB treatment was 46.6%. Compared to the standard TB treatment, relapse rates in animals that received adjunctive treatments with anti-MMP-9 antibody or etanercept were significantly decreased to 25.9% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) and 29.8% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019) respectively, but were not different from the arm that received the isotype control antibody (25.9%).

These data suggest that the relapse rates in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice may be non-specifically improved by administration of antibodies in conjunction with standard TB treatments.

Med. Chem. on “&lt;em&gt;What Makes a Great Medicinal Chemist&lt;/em&gt;“. As he makes clear from the beginning, if you’ve been doing this stuff for a while, you’ve likely heard many of these recommendations before. But it’s useful for people starting out, and it’s also useful for organization to think about what they’re encouraging (and what they’re not!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several characteristics common to good scientists in general – paraphrasing, we have: (1) intellectual curiosity, (2) ability to focus on the problem at hand, (3) pragmatic approach to problem-solving, (4) respect for data, (5) attention to detail, (6) sense of urgency, (7) awareness of other work in the field, (8) openness to new technologies (once they’ve proved their utility!), (9) willingness to challenge assumptions and ditch old ones, (10) enjoyment of their work, (11) awareness of the limits of their knowledge, (12) resiliency, (13) effective at communication, (14) working well with team members (there are exceptions!), (15) not constantly seeking credit, and (16) looking for mentors early on, and serving as one later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past that, he has traits that are more specific to medicinal chemists: (17) never losing sight of the final drug profile, (18) the ability to come up with unusual structural ideas when needed, (19) attention to more than just potency, (20) three-dimensional thinking, (21) awareness of the need for different chemical series/scaffolds, (22) awareness of the competition, but not being scared of IP space, (23) never giving on validated targets, since they’re rare, (24) a deep understanding of biology, (25) decisiveness about what the next steps in a project should be, (26) being unafraid of tough chemistry (in a good cause), (27) a willingness to repurpose anything (in a good cause), and (28) awareness of the history of the field and its current state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s quite a list! And it should be clear at the outset that you’re not going to find people – or not too many – who have all those qualities turned up to 11. But they’re all useful and important, and it’s worth looking over them to see what your strengths are (and especially what you might need to shore up a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few comments on specific items: I think that (3), (9), and (27) are aspects of the same approach to applied research – that is, a willingness to go with what works, even if it isn’t your idea, even if it disproves your favorite assumptions, even if it seems weird or even if it seems obvious or old. Things that work, that really work, are the ace cards in the deck. Solid experimental evidence brushes aside feelings, theories, and assumptions (quality 4 above ), and you have to be ready to come to terms with it and figure out where it’s telling you to go next (quality 25). A corollary is that if you’re running experiments whose results are not going to be solid or important enough for you to base such decisions on, then why? We’ve all sat in meetings where someone outlines an experiment that (if it works) means the project goes on as planned. But if it doesn’t work? Then. . .the project goes on as planned anyway. It’s hard to see how that’s not, at some level, a waste of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also has a connection with (11), knowing what you don’t know. There are mistakes at both ends of the scale (there always are), and in this case it’s being too tentative or being too confident. Chemists, in my experience, are more prone to the latter, the mistake the Greeks called &lt;em&gt;hubris&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone who’s honest with themselves about biomedical research has to admit that most of the time, about most things, we can only aspire to the level of actually knowing jack diddley. What really causes Alzheimer’s? What are the specific neuronal processes involved in consciousness? What’s the specific molecular process you’d need to hit to stop multiple sclerosis or lupus? On a more immediate level, why does Compound Series A get into cells while Compound Series B doesn’t? What do I need to do to the lead compound to make it about two times more potent at the target? Or about ten times less potent at that other target it’s hitting? What other targets is the thing hitting, anyway? And so on. Decision-making under these conditions is. . .nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why many of the desirable qualities above can in fact work against each other, if taken to extremes or misapplied. Attention to detail is important – but not to the point where you become unable to make a call because you can think of bad consequences every way you turn. Ability to focus is important, but not if it leads to glossing over key experimental data that are trying to tell you something. Mistakes at both ends of the scale!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(24), understanding of biology, deserves some comment. My feeling is that not many people from other fields tend to know much about organic or medicinal chemistry, nor do they seem particularly eager to learn. So we chemists have a real advantage, knowing this stuff already, but you can’t rest on that advantage, either. The point is to start from there and &lt;em&gt;go learn about the other stuff&lt;/em&gt;. You can be useful as a chemist (at an entry-level position) without knowing much about the biology involved – just bang out compounds. But you cannot be really good at the job with that approach, nor (as time goes on) will you continue to be as valuable to your employer – or any other employer. The chemistry is just a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quality worth noting is (12), resilience. A constant feature of drug research is that most things, most of the time, don’t work that well. Your ideas about improving the compounds? By golly, here come the assay data, and it’s back to the bench we go. You have to be ready for your best ideas, your biggest bolts of inspiration, to land in a tangled heap over and over. It takes getting used to, and some personality types are just not suited to it. Longterm med-chemists exhibit survivorship bias; they’re the ones who have been able to deal, but not everyone can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been focusing on individual behavior, but as mentioned above, there’s something to be said about organizations, too. Managers of all types should think about whether their labs, departments, or companies are providing a good home for these behaviors or not. Be honest. I’m not talking about wall posters, e-mail newsletters, or “State of the Company” speeches. Your mission statement might say that you’re committed to innovation or something, but talk is as cheap as it’s ever been. For employees looking at their own management, my advice is always this: don’t pay so much attention to what they say, but rather &lt;em&gt;watch what they do&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t read the slogans on the intranet pages – pay attention and &lt;em&gt;watch what behaviors your company actually rewards&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they’re valuing the sorts of things on Murcko’s list, that’s good news. But if they’re not, they may be rewarding some less worthwhile behaviors, like delivering on deadline even if it means delivering crap, whacking people on the head for coming up with inconvenient data or ideas, advancing projects based more on who proposed them than intrinsic merit, etc. There’s a whole Devil’s Dictionary/Screwtape Letters list of things that good medicinal chemists and scientists &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; do, and you need to be alert to their presence, too. The devil finds work for idle hands, and for empty heads, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526995410000</published><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13550</link><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/22/how-to-be-a-good-medicinal-chemist</canonicalUrl><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_163880cae30:6b47063:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00157/20180523/images/medium/cb-2018-00157n_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00157&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Honey from the European honeybee, &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;, is produced by α-glucosidases (HBGases) and is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Categorized by their substrate specificities, HBGases have three isoforms: HBGase I, II and III. Previous experimental investigations showed that wild-type HBGase III from &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt; (WT) preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while the Y227H mutant (MT) preferred maltose to sucrose. This mutant can potentially be used for malt hydrolysis because it can efficiently hydrolyze maltose. In this work, to elucidate important factors contributing to substrate specificity of this enzyme and gain insight into how the Y227H mutation causes substrate specificity change, WT and MT homology models were constructed, and sucrose/maltose was docked into active sites of the WT and MT. AMBER14 was employed to perform three independent molecular dynamics runs for these four complexes. Based on the relative binding free energies calculated by the MM-GBSA method, sucrose is better than maltose for WT binding, while maltose is better than sucrose for MT binding. These rankings support the experimentally observed substrate specificity that WT preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while MT preferred maltose to sucrose, suggesting the importance of binding affinity for substrate specificity. We also found that the Y227H mutation caused changes in the proximities between the atoms necessary for sucrose/maltose hydrolysis that may affect enzyme efficiency in the hydrolysis of sucrose/maltose.

Honey from the European honeybee, &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;, is produced by α-glucosidases (HBGases) and is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Categorized by their substrate specificities, HBGases have three isoforms: HBGase I, II and III. Previous experimental investigations showed that wild-type HBGase III from &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt; (WT) preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while the Y227H mutant (MT) preferred maltose to sucrose. This mutant can potentially be used for malt hydrolysis because it can efficiently hydrolyze maltose. In this work, to elucidate important factors contributing to substrate specificity of this enzyme and gain insight into how the Y227H mutation causes substrate specificity change, WT and MT homology models were constructed, and sucrose/maltose was docked into active sites of the WT and MT. AMBER14 was employed to perform three independent molecular dynamics runs for these four complexes. Based on the relative binding free energies calculated by the MM-GBSA method, sucrose is better than maltose for WT binding, while maltose is better than sucrose for MT binding. These rankings support the experimentally observed substrate specificity that WT preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while MT preferred maltose to sucrose, suggesting the importance of binding affinity for substrate specificity. We also found that the Y227H mutation caused changes in the proximities between the atoms necessary for sucrose/maltose hydrolysis that may affect enzyme efficiency in the hydrolysis of sucrose/maltose. Moreover, the per-residue binding free energy decomposition results show that Y227/H227 may be a key residue for preference binding of sucrose/maltose in the WT/MT active site. Our study provides important and novel insight into the binding of sucrose/maltose in the active site of &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt; HBGase III and into how the Y227H mutation leads to the substrate specificity change at the molecular level. This knowledge could be beneficial in the design of this enzyme for increased production of desired products.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528146000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198484</link><unread>True</unread><author><name>Pratchaya Pramoj Na Ayutthaya</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b78f:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197217</originId><updated>1526331600000</updated><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>10b8e987</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197217</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>The genetic component of preeclampsia: A whole-exome sequencing study</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anette Tarp Hansen, Jens Magnus Bernth Jensen, Anne-Mette Hvas, Mette Christiansen&lt;/p&gt;
Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal deaths. The aetiology of preeclampsia is largely unknown but a polygenetic component is assumed. To explore this hypothesis, we performed an in-depth whole-exome sequencing study in women with (cases, N = 50) and without (controls, N = 50) preeclampsia. The women were identified in an unselected cohort of 2,545 pregnant women based on data from the Danish National Patient Registry and the Medical Birth Registry. Matching DNA was obtained from a biobank containing excess blood from routine antenatal care visits. Novogene performed the whole-exome sequencing blinded to preeclampsia status. Variants for comparison between cases and controls were filtered in the Ingenuity Variant Analysis software. We applied two different strategies; a &lt;i&gt;disease association panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included variants in single genes associated with established clinical risk factors for preeclampsia, and a &lt;i&gt;gene panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included biological pathways harbouring genes previously reported to be associated with preeclampsia. Variant variability was compared in cases and controls at the level of biological processes, signalling pathways, and in single genes. Regardless of the applied strategy and the level of variability examined, we consistently found positive correlations between variant numbers in cases and controls (all R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s&gt;0.88). Contrary to what was expected, cases carried fewer variants in biological processes and signalling pathways than controls (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-values ≤0.02). In conclusion, our findings challenge the hypothesis of a polygenetic aetiology for preeclampsia with a common network of susceptibility genes. The greater genetic diversity among controls may suggest a protective role of genetic diversity against the development of preeclampsia.</description><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anette Tarp Hansen, Jens Magnus Bernth Jensen, Anne-Mette Hvas, Mette Christiansen&lt;/p&gt;

People who have been advocating this for years will now get a chance to see how it works out in practice – and in fact, I would encourage them to go ahead and put down some predictions about what they think might happen. Predicting that not much will change, or that it will be hard to notice the effects, etc., is not (to my mind) a particularly good answer for supporters of this approach, because one then wonders why it was worth going to the trouble at all. But I’m not a supporter, so that’s my prediction: little change, with potential for harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/06/10/right_to_try_here_we_go&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/06/20/stem_cells_the_center_of_right_to_try&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt; many times before, but in case my views aren’t clear, here we go: I think Right to Try laws are largely useless, and have the potential to cause actual harm disproportionate to the good they might do. I think that there are sincere, principled advocates for them, but at the same time, there are many people on that side of the issue who are either ill-informed about medical research or who are simply grandstanding for votes and popular support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, my biggest reasons for thinking this way are: (1) most investigational drugs don’t work. The failure rate in human clinical trials is around 90 per cent, and it’s been that way for a long time. (2) there are disease areas where a tragedy-of-the-commons situation will mean that controlled clinical trials (which are still the only way to determine if a new drug works) will be much more difficult to run under a “why wait for proof?” system (I have to note that the current bill restricts right-to-try to those patients who are ineligible for clinical trials, which is a good provision). (3) opening up unproven therapies could lead to a moral hazard, where it becomes lucrative to put useless-but-harmless “drug candidates” into “clinical trials” so you can charge desperate patients at “cost”. I mean every quotation mark in that last sentence. I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-05-24/right-to-try-drug-law-risks-exploiting-desperate-patients&quot;&gt;not the only person&lt;/a&gt; who thinks this way. My own suggestion for the last point has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dereklowe/status/826761000032600064&quot;&gt;already been made&lt;/a&gt;: antioxidant phytonutrients – i.e., dried grape juice pills – for Alzheimer’s. Won’t do a thing, but hey, you have the right to try ’em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/372440-hundreds-sign-on-to-letter-opposing-right-to-try-drug-bill&quot;&gt;empirical evidence&lt;/a&gt; for all of these positions. Many states have passed their own right-to-try laws (in various forms), and if there has been any decrease in human suffering or advance in medical knowledge through them, I have missed it. To get specific, when Colorado passed its own law in 2014, one of the first companies that announced plans to offer treatments under its provisions was a stem-cell company, Neuralstem. And guess what? None of their treatments &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4094360-neuralstem-doomed&quot;&gt;ever worked&lt;/a&gt;. Most things don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, I’m inclined to put this current legislation in the “grandstanding” category. That’s because, as I understand it, there are no provisions that any given company has to provide such an experimental drug for use. It might be better named “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/right-to-try-bill-passes-trump-to-sign-will-it-help-terminally-ill-patients/&quot;&gt;right to ask&lt;/a&gt;“, and the compassionate-use program already provides just that. What’s changed? Well, now that we have a brand new federal law, all sorts of politicians will be able to talk about how they brought lifesaving therapies directly to critically ill patients, shook up the horrible drug approval process, struck a blow for the common people and stuck it to the drug companies, and on and on. Not always a very instructive spectacle, politics. Scott Gottlieb &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/05/24/614105544/right-to-try-act-poses-big-challenge-for-fda&quot;&gt;now gets to implement&lt;/a&gt; this law, and good luck to him.&lt;/p&gt;

The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, have been used as lipid lowering drugs for decades and several epidemiological studies suggest statin usage correlates with a decreased incidence of cancer specific mortality in patients. However, the mechanism of this mortality benefit remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that statin drug lipophilicity and affinity for its target enzyme, HMGCR, determine their growth suppressive potency against various tumor cell lines. The lipophilic atorvastatin decreases cancer cell proliferation and survival &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Statin sensitivity coincided with Ras localization to the cytosol instead of the membrane, consistent with a decrement in prenylation. To investigate signaling pathways that may be involved with sensitivity to statin therapy, we employed inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt and Mek-Erk signaling cascades. We found that inhibition of PI3K signaling through Akt potentiated statin sensitivity of breast cancer cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in co-culture with primary human hepatocytes. The same effect was not observed with inhibition of Mek signaling through Erk. Moreover, the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to atorvastatin-mediated growth suppression correlated with a decrease in EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. As an increase in Akt activity has been shown to be involved in the metastasis and metastatic outgrowth of many cancer types (including breast), these data suggest a mechanism by which statins may reduce cancer specific mortality in patients.</description><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Colin H.

The questions about the origin and the main factor responsible for the present structure of the code are still under a hot debate. Various methodologies have been used to study the features of the code and assess the level of its potential optimality. Here, we introduced a new general approach to evaluate the quality of the genetic code structure. This methodology comes from graph theory and allows us to describe new properties of the genetic code in terms of conductance. This parameter measures the robustness of codon groups against the potential changes in translation of the protein-coding sequences generated by single nucleotide substitutions. We described the genetic code as a partition of an undirected and unweighted graph, which makes the model general and universal. Using this approach, we showed that the structure of the genetic code is a solution to the graph clustering problem. We presented and discussed the structure of the codes that are optimal according to the conductance. Despite the fact that the standard genetic code is far from being optimal according to the conductance, its structure is characterised by many codon groups reaching the minimum conductance for their size. The SGC represents most likely a local minimum in terms of errors occurring in protein-coding sequences and their translation.</description><crawled>1527521874677</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>The standard genetic code (SGC) is the set of rules by which genetic information is translated into proteins, from codons, i.e. triplets of nucleotides, to amino acids.

Here, we introduced a new general approach to evaluate the quality of the genetic code structure. This methodology comes from graph theory and allows us to describe new properties of the genetic code in terms of conductance. This parameter measures the robustness of codon groups against the potential changes in translation of the protein-coding sequences generated by single nucleotide substitutions. We described the genetic code as a partition of an undirected and unweighted graph, which makes the model general and universal. Using this approach, we showed that the structure of the genetic code is a solution to the graph clustering problem. We presented and discussed the structure of the codes that are optimal according to the conductance. Despite the fact that the standard genetic code is far from being optimal according to the conductance, its structure is characterised by many codon groups reaching the minimum conductance for their size. The SGC represents most likely a local minimum in terms of errors occurring in protein-coding sequences and their translation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527490800000</published><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/28/332478</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163a76612f5:187932b:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><author><name>Nathalie Tarrat</name></author><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021785?af=R</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>e9379a9c</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021785?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Au147 nanoparticles: Ordered or amorphous?</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021785?af=R</link><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><crawled>1527837712785</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/20&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 20&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527748243000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163ba396191:3560d4b:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198486</originId><updated>1528146000000</updated><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shang-Yi Lin, Hung-Pin Tu, Tun-Chieh Chen, Mei-Chiou Shen, Yi-Wen Chiu, Yen-Hsu Chen, Po-Liang Lu&lt;/p&gt;
Objectives &lt;p&gt;Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) infections in the hemodialysis (HD) population are epidemiologically classified as healthcare-associated infections.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of exercise training with modest or greater weight loss (≥3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) on insulin sensitivity, lipoprotein concentrations, and lipoprotein particle size in overweight and obese participants.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Adults (N = 163, body mass index: 25–37 [kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]) participated in 8 months of exercise training. Insulin sensitivity, lipid concentrations, lipid particle size and other cardiometabolic variables were measured at baseline and follow-up. Participants were categorized by whether they achieved at least modest weight loss (≥ 3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) following the intervention.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A greater improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in adults performing exercise training with at least modest weight loss (2.2 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 1.5 to 2.8) compared to those who did not (0.8 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 0.5 to 1.2). Similar results were observed for acute insulin response, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol concentration, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size (p&amp;lt;0.05), when all exercise groups were combined. No significant results across weight loss categories were observed for LDL, HDL, glucose, or insulin levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The present study suggests that aerobic exercise combined with at least modest weight loss leads to greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, triglycerides as well as other non-traditional lipid risk factors (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL/LDL particle size).

However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change, favorably or unfavorably, if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is often limited because these complex relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality and morbidity. Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal networks. Unlike approaches limited to predicting simple drug-drug interaction values, Decagon can predict the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well polypharmacy side effects that have a strong molecular basis, while on predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon opens up opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient population data to flag and prioritize polypharmacy side effects for follow-up analysis via formal pharmacological studies.</description><crawled>1526665534065</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common to treat patients with complex diseases or co-existing conditions.

In particular, we demonstrate that substituting the Siren regression model in place of the existing peak-calling step in DIA-Umpire leads to improved overall rates of peptide detection.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527145200000</published><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/24/329805</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163933f978b:800bece:93d646dc</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</originId><updated>1526504400000</updated><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>2af529db</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Pollen analysis of Australian honey</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Pollen analysis is widely used to verify the geographic origin of honeys, but has never been employed in Australia. In this study, we analysed the pollen content of 173 unblended honey samples sourced from most of the commercial honey producing regions in southern Australia. Southern Australian vegetation is dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; (Myrtaceae) forests and, as expected, most Australian honeys are palynologically dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt;, while other important components include Myrtaceae taxa such as &lt;i&gt;Corymbia&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Angophora&lt;/i&gt; and the tribe Leptospermeae; plus Brassicaceae, &lt;i&gt;Echium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Macadamia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acacia&lt;/i&gt;. An important feature of the honeys is the number of Myrtaceae pollen morphotypes per sample, which is generally high (mean = 4.6) compared to honeys produced outside of Australia, including &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys produced in the Mediterranean region, and honeys produced in South America, which has its own rich indigenous Myrtaceae flora. In the latter regions, the number of Myrtaceae morphotypes is apparently generally ≤2. A high number of Myrtaceae morphotypes may be a feasible criterion for authenticating the origin of Australian honeys, since most Australian honey is produced by honey bees mainly working indigenous floral resources. Myrtaceae morphotype diversity is a convenient melissopalynological measure that could be applied even where detailed knowledge of the pollen morphology of the many component genera and species is absent. Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey.</description><crawled>1526493611198</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Cutting-edge high-dimensional analysis methods are successful in characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but they suffer from the &apos;curse of dimensionality&apos; and non-standardized outputs.

Conclusions: We apply RefCell to the analysis of data from a high-throughput imaging screen of a library of 320 ubiquitin protein targeted siRNAs selected to gain insights into the mechanisms of premature aging (progeria). We compare RefCell results to a clustering based single cell analysis methods as well as conventional average based results. RefCell is able to identify similar results as the other two methods.

When used to segment cells or intracellular organelles, several current deep learning techniques outperform traditional image processing algorithms. However, segmentation algorithms still have unsolved problems, especially in bioimage processing. The most critical issue is that the existing deep learning-based algorithms for bioimages can perform only semantic segmentation, which distinguishes whether a pixel is within an object (for example, nucleus) or not. In this study, we implemented a novel segmentation algorithm, based on deep learning, which segments each nucleus and adds different labels to the detected objects. This segmentation algorithm is called instance segmentation. Our instance segmentation algorithm, implemented as a neural network, which we named QCA Net, substantially outperformed 3D U-Net, which is the best semantic segmentation algorithm that uses deep learning. Using QCA Net, we quantified the nuclear number, volume, surface area, and center of gravity coordinates during the development of mouse embryos. In particular, QCA Net distinguished nuclei of embryonic cells from those of polar bodies formed in meiosis.

In this study, we analyzed the in vitro effects of Casiopeina II-gly on the expression of canonical biological pathways. Using microarray data from HeLa cell lines treated with Casiopeina II-gly, we identified biological pathways that are perturbed after treatment. We present a novel approach integrating pathway analysis and network theory: The Pathway Crosstalk Network. We constructed a network with deregulated pathways, featuring links between those pathways that crosstalk with each other. We identified modules grouping deregulated pathways that are functionally related. Through this approach, we were able to identify three features of Casiopeina treatment: a) Perturbation of signaling pathways, related to induction of apoptosis; b) perturbation of metabolic pathways, and c) activation of immune responses.

Under nitrogen deprivation, the one-dimensional cyanobacterial organism &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt; sp. PCC 7120 develops patterns of single, nitrogen-fixing cells separated by nearly regular intervals of photosynthetic vegetative cells. We study a minimal, stochastic model of developmental patterns in &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt; that includes a nondiffusing activator, two diffusing inhibitor morphogens, demographic fluctuations in the number of morphogen molecules, and filament growth. By tracking developing filaments, we provide experimental evidence for different spatiotemporal roles of the two inhibitors during pattern maintenance and for small molecular copy numbers, justifying a stochastic approach. In the deterministic limit, the model yields Turing patterns within a region of parameter space that shrinks markedly as the inhibitor diffusivities become equal. Transient, noise-driven, stochastic Turing patterns are produced outside this region, which can then be fixed by downstream genetic commitment pathways, dramatically enhancing the robustness of pattern formation, also in the biologically relevant situation in which the inhibitors&apos; diffusivities may be comparable.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YCarz8vRFKU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004877</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/YCarz8vRFKU/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Robust stochastic Turing patterns in the development of a one-dimensional cyanobacterial organism</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><crawled>1525455751998</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francesca Di Patti, Laura Lavacchi, Rinat Arbel-Goren, Leora Schein-Lubomirsky, Duccio Fanelli, Joel Stavans&lt;/p&gt;

Chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is an inflammatory and neuropathic pain disorder characterized by the involvement of the autonomic nervous system with sensory, autonomic, motor, skin, and bone changes. At present, universally accepted consensus criteria for CRPS are not yet established, despite the diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). Various hypotheses for the pathophysiology of CRPS have been proposed; as a result, current therapeutic modalities are varied. General epidemiological data on CRPS are necessary for effective management. However, recent data on the epidemiology of CRPS in Korea are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and other epidemiological features of CRPS in the general population in Korea. In this study on the epidemiology of CRPS in Korea, population-based medical data acquired from 51,448,491 subscribers to the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) from 2011 to 2015 were analyzed, including the incidence, distribution by the CRPS type, regional distribution, monthly distribution, medical costs, and healthcare resource-utilization. The findings indicated that the incidence of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years in 2015 and was correlated with patient age and sex. CRPS types included type I (63%) and type II (37%); moreover, the number of individuals with CRPS I have shown a growing trend since 2011. There was no monthly distribution, but there was regional variation according to the province. The medical departments managing CRPS I the most were orthopedics, internal medicine, anesthesiology and pain medicine, in order; however, patients with CRPS spent more money per visit in the departments of rehabilitation medicine, and anesthesiology and pain medicine. The incidence rate of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years with an increasing trend, which was correlated with patient age in the 70s and female sex. CRPS type I was more common than CRPS type II; in addition, constant increase in medical expenses, regional imbalance, and differences in medical expense among medical specialties should be considered for early management of patients to reduce the disease burden in Korea. Sharing of knowledge about the diagnostic criteria of CRPS are also needed.</description><fingerprint>b0f9d0ed</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198147</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Epidemiology of complex regional pain syndrome in Korea: An electronic population health data study</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyungtae Kim, Cheol-Hyeong Lee, Sung-Hun Kim, Yeon-Dong Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), particularly pathologic complete response (pCR), is an independent predictor of favorable clinical outcome in breast cancer (BC). The accuracy of residual disease measurement and reporting is of critical importance in treatment planning and prognosis for these patients. Currently, gross pathological evaluation of the residual tumor bed is the greatest determinant for accurate reporting of NACT response. Fluorescence imaging (FI) is a new technology that is being evaluated for use in the detection of tumors in different oncological conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate whether indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) is able to detect residual breast tumor tissue after NACT in breast surgical operative specimens.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients who underwent NACT for BC and were admitted for breast surgery were selected for participation in this study. Free ICG (0.25 mg/kg) was injected intraoperatively. Tumor-to-background fluorescence ratio (TBFR) was calculated on ex vivo samples from the surgical specimen.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and seventy-two samples from nine breast surgical specimens were evaluated for their fluorescence intensity.

Background &lt;p&gt;Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), particularly pathologic complete response (pCR), is an independent predictor of favorable clinical outcome in breast cancer (BC). The accuracy of residual disease measurement and reporting is of critical importance in treatment planning and prognosis for these patients. Currently, gross pathological evaluation of the residual tumor bed is the greatest determinant for accurate reporting of NACT response. Fluorescence imaging (FI) is a new technology that is being evaluated for use in the detection of tumors in different oncological conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate whether indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) is able to detect residual breast tumor tissue after NACT in breast surgical operative specimens.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients who underwent NACT for BC and were admitted for breast surgery were selected for participation in this study. Free ICG (0.25 mg/kg) was injected intraoperatively. Tumor-to-background fluorescence ratio (TBFR) was calculated on ex vivo samples from the surgical specimen.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and seventy-two samples from nine breast surgical specimens were evaluated for their fluorescence intensity. Among them, 52 were malignant (30.2%) and 120 were benign (69.8%). The mean TBFR was 3.3 (SD 1.68) in malignant samples and 1.9 (SD 0.97) in benign samples (p = 0.0002). With a TBFR cut-off value of 1.3, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, false negative rate, and false positive rate of ICG-FI to predict residual tumoral disease in breast surgical samples post-NACT were 94.2%, 31.7%, 92.7%, 5.8%, and 68.3%, respectively. If we restricted our analysis to only patients who achieved pCR, the negative predictive value for ICG-FI was 100%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These first observations indicate that ex vivo ICG-FI is sensitive but not sufficiently specific to discriminate between benign breast tissue and malignant residual tissue. Nevertheless, its negative predictive value seems sufficiently accurate to exclude the presence of residual breast tumor tissue on the operative specimen of patients treated by NACT, representing a potential tool to assist pathologists in the assessment of breast surgical specimens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527282000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197857</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197857</canonicalUrl><author><name>Isabelle Veys</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd79:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Hazarika, R.</name></author><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335687v1?rss=1</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>180933e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335687v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Large-scale docking predicts that sORF-encoded peptides may function through protein-peptide interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335687v1?rss=1</link><description>Several recent studies indicate that small Open Reading Frames (sORFs) embedded within multiple eukaryotic non-coding RNAs can be translated into bioactive peptides of up to 100 amino acids in size. However, the functional roles of the 607 Stress Induced Peptides (SIPs) previously identified from 189 Transcriptionally Active Regions (TARs) in Arabidopsis thaliana remain unclear. To provide a starting point for function annotation of these peptides, we performed a large-scale prediction of peptide binding sites on protein surfaces using and coarse-grained peptide docking. The docked models were subjected to further atomistic refinement and binding energy calculations. A total of 530 peptide-protein pairs were successfully docked. In cases where a peptide encoded by a TAR is predicted to bind at a known ligand or cofactor-binding site within the protein, it can be assumed that the peptide modulates the ligand or cofactor-binding. Moreover, we predict that several peptides bind at protein-protein interfaces, which could therefore regulate the formation of the respective complexes. Protein-peptide binding analysis further revealed that peptides employ both their backbone and side chain atoms when binding to the protein, forming predominantly hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. In this study, we have generated novel predictions on the potential protein-peptide interactions in A. thaliana, which will help in further experimental validation.</description><crawled>1527776111833</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>Several recent studies indicate that small Open Reading Frames (sORFs) embedded within multiple eukaryotic non-coding RNAs can be translated into bioactive peptides of up to 100 amino acids in size.

[NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/320846v1?rss=1</link><description>Although natural language processing (NLP) tools have been available in English for quite some time, it is not the case for many other languages, particularly for context specific texts like clinical notes. This poses a challenge for tasks like text classification in languages other than English. In the absence of basic NLP tools, manually engineering features that capture semantic information of the documents is a potential solution. Nevertheless, it is very time consuming. Deep neural networks, particularly deep recurrent neural networks (RNN), have been proposed as End-to-End models that learn both features and parameters jointly, thus avoiding the need to manually encode the features. We compared the performance of two classifiers for labeling 14718 clinical notes in Spanish according to the patients&apos; smoking status: a bag-of-words model involving heavy manual feature engineering and a bidirectional long-short-term-memory (LSTM) deep recurrent neural network (RNN) with GloVe word embeddings. The RNN slightly outperforms the bag-of-words model, but with 80% less overall development time. Such algorithms can facilitate the exploitation of clinical notes in languages in which NLP tools are not as developed as in English.</description><crawled>1526271251123</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>Although natural language processing (NLP) tools have been available in English for quite some time, it is not the case for many other languages, particularly for context specific texts like clinical notes.

Although performance feedback is widely employed as a means to improve motivation, the efficacy and reliability of performance feedback is often obscured by individual differences and situational variables. The joint role of these moderating variables remains unknown. Accordingly, we investigate how the motivational impact of feedback is moderated by personality and task-difficulty. Utilizing three samples (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 916), we explore how Big Five personality traits moderate the motivational impact of false positive and negative feedback on playful, neutral, and frustrating puzzle tasks, respectively. Conscientious and Neurotic individuals together appear particularly sensitive to task difficulty, becoming significantly more motivated by negative feedback on playful tasks and demotivated by negative feedback on frustrating tasks. Results are discussed in terms of Goal-Setting and Self Determination Theory. Implications for industry and education are considered.</description><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Victor Swift, Jordan B.

The SVR12 rates in the patients with IFN-free treatment-naïve and retreatment were 97.6% and 80.6%, respectively. HCV elimination was not achieved in 17 patients, 11 (including 5 with IFN-free retreatment) of whom had virologic failure. Eight patients had coexisting NS5A RASs of Q24, L28 and/or R30, L31, or Y93 and one patient had coexisting NS5A RASs of P32L and A92K. Interestingly, 10 and 8 patients had NS5B A218S and C316N RAS respectively. According to a multivariate analysis, coexisting NS5A RASs, NS5A P32 RAS, NS5B A218 and/or C316 RASs, and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase were associated with virologic failure. In the naïve patients, all patients without NS5B A218 and/or C316 RAS achieved an SVR12.

Huntington’s disease (HD) age of onset (AO) is mainly determined by the length of the CAG repeat expansion in the &lt;i&gt;huntingtin&lt;/i&gt; gene. The remaining AO variability has been attributed to other little-known factors. A factor that has been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases is arterial hypertension (AHT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of AHT to the AO of HD. We used data from a cohort of 630 European HD patients with adult onset collected by the REGISTRY project of the European Huntington’s Disease Network. Multiple linear regression and ANOVA, controlling for the CAG repeat number of the expanded allele (CAGexp) of each patient, were performed to assess the association between the AHT condition and the AO of the motor symptoms (mAO). The results showed a significant association between AHT and mAO, especially when we only considered the patients diagnosed with AHT prior to manifesting any HD signs (pre-HD AHT). Remarkably, despite the low number of cases, those patients developed motor symptoms 5–8 years later than normotensive patients in the most frequent CAGexp range (40–44). AHT is an age-related condition and consequently, the age of the patient at the time of data collection could be a confounder variable.

Huntington’s disease (HD) age of onset (AO) is mainly determined by the length of the CAG repeat expansion in the &lt;i&gt;huntingtin&lt;/i&gt; gene. The remaining AO variability has been attributed to other little-known factors. A factor that has been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases is arterial hypertension (AHT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of AHT to the AO of HD. We used data from a cohort of 630 European HD patients with adult onset collected by the REGISTRY project of the European Huntington’s Disease Network. Multiple linear regression and ANOVA, controlling for the CAG repeat number of the expanded allele (CAGexp) of each patient, were performed to assess the association between the AHT condition and the AO of the motor symptoms (mAO). The results showed a significant association between AHT and mAO, especially when we only considered the patients diagnosed with AHT prior to manifesting any HD signs (pre-HD AHT). Remarkably, despite the low number of cases, those patients developed motor symptoms 5–8 years later than normotensive patients in the most frequent CAGexp range (40–44). AHT is an age-related condition and consequently, the age of the patient at the time of data collection could be a confounder variable. However, given that most pre-HD AHT patients included in our study had started treatment with antihypertensive drugs prior to the onset of HD, and that antihypertensive drugs have been suggested to confer a neuroprotective effect in other neurodegenerative diseases, raises the interest in elucidating the impact of AHT and/or AHT treatment in HD age of onset in further studies. A confirmation of our results in a larger sample set would open the possibility to significantly improve HD management.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527109200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197975</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197975</canonicalUrl><author><name>Leire Valcárcel-Ocete</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2343:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>Vinson, V.</name></author><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-f?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>79c46d1d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-f?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Dynamic fibrils drive protein assembly</title><unread>True</unread><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1525974002000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-f?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/616.6.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7ca:93d646dc</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Michele Torella</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26528-9</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low-dose anticoagulation after isolated mechanical aortic valve replacement with Liva Nova Bicarbon prosthesis: A post hoc analysis of LOWERING-IT Trial&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-dose anticoagulation after isolated mechanical aortic valve replacement with Liva Nova Bicarbon prosthesis: A post hoc analysis of LOWERING-IT Trial, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26528-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26528-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Low-dose anticoagulation after isolated mechanical aortic valve replacement with Liva Nova Bicarbon prosthesis: A post hoc analysis of LOWERING-IT Trial&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vRvTnBlYeCY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>5af8cb37</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/vRvTnBlYeCY/s41598-018-26528-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Low-dose anticoagulation after isolated mechanical aortic valve replacement with Liva Nova Bicarbon prosthesis: A post hoc analysis of LOWERING-IT Trial</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26528-9</link><crawled>1527671824101</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low-dose anticoagulation after isolated mechanical aortic valve replacement with Liva Nova Bicarbon prosthesis: A post hoc analysis of LOWERING-IT Trial&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-dose anticoagulation after isolated mechanical aortic valve replacement with Liva Nova Bicarbon prosthesis: A post hoc analysis of LOWERING-IT Trial, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26528-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26528-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Low-dose anticoagulation after isolated mechanical aortic valve replacement with Liva Nova Bicarbon prosthesis: A post hoc analysis of LOWERING-IT Trial&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vRvTnBlYeCY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527663600000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26528-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163b0561ee5:256d7e6:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Yangjin Kim, Ji Young Yoo, Tae Jin Lee, Joseph Liu, Jianhua Yu, Michael A.

The degradation of natural wetlands has significant effects on the ecosystem services they provide and the biodiversity they sustain. Under certain conditions, these negative effects can be mitigated by the presence of artificial wetlands. However, the conservation value of artificial wetlands needs to be explored further. In addition, it is unclear how certain anthropogenic variables, such as road networks and hunting reserves (i.e., areas where hunting of birds is prohibited) affect biodiversity in both artificial and natural wetlands. Here, we use data from thirteen artificial and six natural wetlands in Cyprus, to assess their similarities in bird species diversity and composition, and to quantify the relationship between species diversity and the density of road networks, hunting reserves, wetland size, and wetland depth. We found that while on average natural wetlands have more species and support higher abundances, certain artificial wetlands have the potential to support similarly diverse communities.

The degradation of natural wetlands has significant effects on the ecosystem services they provide and the biodiversity they sustain. Under certain conditions, these negative effects can be mitigated by the presence of artificial wetlands. However, the conservation value of artificial wetlands needs to be explored further. In addition, it is unclear how certain anthropogenic variables, such as road networks and hunting reserves (i.e., areas where hunting of birds is prohibited) affect biodiversity in both artificial and natural wetlands. Here, we use data from thirteen artificial and six natural wetlands in Cyprus, to assess their similarities in bird species diversity and composition, and to quantify the relationship between species diversity and the density of road networks, hunting reserves, wetland size, and wetland depth. We found that while on average natural wetlands have more species and support higher abundances, certain artificial wetlands have the potential to support similarly diverse communities. Overall, regardless of the type, larger wetlands, with shallower waters tend to be more biodiverse. The same is true for wetlands surrounded by a higher percentage of hunting reserves and a lower density of road networks, albeit the effect of road networks was weaker. We conclude, from our results, that although the conservation value of natural wetlands is higher, artificial wetlands have the potential to play a complimentary role in the conservation of bird communities, assuming those wetlands have the right characteristics (e.g., in terms of size and depth) and assuming that the disturbances resulting from high-impact human-activities (e.g., hunting) are minimized.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</canonicalUrl><author><name>Efthymia Giosa</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0e9:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>21</engagement><keywords><item>Epidemiology, Medicine, Diseases, Virology</item></keywords><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/844?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/844.full</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>c2a23902</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/844?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>A call to arms against the other retrovirus</title><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1527183688000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/844?rss=1</link><author><name>Kupferschmidt, K.</name></author><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce966:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>237</engagement><author><name>David Norris</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05146-5</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>1724ea67</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05146-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Health tips for research groups</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05146-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Health tips for research groups&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health tips for research groups, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05146-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05146-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Nature asked scientists to recommend one thing that institutional and laboratory leaders could do to make science more productive, rigorous and happy.</description><crawled>1526465755701</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Health tips for research groups&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health tips for research groups, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05146-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05146-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Nature asked scientists to recommend one thing that institutional and laboratory leaders could do to make science more productive, rigorous and happy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526454000000</published><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05146-5/d41586-018-05146-5_15756564.jpg</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1636872fa35:40b025b:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Peng-Lu Pan, Yu-Xuan Ye, Yi-Han Lou, Jia-Bao Lu, Chen Cheng, Yan Shen, Bernard Moussian, Chuan-Xi Zhang</name></author><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5175.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5175</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>7e212ed8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5175.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>A comprehensive omics analysis and functional survey of cuticular proteins in the brown planthopper [Developmental Biology]</title><unread>True</unread><description>Cuticle, mainly composed of chitin and cuticular proteins (CPs), is a multifunctional structure of arthropods.

Characterisation and thermal deterioration of desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk is presented for the first time using the potential of Fluorescence spectroscopy. The emission bands in non-heated desi ghee centred at 375 nm is labelled for vitamin D, 390 nm for vitamin K, 440–460 nm for isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), 490 nm for vitamin A and the region 620–700 nm is assigned to chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission spectra from all the heated and non-heated ghee samples were recorded using excitation wavelengths at 280, and 410 nm which were found best for getting maximum spectral signatures. Heating of desi ghee affects its molecular composition, however, the temperature range from 140 to 170°C may be defined safe for cooking /frying where it does not lose much of its molecular composition. Further, the rise in temperature induces prominent spectral variations which confirm the deterioration of valuable vitamins, isomers of CLA and chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission peak at 552 nm shows oxidation product and an increase in its intensity with the rise in temperature is observed. In order to classify heated samples at different temperatures, principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied on heated and non-heated ghee samples that further elucidated the temperature effects.</description><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naveed Ahmad, M.

Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models. Answering “yes” to the screening questions regarding reduced dietary intake and weight loss was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (respectively OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.59, 4.45) and OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.76)). In conclusion, we demonstrate SSI to occur more often among patients at nutritional risk as compared to those who are not at nutritional risk. Future studies should investigate interventions to prevent both SSI and nutritional risk among surgical patients.</description><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eli Skeie, Anne Mette Koch, Stig Harthug, Unni Fosse, Kari Sygnestveit, Roy Miodini Nilsen, Randi J.

One of the most promising approaches to improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the augmentation of spontaneously occurring plasticity in uninjured neural pathways. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH, brief exposures to reduced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels alternating with normal O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels) initiates plasticity in respiratory systems and has been shown to improve recovery in respiratory and non-respiratory spinal systems after SCI in experimental animals and humans. Although the mechanism by which AIH elicits its effects after SCI are not well understood, AIH is known to alter protein expression in spinal neurons in uninjured animals. Here, we examine hypoxia- and plasticity-related protein expression using immunofluorescence in spinal neurons in SCI rats that were treated with AIH combined with motor training, a protocol which has been demonstrated to improve recovery of forelimb function in this lesion model. Specifically, we assessed protein expression in spinal neurons from animals with incomplete cervical SCI which were exposed to AIH treatment + motor training either for 1 or 7 days. AIH treatment consisted of 10 episodes of AIH: (5 min 11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 min 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 7 days beginning at 4 weeks post-SCI. Both 1 or 7 days of AIH treatment + motor training resulted in significantly increased expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) relative to normoxia-treated controls, in neurons both proximal (cervical) and remote (lumbar) to the SCI. All other markers examined were significantly elevated in the 7 day AIH + motor training group only, at both cervical and lumbar levels. These markers included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In summary, AIH induces plasticity at the cellular level after SCI by altering the expression of major plasticity- and hypoxia-related proteins at spinal regions proximal and remote to the SCI. These changes occur under the same AIH protocol which resulted in recovery of limb function in this animal model. Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</description><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Atiq Hassan, Breanna M.

is explained in terms of competing ion-water and water-water interactions along with

Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 μg/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male &lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&lt;/i&gt;. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 μg/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug.</description><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ronald David MacLaren, Kathryn Wisniewski, Christina MacLaren&lt;/p&gt;

The protozoan &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; sp. cause diseases in humans and animals. Studies of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;brucei&lt;/i&gt; cell biology have revealed unique features, such as major endocytic events being limited to a single region, and mitochondrial genome segregation mediated via basal bodies. Further understanding of trypanosome cell biology can be facilitated with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Lack of a plasma membrane probe for fixed trypanosomes remains a persistent problem in need of a working solution. Herein, we report protocols developed using mCLING in super-resolution structured illumination fluorescence microscopy (SR-SIM). mCLING comprehensively labels flagellar membranes, including nascent intracellular stages. To extend its usefulness for trypanosome biology we optimized mCLING in combination with organelle-specific antibodies for immunofluorescence of basal bodies or mitochondria. Then in work with live trypanosomes, we demonstrated internalization of mCLING into endocytic stations that overlap with LysoTracker in acidic organelles. Greater detail of the intracellular location of mCLING was obtained with SR-SIM after pulsing trypanosomes with the probe, and allowing continuous uptake of fluorescent concanavalin A (ConA) destined for lysosomes. In most cases, ConA and mCLING vesicles were juxtaposed but not coincident. A video of the complete image stack at the 15 min time point shows zones of mCLING staining surrounding patches of ConA, consistent with persistence of mCLING in membranes of compartments that contain luminal ConA. In summary, these studies establish mCLING as a versatile trypanosome membrane probe compatible with super-resolution microscopy that can be used for detailed analysis of flagellar membrane biogenesis. In addition, mCLING can be used for immunofluorescence in fixed, permeabilized trypanosomes. Its robust staining of the plasma membrane eliminates a need to overlay transmitted light images on fluorescence pictures obtained from widefield, confocal, or super-resolution microscopy.</description><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Justin Wiedeman, Kojo Mensa-Wilmot&lt;/p&gt;
The protozoan &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; sp. cause diseases in humans and animals. Studies of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;brucei&lt;/i&gt; cell biology have revealed unique features, such as major endocytic events being limited to a single region, and mitochondrial genome segregation mediated via basal bodies. Further understanding of trypanosome cell biology can be facilitated with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Lack of a plasma membrane probe for fixed trypanosomes remains a persistent problem in need of a working solution. Herein, we report protocols developed using mCLING in super-resolution structured illumination fluorescence microscopy (SR-SIM). mCLING comprehensively labels flagellar membranes, including nascent intracellular stages. To extend its usefulness for trypanosome biology we optimized mCLING in combination with organelle-specific antibodies for immunofluorescence of basal bodies or mitochondria.

A universal turnaround has been detected in many countries of the World from shrinking to expanding forests. The forest area of western Europe expanded already in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Such early trends of forest resources cannot be associated with the rapid rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide nor with the anthropogenic climate change, which have taken place since the mid 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Modern, most recent spatial patterns of forest expansions and contractions do not correlate with the geography of climate trends nor with dry versus moist areas. Instead, the forest resources trends of nations correlate positively with UNDP Human Development Index. This indicates that forest resources of nations have improved along with progress in human well-being. Highly developed countries apply modern agricultural methods on good farmlands and abandon marginal lands, which become available for forest expansion. Developed countries invest in sustainable programs of forest management and nature protection. Our findings are significant for predicting the future of the terrestrial carbon sink. They suggest that the large sink of carbon recently observed in forests of the World will persist, if the well-being of people continues to improve. However, despite the positive trends in domestic forests, developed nations increasingly outsource their biomass needs abroad through international trade, and all nations rely on unsustainable energy use and wasteful patterns of material consumption.</description><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pekka E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Achieving proper rotational alignment of the femoral component in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for valgus knee is challenging because of lateral condylar hypoplasia and lateral cartilage erosion. Gap-based navigation-assisted TKA enables surgeons to determine the angle of femoral component rotation (FCR) based on the posterior condylar axis. This study evaluated the possible factors that affect the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Between 2008 and 2016, 28 knees were enrolled. The dependent variable for this study was FCR based on the posterior condylar axis, which was obtained from the navigation system archives. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might predict FCR, including body mass index (BMI), Kellgren-Lawrence grade (K-L grade), lateral distal femoral angles obtained from the navigation system and radiographs (NaviLDFA, XrayLDFA), hip-knee-ankle (HKA) axis, lateral gap under varus stress (LGVS), medial gap under valgus stress (MGVS), and side-to-side difference (STSD, MGVS − LGVS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean FCR was 6.1° ± 2.0°. Of all the potentially predictive factors evaluated in this study, only NaviLDFA (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = −0.668) and XrayLDFA (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = −0.714) predicted significantly FCR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The LDFAs, as determined using radiographs and the navigation system, were both predictive of the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis in gap-based TKA for valgus knee. A 1° increment with NaviLDFA led to a 0.668° decrement in FCR, and a 1° increment with XrayLDFA led to a 0.714° decrement. This suggests that symmetrical lateral condylar hypoplasia of the posterior and distal side occurs in lateral compartment end-stage osteoarthritis with valgus deformity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sung-Sahn Lee, Yong-In Lee, Dong-Uk Kim, Dae-Hee Lee, Young-Wan Moon&lt;/p&gt;

Loss or gain of copy number of the gene encoding the transcription factor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) leads to neurodevelopmental disorders (Rett and MeCP2 duplication syndrome), indicating that precisely regulated MeCP2 expression during development is critical for mental health. Consistent with this idea, MeCP2 null mutants exhibit synaptic regression in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the visual relay center in the thalamus, a phenotype resembling that of animals reared in the dark during the visual sensitive period. It remains unclear how MeCP2 expression is regulated during circuit formation and maturation, especially in excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons. We found that, concomitant with the initiation of the dark-rearing sensitive period, MeCP2 protein levels were elevated in glutamatergic but not GABAergic neurons of the dLGN. Moreover, MeCP2 expression in glutamatergic populations was selectively reduced by dark-rearing. Therefore, we propose that visual experience–dependent MeCP2 induction in glutamatergic populations is essential for synaptic maturation within the dLGN.</description><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Yagasaki, Goichi Miyoshi, Mariko Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Several specialty societies participate in the Choosing Wisely (CW) campaign in an attempt to reduce waste in health care spending. We surveyed internal medicine (IM) residents with an objective of classifying knowledge of and confidence in using the American Society of Hematology (ASH) CW principles in hemostasis, thrombosis, and non-malignant hematology.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Multi-institutional study of IM residents at 5 academic training programs in the United States. A 10-question, case-based multiple choice test, with each question accompanied by a 5-point Likert-scale confidence assessment, was distributed electronically. Responses were summarized with frequencies and percentages or medians and ranges, as appropriate. Two sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare confidence and knowledge scores.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 892 IM residents, 174 (19.5%) responded to all questions. Overall, residents answered a median of 7 of 10 questions correctly (range 2–10) and median resident confidence in their responses was 3.1 (on a 5-point scale). Correct responses were significantly associated with higher confidence for all but one question. Having a hematology rotation experience was significantly associated with more correct responses and with higher confidence (&lt;i&gt;p = 0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt;, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;IM residents at several academic hospitals have variable knowledge of ASH-CW guidelines in thrombosis and hemostasis/non-malignant hematology.

To explore the associations between genetic factors and phenotypes, genome-wide association studies are broadly applied.

Results: We present a novel bioinformatics approach in the field of neuropsychology that integrates current state-of-the-art tools, algorithms and brain transcriptome data to elaborate the association of phenotype and genotype data. The integration of transcriptome data gives an advantage over the existing pipelines by directly translating genetic associations to brain regions and developmental patterns. Based on our data integrative approach, we identify genetic variants associated with Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in an autism cohort and found their respective genes to be expressed in specific brain areas. Conclusion: Our data integrative approach revealed that IQ is related to early down-regulated and late up-regulated gene modules implicated in frontal cortex and striatum, respectively. Besides identifying new gene associations with IQ we also provide a proof of concept, as several of the identified genes in our analysis are candidate genes related to intelligence in autism, intellectual disability, and Alzheimer&apos;s disease.

The framework provides a complete extensive analysis starting from a phenotypic trait data to its association at specific brain areas at vulnerable time points within a timespan of four days.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528009200000</published><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/03/336776</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163c64dfba2:466c289:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Mengjie Yu</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04350-1</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>ec04593e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/0EX8AXnqDYo/s41467-018-04350-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Silicon-chip-based mid-infrared dual-comb spectroscopy</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04350-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silicon-chip-based mid-infrared dual-comb spectroscopy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silicon-chip-based mid-infrared dual-comb spectroscopy, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04350-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04350-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dual-comb spectroscopy is a powerful tool for realizing rapid spectroscopic measurements with high sensitivity and selectivity.

However, multi-mycotoxin exposure assessment in breast milk has received very limited attention so far, resulting in a poor understanding of exposure during the early months of life. Here, we present the development and first application of a highly sensitive, specific and quantitative assay assessing up to 28 mycotoxins including regulated (aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone) and emerging mycotoxins as well as key metabolites by LC-MS/MS. After careful optimization of the sample preparation procedure, a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) protocol combined with a freeze-out step was utilized for method validation after spiking blank breast milk matrix. The limits of quantification varied between 0.009 and 2.9 ng/mL, for most analytes extraction recovery (74-116%) and intermediate precision (2-25%) were satisfactory. To assess multi-mycotoxin exposure for the first time in breast milk, the method was applied to examine contamination in 75 samples from Ogun State, Nigeria. Most of the samples were either entirely free of mycotoxins or contaminated to a minimal extent. Interestingly, the most abundant mycotoxin was beauvericin, which was not reported in this biological fluid before, with concentrations up to 0.019 ng/mL. In conclusion, the method demonstrated to be fit for purpose to determine and quantify low background contaminations in human breast milk. Based on the high sensitivity of the novel analytical method, it was possible to deduce that tolerable daily intake values were not exceeded by breastfeeding in the examined infants.</description><fingerprint>c517fcad</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Unraveling_Early-Life_Mycotoxin_Exposures_via_LC-MS_MS_Breast_Milk_Analysis/6391121</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Unraveling Early-Life Mycotoxin Exposures via LC-MS/MS Breast Milk Analysis</title><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Unraveling_Early-Life_Mycotoxin_Exposures_via_LC-MS_MS_Breast_Milk_Analysis/6391121</link><summary><content>Infants are particularly susceptible towards the toxic effects of food contaminants including mycotoxins.

Glioblastoma is a primary brain tumor with a poor prognosis despite of many treatment regimens. Radiotherapy significantly prolongs patient survival and remains the most common treatment. Slit2 and Robo1 are evolutionarily conserved proteins involved in axon guidance, migration, and branching of neuronal cells. New studies have shown that Slit2 and Robo1 could play important roles in leukocyte chemotaxis and glioblastoma cell migration. Therefore, we investigated whether the Slit2/Robo1 complex has an impact on the motility of glioblastoma cells and whether irradiation with therapeutic doses modulates this effect. Our results indicate that photon irradiation increases the migration of glioblastoma cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. qPCR and immunoblotting experiments in two different glioblastoma cell lines (U-373 MG and U-87 MG) with different malignancy revealed that both Slit2 and Robo1 are significantly lower expressed in the cell populations with the highest motility and that the expression was reduced after irradiation. Overexpression of Robo1 significantly decreased the motility of glioblastoma cells and inhibited the accelerated migration of wild-type cells after irradiation. Immunoblotting analysis of migration-associated proteins (fascin and focal adhesion kinase) and of the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition-related protein vimentin showed that irradiation affected the migration of glioblastoma cells by increasing vimentin expression, which can be reversed by the overexpression of Slit2 and Robo1. Our findings suggest that Robo1 expression might counteract migration and also radiation-induced migration of glioblastoma cells, a process that might be connected to mesenchymal-epithelial transition.</description><fingerprint>83b99c00</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198508</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Robo1 and vimentin regulate radiation-induced motility of human glioblastoma cells</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pascaline Nguemgo Kouam, Günther A.

is how the peptide fleets through a set of transition states which dominate the

indicate a single fold pathway while the simulations suggest peptides owns the

that 78.5% of the peptide adopts the Pathways I during their folding/unfolding
in a nanopore while 21.5% of the peptide undergoes the hidden folding/unfolding

reveals a harmonic structure difference of the metastable

major structure vibrations which agree well with the theoretical expectation.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates genes in many physiological pathways by binding to enhancer and silencer elements of target genes, where it recruits coregulator proteins that remodel chromatin and regulate the assembly of transcription complexes. The coregulator Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is necessary for glucocorticoid (GC) regulation of one group of GR target genes, is irrelevant for a second group, and inhibits GR binding to a third gene set, thereby blocking their regulation by GC. Gene-specific characteristics that distinguish GR binding regions (GBR) at Hic-5 blocked genes from GBR at other GC-regulated genes are unknown. Here we show genome-wide that blocked GBR generally require CHD9 and BRM for GR occupancy in contrast to GBR that are not blocked by Hic-5. Hic-5 blocked GBR are enriched near Hic-5 blocked GR target genes but not near GR target genes that are not blocked by Hic-5. Furthermore blocked GBR are in a closed conformation prior to Hic-5 depletion, and require Hic-5 depletion and glucocorticoid treatment to create an open conformation necessary for GR occupancy. A transcription factor binding motif characteristic of the ETS family was enriched near blocked GBR and blocked genes but not near non-blocked GBR or non-blocked GR target genes. Thus, we identify specific differences in chromatin conformation, chromatin remodeler requirements, and local DNA sequence motifs that contribute to gene-specific actions of transcription factors and coregulators. These findings shed light on mechanisms that contribute to binding site selection by transcription factors, which vary in a cell type-specific manner.</description><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Brian H.

Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo) in the rat is a widely used animal model of vascular dementia and a valuable tool for preclinical pharmacological drug testing, although the varying degrees of acute focal ischemic lesions it induces could interfere with its translational value. Recently, a modification to the BCCAo model, the stepwise occlusion of the two carotid arteries, has been introduced. To acquire objective translatable measures, we used longitudinal multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the effects of semi-chronic (8 days) donepezil treatment in this model, with half of the Wistar rats receiving the treatment one week after the stepwise BCCAo. With an ultrahigh field MRI, we measured high-resolution anatomy, diffusion tensor imaging, cerebral blood flow measurements and functional MRI in response to whisker stimulation, to evaluate both the structural and functional effects of the donepezil treatment and stepwise BCCAo up to 5 weeks post-occlusion. While no large ischemic lesions were detected, atrophy in the striatum and in the neocortex, along with widespread white matter microstructural changes, were found. Donepezil ameliorated the transient drop in the somatosensory BOLD response in distant cortical areas, as detected 2 weeks after the occlusion but the drug had no effect on the long term structural changes. Our results demonstrate a measurable functional MRI effect of the donepezil treatment and the importance of diffusion MRI and voxel based morphometry (VBM) analysis in the translational evaluation of the rat BCCAo model.</description><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriella Nyitrai, Tamás Spisák, Zsófia Spisák, Dávid Gajári, Pálma Diószegi, Tamás Zsigmond Kincses, András Czurkó&lt;/p&gt;

Although it has been recognized that intestinal bacteria play an important role in the pathology of human ulcerative colitis (UC), specific pathogenic bacteria for UC have not been identified. We investigated the influence of &lt;i&gt;Paraclostridium bifermentans&lt;/i&gt; PAGU1678 strain on the pathology of a UC mouse model and found it increased UC pathosis scores such as loose and bloody stools, reduced diversity of fecal flora, disappearance of the crypt structure of distal colon tissue, destruction of intestinal epithelial cells, and atrophy of the colon.

Although it has been recognized that intestinal bacteria play an important role in the pathology of human ulcerative colitis (UC), specific pathogenic bacteria for UC have not been identified. We investigated the influence of &lt;i&gt;Paraclostridium bifermentans&lt;/i&gt; PAGU1678 strain on the pathology of a UC mouse model and found it increased UC pathosis scores such as loose and bloody stools, reduced diversity of fecal flora, disappearance of the crypt structure of distal colon tissue, destruction of intestinal epithelial cells, and atrophy of the colon. Furthermore, we observed an increase in &lt;i&gt;COX-2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF-α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;IL-17&lt;/i&gt; expression and a decrease in &lt;i&gt;Foxp3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; expression, as inflammation-related factors and inflammatory cytokines, a decrease in the concentration of short chain fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) in feces, and an increase of intestinal mucosal myeloperoxidase activity. These results suggest that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bifermentans&lt;/i&gt; PAGU1678 is a pathology-exacerbating factor in a mouse model of UC.

Caesarean section (CS) has short and long term adverse health consequences, and should therefore only be undertaken when necessary. Risk factors such as maternal age, maternal body mass index (BMI) and fetal weight have been extensively investigated in relation to CS, but the significance of maternal height has been less explored in Sweden. The aim was to investigate the significance of maternal height on risk of CS in a representative, population-based sample from Sweden, also taking into account confounders. Data on singleton births in the Swedish Pregnancy Register 2011 to 2016 were collected, including women with heights of 140 cm and above, constituting a sample of 581,844 women. Data were analysed with epidemiological and biostatistical methods. Mean height was 166.1 cm. Women born outside Sweden were significantly shorter than women born in Sweden (162.8 cm vs. 167.1 cm, p&amp;lt;0.001). There was a decreasing risk of CS with increasing maternal height. This effect remained after adjustment for other risk factors for CS such as maternal age, BMI, gestational age, parity, high birth weight and country of birth. Frequency of CS was higher among women born outside Sweden compared with Swedish-born women (17.3% vs. 16.0%), however, in a multiple regression model country of birth outside Sweden diminished as a risk factor for CS. Maternal height of 178–179 cm was associated with the lowest risk of CS (OR = 0.76, CI95% 0.71–0.81), whereas height below 160 cm explained 7% of CS cases. BMI and maternal age are established factors involved in clinical assessments related to birth, and maternal height should increasingly enjoy a similar status in these considerations. Moreover, when healthcare professionals are counselling pregnant women, taller stature should be more emphasized as a positive indicator for successful vaginal birth to increase pregnant women’s confidence in giving birth vaginally, with possible positive impacts for lowering CS rates.</description><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ingrid Mogren, Maria Lindqvist, Kerstin Petersson, Carin Nilses, Rhonda Small, Gabriel Granåsen, Kristina Edvardsson&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of two forms (CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CuS); and Cu nanoparticles (CuNP)) and dosages (standard 6.5 mg/kg (H), half of the standard (L)) of additional dietary Cu administered to growing rats on gastrointestinal and hepatic function and morphology. Copper in the form of CuNP vs CuS caused lower Cu faecal/urinal excretion and increased Cu accumulation in the brain tissue. Hepatic high-grade hydropic degeneration and necrotic lesions were observed only in the CuNP-H animals. In the lower gut, the dietary application of CuNP stifled bacterial enzymatic activity of caecal gut microbiota and resulted in lower SCFA production. That diminishing effect of CuNP on caecal microbiota activity was accompanied by a relative increase in the secretion of glycoside hydrolases by bacterial cells. The results showed that in comparison to Cu from CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Cu nanoparticles to a greater extent were absorbed from the intestine, accumulated in brain tissue, exerted antimicrobial effect in the caecum, and at higher dietary dose caused damages in the liver of rats.</description><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ewelina Cholewińska, Katarzyna Ognik, Bartosz Fotschki, Zenon Zduńczyk, Jerzy Juśkiewicz&lt;/p&gt;

The results showed that in comparison to Cu from CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Cu nanoparticles to a greater extent were absorbed from the intestine, accumulated in brain tissue, exerted antimicrobial effect in the caecum, and at higher dietary dose caused damages in the liver of rats.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526331600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197083</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197083</canonicalUrl><author><name>Ewelina Cholewińska</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd0:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Ozisik, O.</name></author><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/316562v1?rss=1</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>9da660c6</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/316562v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>A Scoring System to Evaluate the Impact of SNPs in a Path Related Context to Study Behcet&apos;s Disease Aetiology in Japanese Population [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/316562v1?rss=1</link><description>Motivation: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful method that can provide a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly related to the pathogenesis of a disease.

Safe and efficacious orally-delivered mucosal vaccine platforms are desperately needed to combat the plethora of mucosally transmitted pathogens. &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. have emerged as attractive candidates to meet this need and are known to activate the host innate immune response in a species- and strain-specific manner. For selected bacterial isolates and mutants, we investigated the role of key innate immune pathways required for induction of innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Co-culture of murine macrophages with &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gasseri&lt;/i&gt; (strain NCK1785), &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;acidophilus&lt;/i&gt; (strain NCFM), or NCFM-derived mutants—NCK2025 and NCK2031—elicited an M2b-like phenotype associated with TH2 skewing and immune regulatory function. For NCFM, this M2b phenotype was dependent on expression of lipoteichoic acid and S layer proteins. Through the use of macrophage genetic knockouts, we identified Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) receptor, and the inflammasome-associated caspase-1 as contributors to macrophage activation, with NOD2 cooperating with caspase-1 to induce inflammasome derived interleukin (IL)-1β in a pyroptosis-independent fashion. Finally, utilizing an NCFM-based mucosal vaccine platform with surface expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag or membrane proximal external region (MPER), we demonstrated that NOD2 signaling is required for antigen-specific mucosal and systemic humoral responses. We show that lactobacilli differentially utilize innate immune pathways and highlight NOD2 as a key mediator of macrophage function and antigen-specific humoral responses to a &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus acidophilus&lt;/i&gt; mucosal vaccine platform.</description><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sara A.

Flightless saproxylic beetles were selected in order to study the impact of temporal and spatial discontinuity of forests. They were chosen because: (1) they are unable to fly, making them dispersal-limited species, (2) they have a saproxylic diet, which means they are closely linked to the forest, and (3), they have rarely been studied. Forest temporal continuity was expected to be the main factor explaining the presence of these species, modulated by the past and present amount of forest in the surrounding landscape. Twenty-seven forests, distributed into three zones, were sampled in southwestern France. Flightless saproxylic beetles were surveyed using a Winkler extractor and a Berlese funnel. Their presence/absence were modelled using generalised linear mixed models, with zone variable as random effect. Two species showed significant &lt;i&gt;zone&lt;/i&gt; effect and were only or more present in the zone with the highest present forest amount in a 0.5 km radius. In the model that converged, the only selected variable was the past amount of forest in the landscape. The size of the forest, the presence of dead wood and the forest temporal continuity were not included in this model. The importance of the amount of forest in the landscape supports the hypothesis that dispersal-limited species are affected by landscape characteristics.

Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001).

Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses.

A new set of efficient solvent-free dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) force fields was developed for phospholipids and peptides. To enhance transferability, this model maps around four heavy atoms and their connected hydrogen atoms into a coarse-grained elementary bead based on functional group. The effective hybrid potential between any pair of beads is composed of a short-range repulsive soft-core potential that directly adopts the form of an explicit-solvent DPD model and a long-range attractive hydrophobic potential. The parameters of the attractive potentials for lipid molecules were obtained by fitting the explicit-solvent DPD simulation of one bead of any type in a water box, then finely tuning it until the bilayer membrane properties obtained in the explicit-solvent model were matched. These parameters were further extended to amino acids according to bead type. The structural and elastic properties of bilayer membranes, free energy profiles for a lipid flip-flop and amino acid analogues translocating across the membrane, and membrane pore formation induced by antimicrobial peptides obtained from this solvent-free DPD force field considerably agreed with the explicit-solvent DPD results. Importantly, the efficiency of this method is guaranteed to accelerate the assembly of vesicles composed of several thousand lipids by up to 50-fold, rendering the experimental liposome dynamics as well as membrane-peptide interactions feasible at accessible computational expense.</description><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mingwei Wan, Lianghui Gao, Weihai Fang&lt;/p&gt;

The type C feruloyl esterase FoFaeC from &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; is a newly discovered enzyme with high potential for use in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass but it shows low activity towards sinapates. In this work, small molecule docking simulations were employed in order to identify important residues for the binding of the four model methyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids, methyl ferulate/caffeate/sinapate/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumarate, to the predicted structure of FoFaeC. Subsequently rational redesign was applied to the enzyme’ active site in order to improve its specificity towards methyl sinapate. A double mutation (F230H/T202V) was considered to provide hydrophobic environment for stabilization of the methoxy substitution on sinapate and a larger binding pocket.

All clones showed improved activity, substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and turnover rate compared to the wild type against methyl sinapate, with clone P13 showing a 5-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency.

Although the affinity of all mutant clones was improved against the four model substrates, the catalytic efficiency and turnover rate decreased for the substrates containing a hydroxyl substitution.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527195600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198127</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198127</canonicalUrl><author><name>Io Antonopoulou</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4eb:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00293/20180524/images/medium/jm-2018-00293p_0014.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00293&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Thirty-eight percent of US adult women are obese, meaning that more children are now born of overweight and obese mothers, leading to an increase in predisposition to several adult onset diseases. To explore this phenomenon, we developed a maternal obesity animal model by feeding mice a diet composed of high fat/ high sugar (HF/HS) and assessed both maternal diet and offspring diet on the development of endometrial cancer (ECa). We show that maternal diet by itself did not lead to ECa initiation in wildtype offspring of the C57Bl/6J mouse strain. While offspring fed a HF/HS post-weaning diet resulted in poor metabolic health and decreased uterine weight (regardless of maternal diet), it did not lead to ECa. We also investigated the effects of the maternal obesogenic diet on ECa development in a Diethylstilbestrol (DES) carcinogenesis mouse model. All mice injected with DES had reproductive tract lesions including decreased number of glands, condensed and hyalinized endometrial stroma, and fibrosis and increased collagen deposition that in some mice extended into the myometrium resulting in extensive disruption and loss of the inner and outer muscular layers. Fifty percent of DES mice that were exposed to maternal HF/HS diet developed several features indicative of the initial stages of carcinogenesis including focal glandular and atypical endometrial hyperplasia versus 0% of their Chow counterparts. There was an increase in phospho-Akt expression in DES mice exposed to maternal HF/HS diet, a regulator of persistent proliferation in the endometrium, and no difference in total Akt, phospho-PTEN and total PTEN expression. In summary, maternal HF/HS diet exposure induces endometrial hyperplasia and other precancerous phenotypes in mice treated with DES. This study suggests that maternal obesity alone is not sufficient for the development of ECa, but has an additive effect in the presence of a secondary insult such as DES.</description><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Theresa O.

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critical to adaptive immune defence mechanisms in vertebrate species and are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Polymorphic sites are located close to the ligand-binding groove and entail MHC-I alleles with distinct binding specificities. Some efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between polymorphism and protein stability. However, less is known about the relationship between polymorphism and MHC-I co-evolutionary constraints. Using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pinpoints structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by inter-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability. These results suggest that sites displaying high polymorphism may have been selected during vertebrates’ evolution to avoid co-evolutionary constraints and thereby maximize their mutability.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5R4fGWtz6gQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006188</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5R4fGWtz6gQ/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Polymorphic sites preferentially avoid co-evolving residues in MHC class I proteins</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><crawled>1526935170348</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Dib, Nicolas Salamin, David Gfeller&lt;/p&gt;

We implemented a web server that compares new datasets to collected data employing fast matching methods in order to determine cell types, key genes, similar prior studies, and more.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527750000000</published><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/31/323238</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163b818103a:337b3e1:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Meihong Chen</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>d92b991f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/rMN9sc_wO_s/s41598-018-26335-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26335-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/rMN9sc_wO_s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1526980668897</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26335-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/rMN9sc_wO_s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526972400000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>599</width><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26335-2/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26335_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1638723ede1:6bed1e7:93d646dc</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/E4952.short?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>56f5544f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/E4952.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Correction for Xu et al., Drought delays development of the sorghum root microbiome and enriches for monoderm bacteria [Correction]</title><unread>True</unread><description>PLANT BIOLOGY Correction for “Drought delays development of the sorghum root microbiome and enriches for monoderm bacteria,” by Ling Xu, Dan Naylor, Zhaobin Dong, Tuesday Simmons, Grady Pierroz, Kim K.

Mitotane is the reference drug for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and the metabolic activation of the drug is considered as essential for its activity. The aim of this study was to assess the role of CYP11B1 on mitotane action and metabolism in H295R ACC cells to understand whether this enzyme may influence mitotane action. The simultaneous incubation with mitotane and metyrapone, an adrenolytic molecule targeting 11-beta-hydroxylase, did not influence mitotane-mediated cytotoxic effect and metabolism in H295R ACC cells. CYP11B1 silencing confirmed the lack of a significant metyrapone effect on mitotane action. The present findings do not support the view that CYP11B1 catalyzes a crucial step in the metabolic activation of mitotane and that CYP11B1 confers the adrenal specificity to mitotane.</description><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antonina Germano, Laura Saba, Silvia De Francia, Ida Rapa, Paola Perotti, Alfredo Berruti, Marco Volante, Massimo Terzolo&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Limited studies have investigated geographic accessibility to a nearby community pharmacy for elderly which is an essential determinant of the access to medications and pharmacy services. This research identified pharmacy deserts and investigated availability of different types of community pharmacies and their services for elderly enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The state of Pennsylvania in the US was used as a case to demonstrate the geographic accessibility to community pharmacy and services for elderly enrolled in SPAP. The locations of community pharmacies and households of elderly enrolled in SPAP were derived from Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly programs’ database. The street addresses were geocoded and the distance to a nearby community pharmacy was calculated for study sample using the haversine formula. The demographic and geographic data were aggregated to Census Tracts and pharmacy deserts were identified using the predefined criteria. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to determine whether there are statistical differences in the socio-demographic profiles and distribution of different types of community pharmacies and their services in pharmacy deserts and non-deserts. This research used hot spot analyses at county level to identify clusters of pharmacy deserts, areas with high concentration of different racial/ethnic groups and clusters of high densities of chain and independent pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The Spatial analysis revealed that 39% and 61% Census Tracts in Pennsylvania were pharmacy deserts and non-deserts respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Pharmacy deserts were found to have significantly more females, married and white elderly and fewer blacks and Hispanics compared to pharmacy non-deserts. Pharmacy deserts had significantly fewer chain and independent pharmacies and less delivery and 24-hour services in pharmacies than pharmacy non-deserts. Hot spot analyses showed that clusters of pharmacy deserts were more concentrated in southcentral, northwest and northeast regions of the state which represent rural areas and overlapped with clusters of high concentration of white individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that urban-rural inequality, racial/ethnic disparity and differences in availability of pharmacies and their services exist between pharmacy deserts and non-deserts. The methodological approach and analyses used in this study can also be applied to other public health programs to evaluate the coverage and breadth of public health services.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>4aca7a5e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198173</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Mapping pharmacy deserts and determining accessibility to community pharmacy services for elderly enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Priti Pednekar, Andrew Peterson&lt;/p&gt;

Here, physiological and comparative transcriptome approaches were used to reveal the molecular basis of pericarp pigmentation in &apos;Red Delicious&apos; and its four generation mutants including &apos;Starking Red&apos;, &apos;Starkrimson&apos;, &apos;Campbell Redchief&apos; and &apos;Vallee spur&apos;. It was found that the pericarp pigmentation was gradually proliferated from G0 to G4. The activation of early phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway genes including ASP3, PAL, 4CL, PER, CHS, CYP98A and F3&apos;H were more responsible for anthocyanin accumulation. In addition, the down-regulation of AACT1, HMGS, HMGR, MVK, MVD2, IDI1 and FPPS2 involved in terpenoid biosynthesis influence anthocyanin accumulation by positively regulating the expression of AUX1 and SAUR that contributed to the synthesis of IAA, GID2 to GA, PP2C and SnRK2 to ABA. MYB and bHLH members which highly correlated (0.882&amp;lt;|r|=0.980) with anthocyanin contents modulated anthocyanin accumulation in apple pericarp by regulating the transcription of structural genes including CHS and F3&apos;H involved in flavonoid pathway.

According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b00931&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, you can do hydrogenation reactions in a stainless-steel ball mill, without any sort of noble-metal catalyst. The hydrogen is produced when you add some n-alkane or diethyl ether to the mix (these actually get converted to gaseous methane and hydrogen under the milling conditions). Some pretty severe reductions are realized, for example, taking biphenyl all the way down to 1-cyclohexylcyclohexane. Olefins go to alkanes under these conditions, of course, and ketones and alcohols tend to just get erased: it’s a bulldozer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although it’s surprising, this reaction isn’t quite as much voodoo as it might appear. Well, not more than any other hydrogenation, anyway. The ball mill is, of course, a sealed vessel, and the authors show that the lower-boiling additives seem to be more effective, presumably because they increase the internal pressure. And it’s not like there’s no catalyst present, because you have the stainless steel. If you use zirconium oxide balls instead of the steel alloy ones, for example, you get no hydrogenation at all. Adding bits of different metals back in showed that the chromium is what’s producing the hydrogen from the alkanes or ether, while the nickel is acting as the hydrogenation catalyst itself. The stainless-steel alloy itself (304 steel) was the most effective combination, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balls do get eroded a bit under the conditions, so what you’ve got is finely divided metals, under some heat from the mechanical energy of the milling, and under hydrogen pressure from the decomposition of the co-reactants. No wonder things get reduced! But it’s not a reaction that you would have predicted up front. And even if you’d stipulated that hydrogenation would start under these conditions, I don’t think you would have guessed how powerful it would be. The last time I hydrogenated down a whole aryl system (it’s been a while), I was running at something like 1600 psi (110 bar) at 120C with a rhodium catalyst, and the stuff came out looking – and smelling – like old lawnmower oil. This reaction probably doesn’t get above 60 degrees, by contrast. Admittedly, there’s no word in the paper about the appearance or aroma of the crude products, but I’m willing to bet that that part remains the same. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525866196000</published><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13523</link><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/09/hydrogenating-in-a-ball-mill</canonicalUrl><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_16344bbf04e:ab482a:93d646dc</id></item><item><engagement>35</engagement><author><name>Lisa Randall</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05096-y</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>de0681ff</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05096-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>What Is Dark Matter?</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05096-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Is Dark Matter?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Is Dark Matter?, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05096-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05096-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An elusive substance that permeates the universe exerts many detectable gravitational influences yet eludes direct detection.</description><crawled>1525858754673</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Is Dark Matter?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Is Dark Matter?, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05096-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05096-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An elusive substance that permeates the universe exerts many detectable gravitational influences yet eludes direct detection.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525849200000</published><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05096-y/d41586-018-05096-y_15738964.jpg</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1634444e071:9c5458:3dd877af</id></item><item><description>The source function (SF) decomposes the electron density at any point into contributions from all other points in the molecule, complex, or crystal.

Determining how proteins interact to form stable complexes is of crucial importance, for example in the development of novel therapeutics. Computational methods to determine the thermodynamically stable conformation of complexes from the structure of the binding partners, such as RosettaDock, might potentially emerge to become a promising alternative to traditional structure determination methods. However, while models virtually identical to the correct experimental structure can in some cases be generated, the main difficulty remains to discriminate correct or approximately correct models from decoys. This is due to the ruggedness of the free-energy landscape, the approximations intrinsic in the scoring functions, and the intrinsic flexibility of proteins. Here we show that molecular dynamics simulations performed starting from a number top-scoring models can not only discriminate decoys and identify the correct structure, but may also provide information on an initial map of the free energy landscape that elucidates the binding mechanism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nukuSUmhrVc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006182</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/nukuSUmhrVc/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Assessment of &amp;lt;i&gt;ab initio&amp;lt;/i&gt; models of protein complexes by molecular dynamics</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><crawled>1528135388145</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Filip Radom, Andreas Plückthun, Emanuele Paci&lt;/p&gt;

The Hedgehog family of morphogens has long been known to utilize, through the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), the heterotrimeric G protein G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in both canonical and noncanonical forms of signaling. Other G proteins, while not specifically utilized by Smo, may nonetheless provide access to some of the events controlled by it. We reported several years ago that the G protein G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; activates one or more forms of the Gli family of transcription factors. While the Gli transcription factors are well known targets for Smo, the uncertain mechanism of activation by G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and the identity of the targeted Gli(s) limited predictions as to the extent to which G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; might mimic Smo’s actions. We evaluate here the potential for overlap in G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and Smo signaling using C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 cells as models of osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively. We find in C3H10T1/2 cells that a constitutively active form of Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; (Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL) increases Gli1 mRNA, as does a constitutively active form of Smo (SmoA1). We find as well that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL induces alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteogenesis, albeit the induction is far less substantial than that achieved by SmoA1. In 3T3-L1 cells both Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 markedly suppress adipogenic differentiation as determined by triglyceride accumulation. RNA sequencing reveals that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 regulate many of the same genes but that quantitative and qualitative differences exist. Differences also exist, we find, between SmoA1 and purmorphamine, an agonist for Smo. Therefore, while comparisons of constitutively active proteins are informative, extrapolations to the setting of agonists require care.</description><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xueshui Guo, Natalia A.

The precise position of ‘psarolepids’ differs between parsimony and Bayesian analyses.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><crawled>1527577484494</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1527552000000</published><author><name>alice.clement@flinders.edu.au (Alice M Clement)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34349</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163aab69cce:1d0ba79:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>149</engagement><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/783?rss=1</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>76555a04</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/783?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>CO2 electroreduction to ethylene via hydroxide-mediated copper catalysis at an abrupt interface</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electroreduction could provide a useful source of ethylene, but low conversion efficiency, low production rates, and low catalyst stability limit current systems.

Melatonin is a molecule that can enhance the resistance of plants to abiotic stress. It can alleviate the damage of heavy metal ions, and other chemical substances, changes in temperature and humidity, oxidative stress in higher plants, and enhance resistance of plants to abiotic stress. The transformation of N-Acetyl-5-hydroxy tryptamin into melatonin requires the involvement of methyltransferase. In this study, a methyltransferase gene &lt;i&gt;ZjOMT&lt;/i&gt; has been cloned from &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;. The gene was induced by aluminum (Al) stress in the leaves and roots of &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;, and was up-regulated by 20.86- and 31.18-folds, respectively. The expression of ZjOMT in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; increased the content of melatonin by about 8-fold in the recombinant strain compared with that of the empty vector strain. Al resistance test showed that the resistance of recombinant strain BL21-pET32-ZjOMT to Al was significantly higher than that of the empty vector strain BL21-pET32. The survival rate of the recombinant strain expressing ZjOMT was about 100-fold higher than that of the empty vector strain when treated with 0.35 mM Al. These findings suggest that the heterologous expression of ZjOMT improved the resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; to Al by increasing the content of melatonin.</description><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hongsong Luo, Chunyan He, Liebao Han&lt;/p&gt;

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape. We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</description><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoling Dou, Shingo Shirahata, Hiroki Sugimoto&lt;/p&gt;

The behaviour of most animals has evolved in a communication network environment, in which signals produced by senders are perceived by many intended and unintended receivers. In this study, we tested whether the corncrake (&lt;i&gt;Crex crex&lt;/i&gt;), a nocturnal rail species with innate (non-learned) calls, is able to eavesdrop on the interactions of conspecific males and how this eavesdropping affects subsequent responses by the eavesdropper to territorial intrusion. In the first step, simulated aggressive or neutral interactions between male dyads were presented to a focal male. In the second step, the calls of winning, losing or neutral males from the first step were played within the territory of the focal male. We measured behavioural and vocal responses of focal males. We found that corncrakes eavesdropped on signal exchange between rivals. Males often began responding to distant aggressive interactions during the eavesdropping phase, and they responded strongly during the intrusion phase of the experiments. The response was significantly weaker to playback of males from neutral interactions than to those involved in aggressive interactions, and we found no differences between the responses to Winners and Losers entering a focal male territory.</description><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lucyna Ewa Wojas, Paweł Wojciech Podkowa, Tomasz Stanisław Osiejuk&lt;/p&gt;

Accumulating evidence indicates that gut microbiota plays a significant role in obesity, insulin resistance and associated liver disorders. Family &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and especially &lt;i&gt;Enterobacter cloacae&lt;/i&gt; strain B29 have been previously linked to obesity and hepatic damage. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain unclear. Therefore, we comprehensively examined the effects of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC® 13047™) administration on host metabolism of mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). C57BL/6N mice were randomly divided into HFD control, chow control, and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; treatment groups. The &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; treatment group received live bacterial cells in PBS intragastrically twice a week, every other week for 13 weeks. Both control groups received PBS intragastrically. After the 13-week treatment period, the mice were sacrificed for gene and protein expression and functional analyses. Our results show that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; administration increased subcutaneous fat mass and the relative proportion of hypertrophic adipocytes. Both subcutaneous and visceral fat had signs of decreased insulin signaling and elevated lipolysis that was reflected in higher serum glycerol levels.

Previous methods for comparing GO terms have relied on the fact that GO terms are organized into a tree structure. In this paradigm, the locations of two GO terms in the tree dictate their similarity score. In this paper, we introduce two new solutions for this problem, by focusing instead on the definitions of the GO terms. We apply neural network based techniques from the natural language processing (NLP) domain. The first method does not rely on the GO tree, whereas the second indirectly depends on the GO tree. In our first approach, we compare two GO definitions by treating them as two unordered sets of words. The word similarity is estimated by a word embedding model that maps words into an N-dimensional space. In our second approach, we account for the word-ordering within a sentence. We use a sentence encoder to embed GO definitions into vectors and estimate how likely one definition entails another. We validate our methods in two ways. In the first experiment, we test the model&apos;s ability to differentiate a true protein-protein network from a randomly generated network. In the second experiment, we test the model in identifying orthologs from randomly-matched genes in human, mouse, and fly. In both experiments, a hybrid of NLP and GO-tree based method achieves the best classification accuracy.</description><crawled>1526307294811</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>The Gene Ontology (GO) database contains GO terms that describe biological functions of genes.

The cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) is implicated in neuroprotective signaling and neurotoxic pathways in both prion diseases and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (N-PrP) has been shown to interact with neurotoxic ligands, such as Aβ and Scrapie prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;), and to be crucial for the neuroprotective activity of PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;. To gain further insight into cellular pathways tied to PrP, we analyzed the brain interactome of N-PrP. As a novel approach employing recombinantly expressed PrP and intein-mediated protein ligation, we used N-PrP covalently coupled to beads as a bait for affinity purification. N-PrP beads were incubated with human AD or control brain lysates. N-PrP binding partners were then identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nano ESI-MS/MS). In addition to newly identified proteins we found many previously described PrP interactors, indicating a crucial role of the intrinsically disordered part of PrP in mediating protein interactions.

It is common in practicing orthognathic surgery to evaluate faces with retruded or protruded chins (dysgnathic faces) using photographs. Because motion may alter how the face is perceived, we investigated the perception of faces presented via photographs and videos. Two hundred naïve raters (lay persons, without maxillo facial surgery background) evaluated 12 subjects with varying chin anatomy [so-called skeletal Class I (normal chin), Class II (retruded chin), and Class III (protruded chin)]. Starting from eight traits, with Factor analysis we found a two-Factor solution, i.e. an &amp;quot;aesthetics associated traits cluster&amp;quot; and a Factor &amp;quot;personality traits cluster&amp;quot; which appeared to be uncorrelated. Internal consistency of the Factors found for photographs and videos was excellent. Generally, female raters delivered better ratings than males, but the effect sizes were small. We analyzed differences and the respective effect magnitude between photograph and video perception. For each skeletal class the aesthetics associated dimensions were rated similarly between photographs and video clips. In contrast, specific personality traits were rated differently. Differences in the class-specific personality traits seen on photographs were &amp;quot;smoothed&amp;quot; in the assessment of videos, which implies that photos enhance stereotypes commonly attributed to a retruded or protruded chin.</description><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Klaus Sinko, Ulrich S.

QSM calculates the underlying magnetic susceptibility by deconvolving the tissue magnetic field map with a unit dipole kernel. However, this deconvolution problem is ill-posed. The morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI) introduces total variation (TV) to regularize the susceptibility reconstruction. However, MEDI results still contain artifacts near tissue boundaries because MEDI only imposes TV constraint on voxels inside smooth regions. We introduce a Morphology-Adaptive TV (MATV) for improving TV-regularized QSM. The MATV method first classifies imaging target into smooth and nonsmooth regions by thresholding magnitude gradients. In the dipole inversion for QSM, the TV regularization weights are a monotonically decreasing function of magnitude gradients. Thus, voxels inside smooth regions are assigned with larger weights than those in nonsmooth regions. Using phantom and in vivo datasets, we compared the performance of MATV with that of MEDI. MATV results had better visual quality than MEDI results, especially near tissue boundaries. Preliminary brain imaging results illustrated that MATV has potential to improve the reconstruction of regions near tissue boundaries.</description><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Li Guo, Yingjie Mei, Jijing Guan, Xiangliang Tan, Yikai Xu, Wufan Chen, Qianjin Feng, Yanqiu Feng&lt;/p&gt;

The largest differences in intraspecific head shape among the &lt;i&gt;Carnivora&lt;/i&gt; order are to be found in dogs. Based on their skull morphotypes, dog breeds are currently classified as dolichocephalic, mesaticephalic and brachycephalic. Due to the fact that some breeds have not been yet defined, this classification is incomplete; moreover, multi-breed studies on the skull morphology of puppies have never been performed. The aim of this work was to verify (i) whether differences in the skull conformation of purebred puppies are already present within the first week of age; (ii) whether radiographic and anatomic measures could be considered interchangeable, and (iii) to possibly classify puppies from non-categorized breeds thanks to their radiographic cranial measurements using neural nets. One hundred and thirty-seven dead puppies aged 0–7 days were examined considering their anatomic and radiographic measures. All linear measures and anatomic indices significantly differed among brachycephalic and non-brachycephalic puppies.

MiRNA molecules are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the brain function. Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of Aβ in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ, and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</description><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Higaki, Masashi Muramatsu, Akio Matsuda, Kenji Matsumoto, Jun-ichi Satoh, Makoto Michikawa, Shumpei Niida&lt;/p&gt;

To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525813200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196929</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196929</canonicalUrl><author><name>Sayuri Higaki</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475056:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>21</engagement><author><name>Bernd Kärcher</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04068-0</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Formation and radiative forcing of contrail cirrus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formation and radiative forcing of contrail cirrus, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04068-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04068-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Condensation trails produced by jet aircraft contribute to anthropogenic climate change, yet the magnitude of their impact remains unclear.

However, training complex deep neural nets requires large-scale datasets labeled with ground truth, which are often unavailable in many medical image domains. For instance, to train a deep neural net to detect pulmonary nodules in lung computed tomography (CT) images, current practice is to manually label nodule locations and sizes in many CT images to construct a sufficiently large training dataset, which is costly and difficult to scale. On the other hand, electronic medical records (EMR) contain plenty of partial information on the content of each medical image. In this work, we explore how to tap this vast, but currently unexplored data source to improve pulmonary nodule detection. We propose DeepEM, a novel deep 3D ConvNet framework augmented with expectation-maximization (EM), to mine weakly supervised labels in EMRs for pulmonary nodule detection. Experimental results show that DeepEM can lead to 1.5\% and 3.9\% average improvement in free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) scores on LUNA16 and Tianchi datasets, respectively, demonstrating the utility of incomplete information in EMRs for improving deep learning algorithms. https://github.com/uci-cbcl/DeepEM-for-Weakly-Supervised-Detection.git</description><crawled>1526334431865</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>Recently deep learning has been witnessing widespread adoption in various medical image applications.

Genome-scale metabolic models have become the tool of choice for the global analysis of microorganism metabolism, and their reconstruction has attained high standards of quality and reliability. Improvements in this area have been accompanied by the development of some major platforms and databases, and an explosion of individual bioinformatics methods. Consequently, many recent models result from “à la carte” pipelines, combining the use of platforms, individual tools and biological expertise to enhance the quality of the reconstruction. Although very useful, introducing heterogeneous tools, that hardly interact with each other, causes loss of traceability and reproducibility in the reconstruction process. This represents a real obstacle, especially when considering less studied species whose metabolic reconstruction can greatly benefit from the comparison to good quality models of related organisms. This work proposes an adaptable workspace, AuReMe, for sustainable reconstructions or improvements of genome-scale metabolic models involving personalized pipelines. At each step, relevant information related to the modifications brought to the model by a method is stored. This ensures that the process is reproducible and documented regardless of the combination of tools used. Additionally, the workspace establishes a way to browse metabolic models and their metadata through the automatic generation of ad-hoc local wikis dedicated to monitoring and facilitating the process of reconstruction. AuReMe supports exploration and semantic query based on RDF databases. We illustrate how this workspace allowed handling, in an integrated way, the metabolic reconstructions of non-model organisms such as an extremophile bacterium or eukaryote algae. Among relevant applications, the latter reconstruction led to putative evolutionary insights of a metabolic pathway.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oV3GF0mvv-g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006146</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/oV3GF0mvv-g/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Traceability, reproducibility and wiki-exploration for “à-la-carte” reconstructions of genome-scale metabolic models</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><crawled>1527098195054</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Méziane Aite, Marie Chevallier, Clémence Frioux, Camille Trottier, Jeanne Got, María Paz Cortés, Sebastián N.

Background &lt;p&gt;Quality of obstetric care may not be constant within clinics and hospitals. Night shifts and weekends experience understaffing and other organizational hurdles in comparison with the weekday morning shifts, and this may influence the risk of maternal deaths.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To analyze the hourly variation of maternal mortality within Mexican health institutions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a cross-sectional multivariate analysis of 3,908 maternal deaths and 10,589,444 births that occurred within health facilities in Mexico during the 2010–2014 period, using data from the Health Information Systems of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We fitted negative binomial regression models with covariate adjustment to all data, as well as similar models by basic cause of death and by weekdays/weekends. The outcome was the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), defined as the number of deaths occurred per 100,000 live births. Hour of day was the main predictor; covariates were day of the week, c-section, marginalization, age, education, and number of pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Risk rises during early morning, reaching 52.5 deaths per 100,000 live births at 6:00 (95% UI: 46.3, 62.2). This is almost twice the lowest risk, which occurred at noon (27.1 deaths per 100,000 live births [95% U.I.: 23.0, 32.0]). Risk shows peaks coinciding with shift changes, at 07:00, and 14:00 and was significantly higher on weekends and holidays.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests strong hourly fluctuations in the risk of maternal death with during early morning hours and around the afternoon shift change.

The faculty of language is thought to be uniquely human. Recently, it has been claimed that songbirds are able to associate meaning with sound, comparable to the way that humans do. In human language, the meaning of expressions (semantics) is dependent on a mind-internal hierarchical structure (syntax). Meaning is associated with structure through the principle of compositionality, whereby the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meaning of its constituent parts and the mode of composition. We argue that while recent experimental findings on songbird call sequences offer exciting novel insights into animal communication, despite claims to the contrary, they are quite unlike what we find in human language. There are indeed remarkable behavioral and neural parallels in auditory-vocal imitation learning between songbirds and human infants that are absent in our closest evolutionary relatives, the great apes. But so far, there is no convincing evidence of syntax-determined meaning in nonhuman animals.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iFTIxhJ_hsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005157</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/iFTIxhJ_hsk/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Meaningful syntactic structure in songbird vocalizations?</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><crawled>1528135076702</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Johan J.

By means of such process, which occurs at a microscopic scale, worn out bone is replaced by new, fully functional one. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously and independently throughout the body, so the whole skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years. Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types; some are specialized in destroying old bone, whereas others produce new bone to replace the former. The whole process is tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced exactly balances that of old one removed and bone microscopic structure is maintained. To date, many regulatory molecules involved in bone remodeling have been identified, but the precise mechanism of BMU operation remains to be fully elucidated. Given the complexity of the signaling pathways already known, the question arises of ascertaining whether such complexity is an inherent requirement of the process, or a consequence of operational redundancy. In this work we propose a minimal model of BMU function which involves a small number of signals and accounts for fully functional BMU operation. Our main assumptions are i) at any given time, any cell within a BMU can select only one among a reduced choice of decisions: divide, die, migrate or differentiate, ii) such decision is irreversibly determined by depletion of an appropriate internal inhibitor and iii) the dynamics of any such inhibitor is coupled to that of a few external mediators. It is shown that efficient BMU operation then unfolds as an emergent property, which results from individual decisions taken by cells in the BMU unit in the absence of any external planning.</description><crawled>1525955122960</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>Human skeleton undergoes constant remodeling during the whole life.

We previously identified brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a source of sleep-inducing signals. Pharmacological activation of BAT enhances sleep while sleep loss leads to increased BAT thermogenesis. Recovery sleep after sleep loss is diminished in mice that lack uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), and also in wild-type (WT) mice after sensory denervation of the BAT. Systemic inflammation greatly affects metabolism and the function of adipose tissue, and also induces characteristic sleep responses. We hypothesized that sleep responses to acute inflammation are mediated by BAT-derived signals. To test this, we determined the effects of systemic inflammation on sleep and body temperature in UCP-1 knockout (KO) and WT mice. Intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 beta and clodronate containing liposomes were used to induce systemic inflammation. In WT animals, non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) was elevated in all four inflammatory models. All NREMS responses were completely abolished in UCP-1 KO animals. Systemic inflammation elicited an initial hypothermia followed by fever in WT mice. The hypothermic phase, but not the fever, was abolished in UCP-1 KO mice.

We previously identified brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a source of sleep-inducing signals. Pharmacological activation of BAT enhances sleep while sleep loss leads to increased BAT thermogenesis. Recovery sleep after sleep loss is diminished in mice that lack uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), and also in wild-type (WT) mice after sensory denervation of the BAT. Systemic inflammation greatly affects metabolism and the function of adipose tissue, and also induces characteristic sleep responses. We hypothesized that sleep responses to acute inflammation are mediated by BAT-derived signals. To test this, we determined the effects of systemic inflammation on sleep and body temperature in UCP-1 knockout (KO) and WT mice. Intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 beta and clodronate containing liposomes were used to induce systemic inflammation. In WT animals, non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) was elevated in all four inflammatory models. All NREMS responses were completely abolished in UCP-1 KO animals. Systemic inflammation elicited an initial hypothermia followed by fever in WT mice. The hypothermic phase, but not the fever, was abolished in UCP-1 KO mice. The only recognized function of UCP-1 is to promote thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Present results indicate that the presence of UCP-1 is necessary for increased NREMS but does not contribute to the development of fever in systemic inflammation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197409</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197409</canonicalUrl><author><name>Éva Szentirmai</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0f0:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198354</originId><updated>1528146000000</updated><description>&lt;p&gt;by Neha R.

T cell recognition of peptides presented within self-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules is essential for long-lived protective immunity. As mice age the number of naïve CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells declines. However, unlike for CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, there are more naïve and memory phenotype CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells that bind foreign pMHCII in old mice (18–22 months) than adults (12–15 weeks), suggesting increased promiscuity of pMHCII recognition with aging. Here we asked if CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses to immunization or infection increase with aging since the magnitude of a CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell response to a foreign pMHCII is proportional to the size of the precursor population in adult mice. We observed no difference in the number of pMHCII-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in adult versus old mice for pooled secondary lymphoid organs after immunization, bacterial infection, or viral infection, but we did observe diminished numbers of pMHCII-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in both the draining lymph node and brain of old mice after West Nile virus infection. These data indicate that an increased precursor frequency does not translate into more robust responses upon immunization or infection in old mice.</description><fingerprint>63e3ce03</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198354</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>A disconnect between precursor frequency, expansion potential, and site-specific CD4&amp;lt;sup&gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses in aged mice</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Neha R.

Biodiversity loss in riparian forests has the potential to alter rates of leaf litter decomposition in stream ecosystems. However, studies have reported the full range of positive, negative and no effects of plant diversity loss on decomposition, and there is currently no explanation for such inconsistent results. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether plant diversity loss affects other ecological processes related to decomposition, such as fine particulate organic matter production or detritivore growth, which precludes a thorough understanding of how detrital stream food webs are impacted by plant diversity loss.

Biodiversity loss in riparian forests has the potential to alter rates of leaf litter decomposition in stream ecosystems. However, studies have reported the full range of positive, negative and no effects of plant diversity loss on decomposition, and there is currently no explanation for such inconsistent results. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether plant diversity loss affects other ecological processes related to decomposition, such as fine particulate organic matter production or detritivore growth, which precludes a thorough understanding of how detrital stream food webs are impacted by plant diversity loss. We used a microcosm experiment to examine the effects of plant diversity loss on litter decomposition, fine particulate organic matter production, and growth of a dominant leaf-shredding detritivore, using litter mixtures varying in species composition. We hypothesized that plant diversity loss would decrease the rates of all studied processes, but such effects would depend on the leaf traits present in litter mixtures (both their average values and their variability). Our findings partly supported our hypotheses, showing that plant diversity loss had a consistently negative effect on litter decomposition and fine particulate organic matter production (but not on detritivore growth) across litter mixtures, which was mediated by detritivores. Importantly, the magnitude of the diversity effect and the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying this effect (i.e., complementarity vs. selection) varied depending on the species composition of litter mixtures, mainly because of differences in litter nutritional quality and trait variability. Complementarity was prevalent but varied in size, with positive selection effects also occurring in some mixtures. Our results support the notion that loss of riparian plant species is detrimental to key stream ecosystem processes that drive detrital food webs, but that the magnitude of such effects largely depends on the the order of species loss.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527627600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198243</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198243</canonicalUrl><author><name>Naiara López-Rojo</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c2e:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Li, A.</name></author><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323964v1?rss=1</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>da9bf896</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323964v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>The Carcinogenome Project: In-vitro Gene Expression Profiling of Chemical Perturbations to Predict Long-Term Carcinogenicity [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323964v1?rss=1</link><description>Most chemicals in commerce have not been evaluated for their carcinogenic potential.

Our analysis showed that chemical bioactivity, as measured by the strength and reproducibility of the transcriptional response, is not significantly associated with long-term carcinogenicity, as evidenced by the many carcinogenic chemicals that did not elicit substantial changes in gene expression at doses up to 40 uM.

We spend a lot of time thinking about proteins in terms of their primary sequence and features of their three-dimensional structure (binding pockets, recognition domains, etc.) And that’s understandable. But it’s always important not to lose sight of the fact that the surfaces of proteins are decorated with all kinds of ornaments that are vital for their function, even if they’re synthetically hard to control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief among those are phosphates, you’d have to say. Kinases, of course, phosphorylate things and phosphatases take those back off (and as is often the case in biology, those two classes of enzymes are rather unbalanced: there are a lot more specific kinases out there, compared to a relatively small number of jack-of-all-trades phosphatases). Phosphorylation state can be a powerful on/off switch on specific protein residues, but it’s worth remembering that proteins can have a whole long list of phosphoryation sites once you get past the heavy-duty ones. The number of kinase inhibitors out there is proof enough that this method of regulating protein function can be taken advantage of, but it’s worth keeping in mind that making specifically phosphorylated proteins can be a painful process if you don’t have a living cell or at least a tame enzyme to do it for you. That’s particularly true if you’re interested in one of the less-common phosphorylation sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have a very different sort of polarity modification, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenylation&quot;&gt;prenylation&lt;/a&gt;. Farnesyl (or geranyl-geranyl) groups are small lipophilic chains that get attached to proteins to modify their function and/or cellular localization. Proteins also get decorated with even longer lipid chains via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitoylation&quot;&gt;palmitoylation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myristoylation&quot;&gt;myristoylation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s believed that these are generally involved in localizing things to membrane sites (as those greasy side chains settle into the lipid membrane). What’s for sure is that these modifications can make proteins rather tricky to work with (as is generally the case when you have a big polar/nonpolar structural separation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that you get to the proteins-modified-with-other-proteins class, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin&quot;&gt;ubiquitination&lt;/a&gt; at the head of that class. Ubiquitin, as the name implies, is all over the place, and proteins get ubiquitinated (at lysine residues) to mark them for degradation, to mark them not to be degraded, to change their localization and interaction networks, and for who knows what else. It’s a huge topic, since there are lots of varieties of ubiquitin attachment, and if you think we’ve got them all figured out you are sadly mistaken. Then there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUMO_protein&quot;&gt;SUMOylation&lt;/a&gt;, another add-a-small-protein process that’s clearly important but which we understand even less. It’s less common than ubiquitination (we think!), but there are several different sorts of SUMO proteins and places that they can be attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m skipping over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification&quot;&gt;several other&lt;/a&gt; post-translational modifications to get to a big class of them that I haven’t mentioned yet: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation&quot;&gt;glycosylations&lt;/a&gt;. Sugar molecules (and chains of them) are stapled on to residues like tyrosine, starting with good old glucose and going on from there. These things can also be linked through amine and sometimes even SH residues, and that is just the beginning. I did my graduate work using carbohydrates as starting materials for organic synthesis, and anyone who’s worked with them will have some appreciation of the complications that are available. With all those open hydroxyls available, carbohydrates have a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside&quot;&gt;linking possibilities&lt;/a&gt; (some more common than others, naturally), and you have the alpha/beta anomeric centers for variety as well. Two naturally occurring amino acids can give you four peptides, but two naturally occurring sugars can give you a whole lot more disaccharides, at least in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modifications are hugely important in proteins and many other biomolecules (including small-molecule natural products), but when I was in grad school, a lot of this was, chemically and biologically speaking, dark matter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK453015/&quot;&gt;A lot of it&lt;/a&gt; still is. Sometimes people would prefer just to ignor that part – even now, you’ll see total syntheses of some natural product as “whateverol aglycon”, that is, minus those pesky sugars. And when it comes to proteins, you almost have to rely on a living cell to glycosylate them properly, because chemically it can be a beast. A lot of chemical glycosylations are variations on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koenigs%E2%80%93Knorr_reaction&quot;&gt;Koenigs-Knorr&lt;/a&gt; reaction, with glycosyl halides, pseudohalides, and other leaving groups, and the number of variations on this is surely beyond counting. Holy cow, are there ever a lot of attempts to make glycosylation a better and more predictable reaction. My old “Lowe’s Laws of the Lab List” had one that went “&lt;em&gt;When there are twenty different ways of running a reaction in the literature, it means that there is no good way to run the reaction&lt;/em&gt;“, and the Koenigs-Knorr was what I had in mind. But it’s true: every time you vary the substrate being glycosylated or mess with the structure of the sugar part in any way, you can expect to see a new mixture of alpha/beta glycosides at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper I linked to so many paragraphs ago is a good shot, though, at taming this stuff for plain glucose-style glycosylation. The authors have a glycosyl fluoride protocol worked out (calcium hydroxide turns out to be a key addition) that seems to give pretty solid results on tyrosines (and phenols in general). What’s really impressive is that it works under aqueous conditions, using an unprotected sugar, and works on native (unprotected) proteins and peptides. It’s not perfect – you still get some glycosylation on other residues (serine, etc.), but it’s certainly the best I’ve ever seen. It would be interesting to see what happens when you try it on a protein with several possible tyrosines or with competing Cys residues, and I get the impression that the authors are heading there next. But even as it stands, this looks like a significantly better option than anything else out there for fast one-step glycosylation without messing around with protecting groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sorts of tools that are available for synthesizing, manipulating, and analyzing proteins and nucleic acids are (in general) just not available for carbohydrates. They either don’t exist anywhere or haven’t been domesticated from their biochemical forms. Only in recent years has the dream of automated polysaccharide synthesis come close &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/17/E3385&quot;&gt;to reality&lt;/a&gt;. Even in this paper, it’s worth noting that the authors weren’t really able to tell what all those other minor glycosylated side products were; it would be a major effort to run all those down. But this stuff is important, and every new technique that makes it easier to work in the area is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525699324000</published><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/07/stop-ignoring-the-sugars</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><recrawled>1525699957504</recrawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_1633ac759bf:282cdaa:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><keywords><item>Sustainability Science</item></keywords><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5314.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5314</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>21f8de54</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5314.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Uncertainty in long-run forecasts of quantities such as per capita gross domestic product [Economic Sciences]</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><description>People make predictions about the future all of the time.

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</description><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;

To examine the 20-year trends in the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity among children aged 0–6 years between 1995 and 2015 in Harbin, China, we selected altogether 49,553 children aged 0–6 years old by using a multistage stratified cluster sampling methods in Harbin, one provincial capital city in northeast China in 1995, 2005 and 2015. Height and weight information of the children were collected. We used the child growth standards of World Health Organization to calculate the Z-scores for body mass index (BMI). Cut-offs recommended by World Health Organization and International Obesity Task Force were used to define overweight and obesity for each children. We found there is no difference between boys’ BMI and girls’ among newborns in each survey point (p&gt;0.05), but in older age groups, the BMI of boys was higher than that of girls (p&amp;lt;0.05). From 1995 to 2015, the average BMI was increasing continuously among boys older than 42 months and girls older than 48 months (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for linear trend across year) in Harbin. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 2.6% in 1995 to 7.6% in 2015. For every 10-year the risk of combined overweight and obesity in children aged 0–6 years increased by 167% (95%CI: 146%, 188%, p&amp;lt;0.01). The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in most age subgroups showed an increasing trend over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for trend test across survey year). The age when the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity dramatically increased was earlier in 2015 than that in 2005 and 1995. In conclusion, there was an increasing trend of the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity during the past 20 years in Harbin and the age when the prevalence dramatically increased became earlier. Comprehensive intervention should be undertaken among younger children to prevent and control children’s overweight and obesity.</description><fingerprint>1370fb6f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198032</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>20-year trends in prevalence of overweight and obesity among children aged 0-6 in Harbin, China: A multiple cross-sectional study</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Liu, Qin Li, Hui Li, Jia Li, Hai-Jun Wang, Bin Li&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is generally considered as a mild exanthematous disease to infants and young children worldwide. HFMD cases are usually mild and self-limiting but for few cases leads to complicated severe clinical outcomes, and even death. Previous studies have indicated that serum Ang II levels in patients with H7N9 infection were related to the severity of infection. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe HFMD remain unclear. This study was undertaken to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the progression of severe HFMD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the present study, 162 children including HFMD patients and healthy controls were recruited. The data was analyzed by time-series fashion. Concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) and noradrenaline (NA) in serum of patients were measured with ELISA. We established a mouse model for enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection and determined concentrations of Ang II, NA in tissue lysates at 3, 5 and 7 days post infection (dpi).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of the HFMD patients with mild or severe symptoms were significantly higher than that in healthy controls.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is generally considered as a mild exanthematous disease to infants and young children worldwide. HFMD cases are usually mild and self-limiting but for few cases leads to complicated severe clinical outcomes, and even death. Previous studies have indicated that serum Ang II levels in patients with H7N9 infection were related to the severity of infection. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe HFMD remain unclear. This study was undertaken to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the progression of severe HFMD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the present study, 162 children including HFMD patients and healthy controls were recruited. The data was analyzed by time-series fashion. Concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) and noradrenaline (NA) in serum of patients were measured with ELISA. We established a mouse model for enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection and determined concentrations of Ang II, NA in tissue lysates at 3, 5 and 7 days post infection (dpi).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of the HFMD patients with mild or severe symptoms were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. Additionally, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of severe cases were significantly higher than those mild cases and the increased concentrations of Ang II and NA showed the same time trend during the progression of HFMD in the severe cases. Furthermore, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in target organs of EV71-infected mice including brains, skeletal muscle, and lungs were increased with the progression of EV71 infection in mice. Histopathological alterations were observed in the brains, skeletal muscle and lungs of EV71-infected mice.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study suggested that activation of the RAS is implicated in the pathogenesis of severe HFMD.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527109200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197861</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197861</canonicalUrl><author><name>Chao Zhang</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f233c:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>43</engagement><updated>1527627600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006162</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Skerritt-Davis, Mounya Elhilali&lt;/p&gt;
Our ability to parse our acoustic environment relies on the brain’s capacity to extract statistical regularities from surrounding sounds. Previous work in regularity extraction has predominantly focused on the brain’s sensitivity to predictable patterns in sound sequences. However, natural sound environments are rarely completely predictable, often containing some level of randomness, yet the brain is able to effectively interpret its surroundings by extracting useful information from stochastic sounds. It has been previously shown that the brain is sensitive to the marginal lower-order statistics of sound sequences (i.e., mean and variance). In this work, we investigate the brain’s sensitivity to higher-order statistics describing temporal dependencies between sound events through a series of change detection experiments, where listeners are asked to detect changes in randomness in the pitch of tone sequences. Behavioral data indicate listeners collect statistical estimates to process incoming sounds, and a perceptual model based on Bayesian inference shows a capacity in the brain to track higher-order statistics. Further analysis of individual subjects’ behavior indicates an important role of perceptual constraints in listeners’ ability to track these sensory statistics with high fidelity. In addition, the inference model facilitates analysis of neural electroencephalography (EEG) responses, anchoring the analysis relative to the statistics of each stochastic stimulus. This reveals both a deviance response and a change-related disruption in phase of the stimulus-locked response that follow the higher-order statistics. These results shed light on the brain’s ability to process stochastic sound sequences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ROlsYNEAxXQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006162</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ROlsYNEAxXQ/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Detecting change in stochastic sound sequences</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><crawled>1527615681306</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Skerritt-Davis, Mounya Elhilali&lt;/p&gt;

Measuring red blood cell (RBC) deformability has become important for clinical disease diagnostics. Various methods for measuring RBC deformability have been developed; however, they require costly and large instruments, long measuring time, and skilled personnel. In this study, we present a three-dimensional-printed mini-disk (3D-PMD) for measuring RBC deformability to overcome the previous limitations. For a miniaturized and low-cost setup, the 3D-PMD was fabricated by a 3D printing technique, which had not yet been used for fabricating a lab-on-a-compact disk (LOCD). Using a 3D printing technique, a multi-layered fluidic channel on the mini CD could be fabricated easily. During rotation by a spinning motor, the difference of the length of compressed RBCs in the fluidic channel was measured and analysed as compressibility indices (CIs) of normal and glutaraldehyde-treated hardened RBCs. The rotation speed and time were decided as 3000 rpm and 30 min, respectively, at which the difference of CI values between normal and hardened RBCs was largest (CI&lt;sub&gt;normal&lt;/sub&gt;-CI&lt;sub&gt;hardened&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.195).</description><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunjung Lim, Seung Min Back, Jeonghun Nam, Hyuk Choi&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether stopping the effective antibiotic treatment following clinical improvement at Day 7 (Truncated treatment) would be non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 (Continued treatment) in patients with acute pyelonephritis (APN) requiring hospitalization treated with non-fluoroquinolone (non-FQ) antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Hospitalized adult men and non-pregnant women with culture-confirmed APN were eligible for participation after they had clinically improved following empirical or culture-guided treatment with intravenous non-FQ antibiotic(s). We excluded patients with severe sepsis, abscesses, prostatitis, recurrent or catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or urinary tract obstruction. We randomized eligible patients on Day 7 of effective treatment and assessed them at Weeks 1 and 6 after treatment completion. The primary outcome was retreatment for recurrent urinary tract infection. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 15%.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 17, 2015 and August 22, 2016, we randomly allocated 54 patients—27 patients in each arm. Twenty-four (44%) patients were male, and 26 (48%) had diabetes mellitus. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was the most common urinary isolate (47 [87%] patients); 36 (78%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In all, 41 (76%) patients received amikacin-based treatment. At the end of 6 weeks, no patient in the truncated treatment arm required retreatment, whereas 1 patient in the continued treatment arm was retreated. Difference (90% CI) in retreatment was −3.7% (−15.01% to 6.15%). Upper bound of the difference (6.15%) was below the prespecified limit, establishing non-inferiority of truncated treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria at Week 6 was similar between the two arms (3/24 vs. 3/26; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.0). Patients in the truncated treatment arm had significantly shorter hospital stay (8 [7–10] vs. 14 [14–15] days; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and less antibiotic consumption per patient (8.4 ± 2.8 vs. 17.4 ± 8.3 DDDs; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Stopping the effective non-FQ antibiotics following clinical improvement at Day 7 is non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 in selected patients with APN requiring hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;Clinical Trials Registry-India; CTRI/2016/04/006810.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pavankumar Rudrabhatla, Surendran Deepanjali, Jharna Mandal, Rathinam Palamalai Swaminathan, Tamilarasu Kadhiravan&lt;/p&gt;

However, because of the variability of this gene, it has been difficult to design good universal PCR primers. Most primers used today are associated with gaps in the taxonomic coverage or amplification biases that make the results less reliable and impede the detection of species that are present in the sample. We identify new primers for insect metabarcoding using computational approaches (ECOPRIMERS and DEGEPRIME) applied to the most comprehensive reference databases of mitochondrial genomes of Hexapoda assembled to date. New primers are evaluated in silico against previously published primers in terms of taxonomic coverage and resolution of the corresponding amplicons. For the latter criterion, we propose a new index, exclusive taxonomic resolution, which is a more biologically meaningful measure than the standard index used today. Our results show that the best markers are found in the ribosomal RNA genes (12S and 16S); they resolve about 90% of the genetically distinct species in the reference database. Some markers in protein-coding genes provide similar performance but only at much higher levels of primer degeneracy. Combining two of the best individual markers improves the effective taxonomic resolution with up to 10%. The resolution is strongly dependent on insect taxon: COI primers detect 40% of Hymenoptera, while 12S primers detect 12% of Collembola.

Bayesian phylogenetic approaches can take advantage of these data by simultaneously inferring the phylogenetic tree, evolutionary timescale, and demographic parameters (such as population growth rates), while naturally integrating uncertainty in all parameters. Despite their desirable properties, Bayesian approaches can be computationally intensive, hindering their use for outbreak investigations involving genome data for a large numbers of pathogen isolates. An alternative to using full Bayesian inference is to use a hybrid approach, where the phylogenetic tree and evolutionary timescale are estimated first using maximum likelihood. Under this hybrid approach, demographic parameters are inferred from estimated trees instead of the sequence data, using maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, or approximate Bayesian computation. This can vastly reduce the computational burden, but has the disadvantage of ignoring the uncertainty in the phylogenetic tree and evolutionary timescale. Results: We compared the performance of a fully Bayesian and a hybrid method by analysing six whole-genome SNP data sets from a range of bacteria and simulations. The estimates from the two methods were very similar, suggesting that the hybrid method is a valid alternative for very large datasets. However, we also found that congruence between these methods is contingent on the presence of strong temporal structure in the data (i.e. clocklike behaviour), which is typically verified using a date-randomisation test in a Bayesian framework. To reduce the computational burden of this Bayesian test we implemented a date-randomisation test using a rapid maximum likelihood method, which has similar performance to its Bayesian counterpart. Conclusions: Hybrid approaches can produce reliable inferences of evolutionary timescales and phylodynamic parameters in a fraction of the time required for fully Bayesian analyses. As such, they are a valuable alternative in outbreak studies involving a large number of isolates.</description><crawled>1528140607748</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>Background: Recent developments in sequencing technologies make it possible to obtain genome sequences from a large number of isolates in a very short time.

However, we also found that congruence between these methods is contingent on the presence of strong temporal structure in the data (i.e. clocklike behaviour), which is typically verified using a date-randomisation test in a Bayesian framework. To reduce the computational burden of this Bayesian test we implemented a date-randomisation test using a rapid maximum likelihood method, which has similar performance to its Bayesian counterpart. Conclusions: Hybrid approaches can produce reliable inferences of evolutionary timescales and phylodynamic parameters in a fraction of the time required for fully Bayesian analyses. As such, they are a valuable alternative in outbreak studies involving a large number of isolates.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528095600000</published><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/04/190041</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163cc473104:4e35ece:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197791</originId><updated>1526590800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197791</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>bfaafc70</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197791</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Correction: What matters to women during childbirth: A systematic qualitative review</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Soo Downe, Kenneth Finlayson, Olufemi T.

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation.</description><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christi Patten, James Levine, Ioannis Pavlidis, Joyce Balls-Berry, Arya Shah, Christine Hughes, Tabetha Brockman, Miguel Valdez Soto, Daniel Witt, Gabriel Koepp, Pamela Sinicrope, Jamie Richards&lt;/p&gt;

Stressor-exposure has been shown to exacerbate inflammation and change the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota; however stressor-induced effects on microbiota-derived metabolites and their receptors are unknown. Thus, bacterial-produced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as microbial community composition, were assessed in the colons of mice exposed to stress during infection with &lt;i&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/i&gt;. Mice were exposed to overnight restraint on 7 consecutive nights, or left undisturbed as a control. After the first exposure of restraint, mice were orally challenged with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt; or with vehicle. Microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SCFA levels measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Pathogen levels and colonic inflammation were also assessed 6 days post-infection. Results demonstrated that the microbial community structure and SCFA production were significantly affected by both stressor exposure and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt;-infection. Exposure to prolonged restraint in the absence of infection significantly reduced SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid). Multiple bacterial taxa were affected by stressor exposure, with the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; being significantly reduced and directly correlated with propionic acid. &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; abundances were inversely correlated with colonic inflammation, supporting the contention that &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; helps to regulate mucosal inflammatory responses.

Feature selection is intended to preserve biologically relevant information while removing genes only subject to technical noise. As it is frequently performed prior to dimensionality reduction, clustering and pseudotime analyses, feature selection can have a major impact on the results. Several different approaches have been proposed for unsupervised feature selection from unprocessed single-cell expression matrices, most based upon identifying highly variable genes in the dataset. We present two methods which take advantage of the prevalence of zeros (dropouts) in scRNASeq data to identify features. We show that dropout-based feature selection outperforms variance-based feature selection for multiple applications of single-cell RNASeq.</description><crawled>1526582366413</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>Features selection is a key step in many single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) analyses. Feature selection is intended to preserve biologically relevant information while removing genes only subject to technical noise. As it is frequently performed prior to dimensionality reduction, clustering and pseudotime analyses, feature selection can have a major impact on the results.

In the 5‐step carboxylase reaction, the substrate Ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate (RuBP) first binds Rubisco and undergoes enolization before binding the second substrate, CO2. Hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex is followed by CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation.

Large‐scale computations on active‐site models provide a means to better understand this complex chemical mechanism. The computational protocol comprises a combination of hybrid semi‐empirical quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics within constrained molecular dynamics simulations, together with constrained gradient minimization calculations using density functional theory. Alternative pathways for hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex and associated active‐site protonation networks and proton and water sources were investigated. The main findings from analysis of the resulting energetics advocate major revision to existing mechanisms such that: hydration takes place anti to the CO2; both hydration and CC bond scission require early protonation of CO2 in the RuBP.CO2 complex; CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation reactions are concerted and, effectively, there is only one stable intermediate, the C3‐gemdiolate complex. Our main conclusions for interpreting enzyme kinetic results are that the gemdiolate may represent the elusive Michaelis–Menten‐like complex corresponding to the empirical Km (=Kc) with turnover to product via bond scission concerted with stereospecific protonation consistent with the observed catalytic rate. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><author><name>Peter L.Cummins

Background &lt;p&gt;We sought to develop a novel risk assessment tool to predict the clinical outcomes after heat-related illness.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Prospective, multicenter observational study. Patients who transferred to emergency hospitals in Japan with heat-related illness were registered. The sample was divided into two parts: 60% to construct the score and 40% to validate it. A binary logistic regression model was used to predict hospital admission as a primary outcome. The resulting model was transformed into a scoring system.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 3,001 eligible patients were analyzed. There was no difference in variables between development and validation cohorts. Based on the result of a logistic regression model in the development phase (n = 1,805), the J-ERATO score was defined as the sum of the six binary components in the prehospital setting (respiratory rate≥22 /min, Glasgow coma scale&amp;lt;15, systolic blood pressure≤100 mmHg, heart rate≥100 bpm, body temperature≥38°C, and age≥65 y), for a total score ranging from 0 to 6. In the validation phase (n = 1,196), the score had excellent discrimination (C-statistic 0.84; 95% CI 0.79–0.89, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and calibration (P&gt;0.2 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The observed proportion of hospital admission increased with increasing J-ERATO score (score = 0, 5.0%; score = 1, 15.0%; score = 2, 24.6%; score = 3, 38.6%; score = 4, 68.0%; score = 5, 85.2%; score = 6, 96.4%). Multivariate analyses showed that the J-ERATO score was an independent positive predictor of hospital admission (adjusted OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.06–2.87; P&amp;lt;0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (3.73; 2.95–4.72; P&amp;lt;0.001) and in-hospital mortality (1.65; 1.18–2.32; P = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The J-ERATO score is simply assessed and can facilitate the identification of patients with higher risk of heat-related hospitalization. This scoring system is also significantly associated with the higher likelihood of ICU admission and in-hospital mortality after heat-related hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kei Hayashida, Yutaka Kondo, Toru Hifumi, Junya Shimazaki, Yasutaka Oda, Shinichiro Shiraishi, Tatsuma Fukuda, Junichi Sasaki, Keiki Shimizu&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To compare the relative changes in muscle-tendon complex (MTC) properties following high load resistance training (RT) in young males and females, and determine any link with circulating TGFβ-1 and IGF-I levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight participants were assigned to a training group and subdivided by sex (T males [TM] aged 20±1 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, T females [TF] aged 19±3 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8), whilst age-matched 6 males and 6 females were assigned to control groups (ConM/F). The training groups completed 8 weeks of resistance training (RT). MTC properties (Vastus Lateralis, VL) physiological cross-sectional area (pCSA), quadriceps torque, patella tendon stiffness [K], Young’s modulus, volume, cross-sectional area, and length, circulating levels of TGFβ-1 and IGF-I were assessed at baseline and post RT.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Post RT, there was a significant increase in the mechanical and morphological properties of the MTC in both training groups, compared to ConM/F (p&amp;lt;0.001). However, there were no significant sex-specific changes in most MTC variables. There were however significant sex differences in changes in K, with females exhibiting greater changes than males at lower MVC (Maximal Voluntary Contraction) force levels (10% p = 0.030 &amp;amp; 20% MVC p = 0.032) and the opposite effect seen at higher force levels (90% p = 0.040 &amp;amp; 100% MVC p = 0.044). There were significant increases (p&amp;lt;0.05) in IGF-I in both TF and TM following training, with no change in TGFβ-1. There were no gender differences (p&gt;0.05) in IGF-I or TGFβ-1. Interestingly, pooled population data showed that TGFβ-1 correlated with K at baseline, with no correlations identified between IGF-I and MTC properties.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Greater resting TGFβ-1 levels are associated with superior tendon mechanical properties. RT can impact opposite ends of the patella tendon force-elongation relationship in each sex.

The highly similar prokaryotic DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (C5-MTases) M.MpeI and M.SssI share the specificity of eukaryotic C5-MTases (5’-CG), and can be useful research tools in the study of eukaryotic DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation. In an effort to improve the stability and solubility of complementing fragments of the two MTases, genes encoding circularly permuted (CP) variants of M.MpeI and M.SssI were created, and cloned in a plasmid vector downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter. MTase activity of the CP variants was tested by digestion of the plasmids with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Eleven of the fourteen M.MpeI permutants and six of the seven M.SssI permutants had detectable MTase activity as indicated by the full or partial protection of the plasmid carrying the cpMTase gene. Permutants cp62M.MpeI and cp58M.SssI, in which the new N-termini are located between conserved motifs II and III, had by far the highest activity. The activity of cp62M.MpeI was comparable to the activity of wild-type M.MpeI. Based on the location of the split sites, the permutants possessing MTase activity can be classified in ten types. Although most permutation sites were designed to fall outside of conserved motifs, and the MTase activity of the permutants measured in cell extracts was in most cases substantially lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, the high proportion of circular permutation topologies compatible with MTase activity is remarkable, and is a new evidence for the structural plasticity of C5-MTases. A computer search of the REBASE database identified putative C5-MTases with CP arrangement. Interestingly, all natural circularly permuted C5-MTases appear to represent only one of the ten types of permutation topology created in this work.</description><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pál Albert, Bence Varga, Nikolett Zsibrita, Antal Kiss&lt;/p&gt;

Functional imaging studies of affective disorders have demonstrated abnormal activity in the amygdala in response to emotionally salient stimuli. Since in other studies this response has been shown to habituate during the scanning session, it is not clear if it may be of use in monitoring disease progression or remission, or in monitoring the effects of therapy, as habituation may confound normalisation of response. We investigated here amygdala activation in healthy participants exposed to displays of emotional facial expressions in a sample of N = 31 individuals assessed twice in an interval of three weeks. At this interval no habituation could be detected, suggesting the validity of this imaging assay in repeated assessments of amygdalar reactivity. However, the fusiform gyrus and the inferior frontal lobes showed decreases in activations that may be related to the role of these areas in encoding visual and emotional aspects of the stimuli.</description><fingerprint>62dd9867</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198244</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Repeated fMRI in measuring the activation of the amygdala without habituation when viewing faces displaying negative emotions</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Spohrs, Julia E.

This method and software called DiTaxa substitutes standard OTU-clustering or sequence-level analysis by segmenting 16S rRNA reads into the most frequent variable-length subsequences. These subsequences are then used as data representation for downstream phenotype prediction, biomarker detection and taxonomic analysis. Our proposed sequence segmentation called nucleotide-pair encoding (NPE) is an unsupervised data-driven segmentation inspired by Byte-pair encoding, a data compression algorithm. The identified subsequences represent commonly occurring sequence portions, which we found to be distinctive for taxa at varying evolutionary distances and highly informative for predicting host phenotypes. We compared the performance of DiTaxa to the state-of-the-art methods in disease phenotype prediction and biomarker detection, using human-associated 16S rRNA samples for periodontal disease, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as a synthetic benchmark dataset. DiTaxa identified 13 out of 21 taxa with confirmed links to periodontitis (recall=0.62), relative to 3 out of 21 taxa (recall=0.14) by the state-of-the-art method. On synthetic benchmark data, DiTaxa obtained full precision and recall in biomarker detection, compared to 0.91 and 0.90, respectively. In addition, machine-learning classifiers trained to predict host disease phenotypes based on the NPE representation performed competitively to the state-of-the art using OTUs or k-mers. For the rheumatoid arthritis dataset, DiTaxa substantially outperformed OTU features with a macro-F1 score of 0.76 compared to 0.65. Due to the alignment- and reference free nature, DiTaxa can efficiently run on large datasets. The full analysis of a large 16S rRNA dataset of 1359 samples required ~1.5 hours on 20 cores, while the standard pipeline needed ~6.5 hours in the same setting.

Using cultivar resistance against pathogens is one of the most economical and environmentally friendly methods for control of crop diseases. However, cultivar resistance can be easily rendered ineffective due to changes in pathogen populations or environments. To test the hypothesis that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistance and quantitative resistance (QR) in one cultivar can provide more effective resistance than use of either type of resistance on its own, effectiveness of resistance in eight oilseed rape (&lt;i&gt;Brassica napus&lt;/i&gt;) cultivars with different &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR against &lt;i&gt;Leptosphaeria maculans&lt;/i&gt; (phoma stem canker) was investigated in 13 different environments/sites over three growing seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013). Cultivar Drakkar with no &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and no QR was used as susceptible control and for sampling &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations. Isolates of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; were obtained from the 13 sites in 2010/2011 to assess frequencies of avirulent alleles of different effector genes (&lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt;) corresponding to the resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;) used in the field experiments. Results of field experiments showed that cultivars DK Cabernet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; + QR) and Adriana (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had significantly less severe phoma stem canker than cultivars Capitol (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;) and Bilbao (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt;), respectively. Results of controlled environment experiments confirmed the presence of &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR in these four cultivars. Analysis of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations from different sites showed that the mean frequencies of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt; (10%) and &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; (41%) were less than that of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt; (100%), suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistances were partially rendered ineffective while &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; resistance was still effective. Cultivar Excel (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had less severe canker than cultivar Roxet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;), but the difference between them was not significant due to influence of the effective resistance gene &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;. For the two cultivars with only QR, Es-Astrid (QR) had less severe stem canker than NK Grandia (QR). Analysis of the relationship between severity of stem canker and weather data among the 13 sites in the three growing seasons showed that increased severity of stem canker was associated with increased rainfall during the phoma leaf spot development stage and increased temperature during the stem canker development stage. Further analysis of cultivar response to environmental factors showed that cultivars with both an &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR (e.g. DK Cabernet, Adriana and Excel) were less sensitive to a change in environment than cultivars with only &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes (e.g. Capitol, Bilbao) or only QR (e.g. DK Grandia). These results suggest that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR can provide effective, stable control of phoma stem canker in different environments.</description><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yong-Ju Huang, Georgia K.

Pomegranate fruit consumption has increased rapidly throughout the world, mainly because of its medical and nutritive attributes. Thus, considerable commercial and scientific interest exists in prolonging its postharvest life with non-chemical applications as much as possible to meet the year-round demand for this fruit. The present work aimed to study the effects of black seed oil (0.1% and 0.5%), propolis (0.01% and 0.1%) and fludioxonil (0.06%), with and without modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), on the postharvest quality of pomegranate cv. Wonderful. Treated fruits were stored at 6.5±1 °C and 90–95% relative humidity for 150 days. The results indicated that both black seed oil and propolis treatments significantly influenced the maintenance of fruit weight and quality. At 150 days after storage, the fruit weight loss of the samples treated with MAP + 0.5% black seed oil, MAP + 0.1% propolis and MAP alone were found to be 5.5%, 6.3%, and 9.1%, respectively, whereas the weight loss of the untreated control fruits was 19.8%. Application of either 0.5% black seed oil or 0.1% propolis, especially when combined with MAP, was also effective in controlling gray mold development and slowing the occurrence of chilling injury.</description><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by İbrahim Kahramanoğlu, Mehmet Aktaş, Şerife Gündüz&lt;/p&gt;

Application of either 0.5% black seed oil or 0.1% propolis, especially when combined with MAP, was also effective in controlling gray mold development and slowing the occurrence of chilling injury.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527800400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198411</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198411</canonicalUrl><author><name>İbrahim Kahramanoğlu</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b955:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><engagement>44</engagement><author><name>Jeff Tollefson</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>db70005c</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05123-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;International research collaborations could end in wake of US president Donald Trump&apos;s decision.</description><crawled>1525832120976</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05123-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;International research collaborations could end in wake of US president Donald Trump&apos;s decision.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525849200000</published><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05123-y/d41586-018-05123-y_15745592.jpg</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16342ae7a90:76444d:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Maria Nguyen, Dimitri Krainc</name></author><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5576.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5576</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>a9bfa1a2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5576.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>LRRK2 phosphorylation of auxilin mediates synaptic defects in dopaminergic neurons from patients with Parkinson’s disease [Neuroscience]</title><unread>True</unread><description>Recently identified Parkinson’s disease (PD) genes involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, such as DNAJC6 (auxilin), have further implicated synaptic dysfunction in PD pathogenesis.

Peptidergic sensory neurons play a critical role in nociceptive pathways. To precisely define the function and plasticity of sensory neurons in detail, new tools such as transgenic mouse models are needed. We employed electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry to characterize in detail dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons expressing an inducible CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt; (CGRP-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;); and compared them to DRG neurons expressing Nav1.8&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; (Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; (TRPV1-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and TRPV1-GFP (V1-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Tamoxifen effectively induced CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt; production in DRG. ≈87% of CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt;-expressing neurons were co-labeled CGRP antibody. Three small and two medium-large-sized (5HT3a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/NPY2R&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and NPY2R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) neuronal groups with unique electrophysiological profiles were CGRP-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were detected in all CGRP-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups, as well as in 5 additional neuronal groups: MrgprD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, MrgprD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CGRP&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, vGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ≈30% of trkC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Differences between TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; and Nav1.8&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; reporters were that unlike TRPV1-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; expression was detected in non-nociceptive vGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and trkC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; populations. Many TRPV1-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons did not respond to capsaicin. In contrast, V1-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were in 4 groups, each of which was capsaicin-sensitive. Finally, none of the analyzed reporter lines showed &lt;i&gt;cre&lt;/i&gt;-recombination in trkB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, calbindin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, 70% of trkC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or parvalbumin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, which together encompassed ≈20% of Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; DRG neurons. The data presented here increases our knowledge of peptidergic sensory neuron characteristics, while showing the efficiency and specificity manipulation of peptidergic neurons by the CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt; reporter. We also demonstrate that manipulation of all C- and A-nociceptors is better achieved with TRPV1-cre reporter. Finally, the described approach for detailed characterization of sensory neuronal groups can be applied to a variety of reporter mice.</description><fingerprint>fdb407f0</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198601</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Characteristics of sensory neuronal groups in CGRP-cre-ER reporter mice: Comparison to Nav1.8-cre, TRPV1-cre and TRPV1-GFP mouse lines</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mayur J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Up to 25% of acute stroke patients first note symptoms upon awakening. We hypothesized that patients awaking with stroke symptoms may be safely treated with intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) using non-contrast head CT (NCHCT), if they meet all other standard criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The SAfety of Intravenous thromboLytics in stroke ON awakening (SAIL ON) was a prospective, open-label, single treatment arm, pilot safety trial of standard dose IV tPA in patients who presented with stroke symptoms within 0–4.5 hours of awakening. From January 30, 2013, to September 1, 2015, twenty consecutive wakeup stroke patients selected by NCHCT were enrolled. The primary outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in the first 36 hours. Secondary outcomes included NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) at 24 hours; and modified Rankin Score (mRS), NIHSS, and Barthel index at 90 days.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The average age was 65 years (range 47–83); 40% were women; 50% were African American. The average NIHSS was 6 (range 4–11). The average time from wake-up to IV tPA was 205 minutes (range 114–270). The average time from last known well to IV tPA was 580 minutes (range 353–876). The median mRS at 90 days was 1 (range 0–5). No patients had sICH; two of 20 (10%) had asymptomatic ICH on routine post IV tPA brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Administration of IV tPA was feasible and may be safe in wakeup stroke patients presenting within 4.5 hours from awakening, screened with NCHCT.

Background &lt;p&gt;Telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL-TL) was proposed as a biomarker of cancer risk. Recent scientific evidence suggested PBL-TL plays a diverse role in different cancers. Inconsistent results were obtained on PBL-TL in relation to breast cancer risk and specifically to the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The aim of the present case-control study was to analyse the correlation between family history of breast cancer or presence of a BRCA mutation and PBL-TL in the hypothesis that TL is a modifier of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;PBL-TL was measured using the real-time quantitative PCR method in DNA for 142 cases and 239 controls. All the women enrolled were characterized for cancer family history. A subgroup of 48 women were classified for the presence of a BRCA mutation. PBL-TL were summarized as means and standard deviations, and compared by standard analysis of variance. A multivariable Generalised Linear Model was fitted to the data with PBL-TL as the dependent variable, case/control status and presence of a BRCA/VUS mutation as factors, and age in 4 strata as a covariate.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Age was significantly associated with decreasing PBL-TL in controls (p = 0.01), but not in BC cases. The telomere length is shorter in cases than in controls after adjusting for age. No effect on PBL-TL of BMI, smoke nor of the most common risk factors for breast cancer was observed. No association between PBL-TL and family history was detected both in BC cases and controls. In the multivariate model, no association was observed between BRCA mutation and decreased PBL-TL. A statistically significant interaction (p = 0.031) between case-control status and a BRCA-mutation/VUS was observed, but no effect was detected for the interaction of cancer status and BRCA or VUS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study fails to provide support to the hypothesis that PBL-TL is associated with the risk of hereditary BC, or that is a marker of inherited mutations in BRCA genes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Pavanello, Liliana Varesco, Viviana Gismondi, Paolo Bruzzi, Claudia Bolognesi&lt;/p&gt;

Enniatins are common contaminants of food and feed and belong to the group of the “emerging” mycotoxins, which are produced by various &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species. Although a wide range of toxic effects, like antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and cytotoxic properties, have been described &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, so far, no cases of mycotoxicosis connected to enniatins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are reported. Among this group of mycotoxins, enniatin B and enniatin B1 are the most prevalent compounds and therefore are present in the human diet. Enniatins can reach systemic circulation, thus, the investigation of possible neurotoxic effects is of importance. Different cerebral cells were used to address effects on cell death having an impact on the blood-brain barrier. The influence of enniatin B and enniatin B1 on cellular viability was examined via Cell Counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) in three different cell types of the blood-brain barrier: porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1). CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to enniatin B (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.9 μM) and enniatin B1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.4 μM) than both endothelial cell types. In CCF-STTG1 cells, caspase-3 activation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were evaluated. Both compounds did not induce any LDH release and only enniatin B increased caspase-3 activity as a marker for apoptosis. The transport kinetics of enniatin B and enniatin B1 across the blood-brain barrier &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated using PBCEC, cultivated on Transwell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; filter inserts. Analysis of the apical and the basolateral compartment by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed high influx rates for enniatin B and enniatin B1.

Paddy rice fields are one of the most important sources of anthropogenic methane. Improving the accuracy in the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; budget is fundamental to identify strategies to mitigate climate change. Such improvement requires a mechanistic understanding of the complex interactions between environmental and agronomic factors determining CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, and also the characterization of the annual temporal CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions pattern in the whole crop cycle. Hence, both the growing and fallow seasons must be included. However, most of the previous research has been based on single-factor analyses that are focused on the growing season. In order to fill this gap, a study was conducted in a Mediterranean rice agrosystem (Ebre Delta, Catalonia) following a farm-to-farm approach with the purpose of 1) evaluating the cumulative and temporal pattern of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission, and 2) conducting a multi-variate analyses to assess the associative pattern, relative contribution and temporal variation of the main explanatory variables concerning the observed CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Measurements of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and agronomic and environmental parameters in 15 commercial rice fields were monitored monthly, during a whole crop field cycle. The temporal pattern of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission followed a bi-modal distribution peaking in August and October. The cumulative annual CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from rice fields amounted 314 kg CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, of which &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 70% were emitted during the fallow season. The main controlling factors of the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission rate in the growing season were positive related to water level and plant cover, while soil redox was negatively related. The main controlling factors in the fallow season were water level (negatively related, conversely to the growing season), as well as straw incorporation and soil temperature (positively related). The results of this study highlight the importance of the often neglected fallow season in the accurate estimation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and, thus, the necessity of measurement programs that cover the whole crop field cycle.

To identify phosphorylation-dependent interactions within the Plk1 network in human mitotic cells, we performed quantitative proteomics on HeLa cells cultured with kinase inhibitors or expressing a Plk1 mutant that was deficient in phosphorylation-dependent substrate binding. We found that many interactions were abolished upon kinase inhibition; however, a subset was protected from phosphatase opposition or was unopposed, resulting in persistent interaction of the substrate with Plk1.

Adult stem cells are considered multipotent, restricted to differentiate into a few tissue-specific cell types. With the advent of technologies which can dedifferentiate and transdifferentiate cell types, assumptions about the process of cell fate determination must be reconsidered, including the role of extrinsic versus intrinsic factors. To determine the plasticity of adult neural progenitors, rat hippocampal progenitor cells were xenotransplanted into embryonic zebrafish. These animals allow for easy detection of transplanted cells due to their external development and transparency at early stages. Adult neural progenitors were observed throughout the zebrafish for the duration of the experiment (at least five days post-transplantation). While the majority of transplanted cells were observed in the central nervous system, a large percentage of cells were located in superficial tissues. However, approximately one-third of these cells retained neural morphology and expression of the neuronal marker, Class III β-tubulin, indicating that the transplanted adult neural progenitors did not adapt alternate fates. A very small subset of cells demonstrated unique, non-neural flattened morphology, suggesting that adult neural progenitors may exhibit plasticity in this model, though at a very low rate. These findings demonstrate that the developing zebrafish may be an efficient model to explore plasticity of a variety of adult stem cell types and the role of external factors on cell fate.</description><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Use of the pediatric emergency department (PED) for low-acuity health issues is a growing problem, contributing to overcrowding, longer waits and higher health system costs. This study examines an educational initiative aimed at reducing low-acuity PED visits. The initiative, implemented at an academic pediatric hospital, saw PED physicians share a pamphlet with caregivers to educate them about appropriate PED use and alternatives. Despite early impacts, the initiative was not sustained. This study analyzes the barriers and enablers to physician participation in the initiative, and offers strategies to improve implementation and sustainability of similar future initiatives.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-two PED physicians were invited to participate in a semi-structured individual interview assessing their views about low-acuity visits, their pamphlet use, barriers and enablers to pamphlet use, and the initiative’s potential for reducing low-acuity visits. Suggestions were solicited for improving the initiative and reducing low-acuity visits. Constant comparative method was used during analysis. Codes were developed inductively and iteratively, then grouped according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Efforts to ensure study credibility included seeking participant feedback on the findings.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-three PED physicians were interviewed (55%). Barriers and enablers for pamphlet use were identified and grouped according to five of the 14 TDF domains: social/professional role and identity; beliefs about consequences; environmental context and resources; social influences; and emotions.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The TDF provided an effective approach to identify the key elements influencing physician participation in the educational initiative. This information will help inform behavior change interventions to improve the implementation of similar future initiatives that involve physicians as the primary educators of caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gregory Huyer, Samia Chreim, Wojtek Michalowski, Ken J.

When a phylogenetic tree can be built as a prior hypothesis to such classification, &amp;quot;Phylogenetic placement&amp;quot; (PP) provides the most informative type of classification because each query sequence is assigned to its putative origin in the tree.

Results: We have developed RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic Placement via Ancestral Sequences) which uses an alignment-free approach removing the hurdle of query sequence alignment as a preliminary step to PP. Our approach relies on the precomputation of a database of k-mers present with non-negligible probability in the relatives of the reference sequences. The placement is performed by inspecting the stored phylogenetic origins of the k-mers in the query, and their probabilities. The database can be reused for the analysis of several different metagenomes. Experiments show that the first implementation of RAPPAS is already faster than the previous likelihood-based PP algorithms, while keeping similar accuracy for short reads.

The objective of this paper is to fill a gap in the literature on internationalization, in relation to the absence of objective and measurable performance indicators for the process of how firms sequentially enter external markets. To that end, this research develops a quantitative tool for use as a performance indicator of gradualness for firms entering external markets at a sectoral level. The performance indicator is based on firms’ export volumes, number of years operating in the export market, geographic areas targeted for export and when exports began to each area. The indicator is tested empirically in the wine sector. The main contribution of this study is the creation of a reliable international priority index, which can serve more widely as a valuable tool because of its potential use in other industry sectors and geographic areas, and which would allow the analysis of how geographically differentiated internationalization strategies develop.</description><crawled>1525455544496</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mónica Clavel San Emeterio, Rubén Fernández-Ortiz, Jesús Arteaga-Ortiz, Pablo Dorta-González&lt;/p&gt;

Now here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1706441&quot;&gt;the full writeup&lt;/a&gt; in NEJM, and futility appears to have been &lt;em&gt;le mot juste&lt;/em&gt;. There were two treatment groups (12 mg and 40 mg), and in neither one did the ADAS-cog or ADAS-ADL scores (scales for degree of dementia and ability to function) improve whatsoever. There was no difference in the people who had been scored at the start with milder Alzheimer’s, and no difference related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E#Alzheimer%27s_disease&quot;&gt;APOE4 status&lt;/a&gt;. The placebo group in general declined at a normal Alzheimer’s rate, so that’s not the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many other markers examined, and in every case treatment did nothing at all or did things that are hard to interpret, such as decreasing hippocampal volume (which has been noted in other anti-amyloid studies, and whose significance is actually not well understood). And all this was while cerebrospinal fluid measurements showed that all the amyloid species assayed decreased sharply in the treatment groups. This compound lowered 1-40 amyloid-beta, it lowered 1-42, it lowered APP-beta, all by like 70% and more, decreased brain amyloid itself (by PET imaging) and &lt;em&gt;nothing happened&lt;/em&gt;. An intelligent space alien with no history in human Alzheimer’s research would examine these results and conclude that the hypothesis that reducing cerebral amyloid is beneficial is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. The paper comes out and states as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past the efficacy data, or lack of same, the adverse events with drug treatment were notably higher, and in a dose-responsive manner. These included falls, weight loss, sleep disturbance, change in hair color, and suicidal ideation (that last one technically mild, but definitely real). So not only was there no benefit, there was some actual harm, which makes halting the trial absolutely the correct decision to make. But there &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13543784.2017.1369527?journalCode=ieid20&quot;&gt;are still&lt;/a&gt; BACE clinical trials &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/merck-study-may-signal-doom-for-a-broad-group-of-pivotal-alzheimers-studies/&quot;&gt;going on&lt;/a&gt;, and if you weren’t pessimistic about them before this trial, you should be now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525445471000</published><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13513</link><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/04/mercks-bace-inhibitor-alzheimers-wipeout</canonicalUrl><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_1632ba63e76:15af78f:93d646dc</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Junheng Gao</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25899-3</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>6ba7ff89</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/RD_9D86bxGY/s41598-018-25899-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25899-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25899-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25899-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/RD_9D86bxGY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1526289450172</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25899-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25899-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/RD_9D86bxGY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526281200000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25899-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><height>558</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25899-3/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25899_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1635df0c4bc:2e36445:93d646dc</id></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><keywords><item>Letters</item></keywords><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4316.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4316</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>8f9aa5f2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4316.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Strengthening the immune system for cancer prevention [Biological Sciences]</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><description>Palmer et al.

Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in Ontario, Canada. We describe the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of LD in Ontario and examine trends in the incidence of non-disseminated and disseminated LD. LD surveillance data from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) from 2005–2014 were mapped to symptoms according to syndrome groups (erythema migrans (EM), flu-like, cardiac, neurologic or arthritic) and disease stages (early localized, early disseminated or late disseminated). During the study period, 1,230 cases due to &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdoferi&lt;/i&gt; were reported in Ontario with annual incidence rates ranging from 0.32 (2006) to 2.16 (2013) cases per 100,000 population. Seventy percent of cases had EM and the proportion of cases with EM increased over time. Other clinical manifestations included flu-like (75%), arthritic (42%), neurologic (41%) and cardiac (6%) symptoms. Early localized disease (n = 415) manifested with EM (87%) and flu-like (57%) symptoms; early disseminated disease (n = 216) manifested with neurologic (94%), cardiac (10%) and EM (63%) symptoms; and late disseminated disease (n = 475) manifested with EM (62%), neurologic (55%), cardiac (9%), and arthritic symptoms (i.e., arthralgia (93%) and arthritis (7%)). Early localized and early disseminated cases (88% each) occurred primarily from May through September, compared to late disseminated cases (81%). The proportion of cases reported to public health within 30 days of illness onset increased during the study period, while the proportion of cases reported within 1–3 months and &gt;3 months decreased. Geographical variations characterized by higher incidence of early localized disease and earlier public health notification (within 30 days of illness onset) occurred in regions with established or recently established LD risk areas, while later public health notification (&gt;3 months after illness onset) was reported more frequently in regions with recently established or no identified risk areas. This is the first study to describe the clinical manifestations of LD in Ontario, Canada. The observed geographical variations in the epidemiology of LD in Ontario reinforce the need for regionally focused public health strategies aimed at increasing awareness, promoting earlier recognition and reporting, and encouraging greater uptake of preventive measures.</description><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Karen O.

The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen. Importantly, the training-induced change in rs-FC was observed only with the MT+, but not with the dACC or insula. Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL.</description><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi, Ryuta Aoki, Kaho Tsumura, Ruedeerat Keerativittayayut, Koji Jimura, Kiyoshi Nakahara&lt;/p&gt;

These simulations agree with previous experimental studies, and we report the atomistic details of these events to further therapeutic studies on A3B.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><crawled>1525437875142</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1525392000000</published><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1632b2ec3c6:143ff89:3dd877af</id><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><unread>False</unread></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Ruwan Gunaratne</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4153</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>4a78e9a1</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4153</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Combination of aptamer and drug for reversible anticoagulation in cardiopulmonary bypass</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4153</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Combination of aptamer and drug for reversible anticoagulation in cardiopulmonary bypass&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combination of aptamer and drug for reversible anticoagulation in cardiopulmonary bypass, Published online: 04 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4153&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4153&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An aptamer is combined with a drug to prevent clot formation in a model of cardiopulmonary bypass.</description><crawled>1528125122831</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Combination of aptamer and drug for reversible anticoagulation in cardiopulmonary bypass&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combination of aptamer and drug for reversible anticoagulation in cardiopulmonary bypass, Published online: 04 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4153&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4153&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An aptamer is combined with a drug to prevent clot formation in a model of cardiopulmonary bypass.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528095600000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_163cb5ae90f:4c8923f:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><keywords><item>Materials Science</item></keywords><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/748-m?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/748.13.full</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>ba205c72</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/748-m?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Plastic in the dark</title><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1526578752000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/748-m?rss=1</link><author><name>Szuromi, P.</name></author><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395ba:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><author><name>Russell K.

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9) has become the tool of choice for genome editing. Despite the fact that it has evolved as a highly efficient means to edit/replace coding sequence, CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency for “clean” editing of non-coding DNA remains low. We set out to introduce a single base-pair substitution in two intronic SNPs at the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; locus without altering nearby non-coding sequence. Substitution efficiency increased up to 10-fold by treatment of human embryonic stem cells (ESC) with non-toxic levels of DMSO (1%) before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery. Treatment with DMSO did not result in CRISPR/Cas9 off-target effects or compromise the chromosomal stability of the ESC. Twenty-four hour treatment of human ESC with DMSO before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery may prove a simple means to increase editing efficiency of non-coding DNA without incorporation of undesirable mutations.</description><fingerprint>584e3b44</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198637</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>DMSO increases efficiency of genome editing at two non-coding loci</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by George Stratigopoulos, Maria Caterina De Rosa, Charles A.

Many methods have been developed to select a subset of variant loci, which are associated with or predictive of the phenotype. Selecting connected SNPs on SNP-SNP networks have been proven successful in finding biologically interpretable and predictive SNPs. However, we argue that the connectedness constraint favors selecting redundant features that affect similar biological processes and therefore does not necessarily yield better predictive performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called SPADIS that favors the selection of remotely located SNPs in order to account for their complementary effects in explaining a phenotype.

We compare SPADIS to the state-of-the-art method SConES, on a dataset of Arabidopsis Thaliana with continuous flowering time phenotypes. SPADIS has better average phenotype prediction performance in 15 out of 17 phenotypes when the same number of SNPs are selected and provides consistent improvements across multiple networks and settings on average.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sNFhadDEsvQ/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Network inference reveals novel connections in pathways regulating growth and defense in the yeast salt response</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><crawled>1525801275042</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew E.

This work presents a novel computational method to elucidate metabolic changes that empower community formation and thus guide the optimization of co-cultures for a desired application.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526886000000</published><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/21/327270</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16382ef615b:65d449a:93d646dc</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197397</originId><updated>1525899600000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197397</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>ab3c92c4</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197397</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Correction: Determining carnivore habitat use in a rubber/forest landscape in Brazil using multispecies occupancy models</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Dechner, Kevin M.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and irreversible scarring disease in the lung with poor prognosis. Few therapies are available; therefore it is critical to identify new therapeutic targets. Our lab has previously identified the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) as a potential therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis. We found increases in LDHA protein and its metabolic product, lactate, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Importantly, we described lactate as a novel pro-fibrotic mediator by acidifying the extracellular space, and activating latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) in a pH-dependent manner. We propose a pro-fibrotic feed-forward loop by which LDHA produces lactate, lactate decreases pH in the extracellular space and activates TGF-β1 which can further perpetuate fibrotic signaling. Our previous work also demonstrates that the LDHA inhibitor gossypol inhibits TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we employed a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis to test whether gossypol inhibits pulmonary fibrosis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that gossypol dose-dependently inhibits bleomycin-induced collagen accumulation and TGF-β1 activation in mouse lungs when treatment is started on the same day as bleomycin administration. Importantly, gossypol was also effective at treating collagen accumulation when delayed 7 days following bleomycin. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of LDHA with the inhibitor gossypol is effective at both preventing and treating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and suggests that LDHA may be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.</description><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer L.

The mammalian secretoglobin (SCGB) superfamily contains functionally diverse members, among which the major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse salivary androgen-binding protein (ABP) display similar subunits. We searched for molecular similarities between Fel d 1 and ABP to examine the possibility that they play similar roles. We aimed to i) cluster the evolutionary relationships of the SCGB superfamily; ii) identify divergence patterns, structural overlap, and protein-protein docking between Fel d 1 and ABP dimers; and iii) explore the residual interaction between ABP dimers and steroid binding in chemical communication using computational approaches. We also report that the evolutionary tree of the SCGB superfamily comprises seven unique palm-like clusters, showing the evolutionary pattern and divergence time tree of Fel d 1 with 28 ABP paralogs. Three ABP subunits (A27, BG27, and BG26) share phylogenetic relationships with Fel d 1 chains. The Fel d 1 and ABP subunits show similarities in terms of sequence conservation, identical motifs and binding site clefts. Topologically equivalent positions were visualized through superimposition of ABP A27:BG27 (AB) and ABP A27:BG26 (AG) dimers on a heterodimeric Fel d 1 model. In docking, Fel d 1-ABP dimers exhibit the maximum surface binding ability of AG compared with that of AB dimers and the several polar interactions between ABP dimers with steroids. Hence, cat Fel d 1 is an ABP-like molecule in which monomeric chains 1 and 2 are the equivalent of the ABPA and ABPBG monomers, respectively. These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding.</description><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rajesh Durairaj, Patrick Pageat, Cécile Bienboire-Frosini&lt;/p&gt;

End-stage renal disease is strongly associated with progressive cardiovascular calcification (CVC) and there is currently no therapy targeted to treat CVC. SNF472 is an experimental formulation under development for treatment of soft tissue calcification. We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of SNF472 administration in rats and its inhibitory effects on CVC. SNF472 was studied in three rat models: (1) prevention of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with an intravenous SNF472 bolus of 1 mg/kg SNF472, (2) inhibition of progression of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with a subcutaneous SNF472 bolus of 10 or 60 mg/kg SNF472, starting after calcification induction, (3) CVC in adenine-induced uremic rats treated with 50 mg/kg SNF472 via i.v. 4h -infusion. Uremic rats presented lower plasma levels of SNF472 than control animals after i.v. infusion. CVC in non-uremic rats was inhibited by 60–70% after treatment with SNF472 and progression of cardiac calcification completely blocked. Development of CVC in uremic rats was inhibited by up to 80% following i.v. infusion of SNF472. SNF472 inhibits the development and progression of CVC in uremic and non-uremic rats in the same range of SNF472 plasma levels but using in each case the required dose to obtain those levels. These results collectively support the development of SNF472 as a novel therapeutic option for treatment of CVC in humans.</description><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miguel D.

Bandaging of limb wounds in horses leads to formation of exuberant granulation tissue (EGT) that retards healing due to protracted inflammation, aberrant vascularisation and delayed epithelialisation. EGT is not observed if wounds are left undressed or when wounds are on the body. A previous study showed that short-term administration of proteins derived from orf virus dampened inflammation and promoted epithelialisation of open wounds in horses. Here, we investigated the impact of orf virus interleukin-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor-E on the development and resolution of EGT. Excisional wounds were created on the forelimb of four horses, and bandages were maintained until full healing to induce EGT formation. Matching body wounds were created to ensure EGT was limited to the limb, and to differentiate the effects of the viral proteins on normal healing and on EGT formation. Viral proteins or the hydrogel vehicle control were administered topically to site-matched wounds at day 1, with repeat administration at day 8. Wound healing and EGT formation were monitored macroscopically. Wound margin samples were harvested at 2, 7 and 14 days, and at full healing, with histology used to observe epithelialisation, immunofluorescence used to detect inflammatory cells, angiogenesis and cell death, and qPCR to measure expression of genes regulating inflammation and angiogenesis. Limb wounds developed EGT, and exhibited slower healing than body wounds. Viral protein treatment did not accelerate healing at either location nor limit EGT formation in limb wounds. Treatment of limb wounds did however increase epithelialisation and angiogenesis, without dampening inflammatory cell infiltration or gene expression. The healed wounds also had less occlusion and death of blood vessels and fewer epidermal rete ridges following viral protein treatment. These findings indicate that the viral protein treatment does not suppress wound inflammation or EGT formation, but does promote vascular and epidermal repair and EGT resolution.</description><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lyn M.

Overconfidence has been reported to be a common bias among entrepreneurs and might be one cause of the high failure rates observed for new ventures. In this study, we investigate the overconfidence bias in a sample of 92 Austrian entrepreneurs, who responded to a general-knowledge questionnaire. Their levels of overconfidence were assessed by their responses to hard, medium and easy knowledge questions, and the relations of individual, organizational and environmental factors to the bias score were analyzed. The results confirmed that entrepreneurs are indeed prone to expressing overprecision, a type of overconfidence, but not when answering questions of all levels of difficulty. Being a single founder instead of a co-founder was identified as a significant predictor of overconfidence. Confidence, on the other hand, was associated with age and prior entrepreneurial experience, while accuracy was determined solely by age. The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</description><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Viktorija Ilieva, Thomas Brudermann, Ljubomir Drakulevski&lt;/p&gt;

TF knockdown experiments have revealed correlations between TF binding profiles and gene expression levels. We present a general framework capable of predicting genes with similar tissue-wide expression patterns from activated or repressed TF targets using machine learning to combine TF binding and epigenetic features. Methods: Genes with correlated expression patterns across 53 tissues were identified according to their Bray-Curtis similarity. DNase I-accessible promoter intervals of direct TF target genes were scanned with previously derived information theory-based position weight matrices (iPWMs) of 82 TFs. Features from information density-based TFBS clusters were used to predict target genes with machine learning classifiers. The accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the classifiers were determined for different feature sets. Mutations in TFBSs were also introduced to in silico examine their impact on cluster densities and the regulatory states of target genes. Results: We initially chose the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1), whose regulation has been extensively studied, to test this approach. SLC25A32 and TANK were found to exhibit the most similar expression patterns to this gene across 53 tissues. A Decision Tree classifier exhibited the largest area (0.9987 and 0.9956 respectively before and after eliminating inaccessible promoter intervals based on DNase I HyperSensitive Regions (DHSs)) under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve in detecting such coordinately regulated genes. Target gene prediction was confirmed using siRNA knockdown data of TFs, which was more accurate than CRISPR inactivation. In-silico mutation analyses of TFBSs also revealed that one or more information-dense TFBS clusters in promoters are required for accurate target gene prediction. Conclusions: Machine learning based on TFBS information density, organization, and chromatin accessibility accurately identifies gene targets with comparable tissue-wide expression patterns. Multiple, information-dense TFBS clusters in promoters appear to protect promoters from the effects of deleterious binding site mutations in a single TFBS that would effectively alter the expression state of these genes.</description><crawled>1527200381289</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>Background: The distribution and composition of cis-regulatory modules (e.g. transcription factor binding site (TFBS) clusters) in promoters substantially determine gene expression patterns and TF targets, whose expression levels are significantly regulated by TF binding.

Multiple, information-dense TFBS clusters in promoters appear to protect promoters from the effects of deleterious binding site mutations in a single TFBS that would effectively alter the expression state of these genes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527145200000</published><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/24/283267</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163943c7969:8304b90:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Kira Moon</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26363-y</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>9fb40e8b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/Ba8kn4OLU-s/s41598-018-26363-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Genomic and ecological study of two distinctive freshwater bacteriophages infecting a Comamonadaceae bacterium</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26363-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genomic and ecological study of two distinctive freshwater bacteriophages infecting a &lt;i&gt;Comamonadaceae&lt;/i&gt; bacterium&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genomic and ecological study of two distinctive freshwater bacteriophages infecting a &amp;lt;i&gt;Comamonadaceae&amp;lt;/i&gt; bacterium, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26363-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26363-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Genomic and ecological study of two distinctive freshwater bacteriophages infecting a &lt;i&gt;Comamonadaceae&lt;/i&gt; bacterium&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Ba8kn4OLU-s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1526980668897</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genomic and ecological study of two distinctive freshwater bacteriophages infecting a &lt;i&gt;Comamonadaceae&lt;/i&gt; bacterium&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genomic and ecological study of two distinctive freshwater bacteriophages infecting a &amp;lt;i&gt;Comamonadaceae&amp;lt;/i&gt; bacterium, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26363-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26363-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Genomic and ecological study of two distinctive freshwater bacteriophages infecting a &lt;i&gt;Comamonadaceae&lt;/i&gt; bacterium&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Ba8kn4OLU-s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526972400000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26363-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><height>337</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26363-y/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26363_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1638723ede1:6bed1e6:93d646dc</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Jennifer A.

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time. The model was used to forecast cholera incidence for the months after the passage of the hurricane (October-December 2016) and to predict the impact of a planned oral cholera vaccination campaign. Our first projection, from October 29 to December 31, predicted the highest incidence in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud, accounting for about 45% of the total cases in Haiti. The projection included a second peak in cholera incidence in early December largely driven by heavy rainfall forecasts, confirming the urgency for rapid intervention. A second projection (from November 12 to December 31) used updated rainfall forecasts to estimate that 835 cases would be averted by vaccinations in Grande Anse (90% Prediction Interval [PI] 476-1284) and 995 in Sud (90% PI 508-2043). The experience gained by this modeling effort shows that state-of-the-art computational modeling and data-assimilation methods can produce informative near real-time projections of cholera incidence. Collaboration among modelers and field epidemiologists is indispensable to gain fast access to field data and to translate model results into operational recommendations for emergency management during an outbreak. Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006127</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rXysUXWSU_g/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Near real-time forecasting for cholera decision making in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><crawled>1526493492706</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Damiano Pasetto, Flavio Finger, Anton Camacho, Francesco Grandesso, Sandra Cohuet, Joseph C.

The server is 100% accurate in detecting NAT/NCS2 family members.

Shanechi&lt;/p&gt;
Closed-loop neurotechnologies often need to adaptively learn an encoding model that relates the neural activity to the brain state, and is used for brain state decoding. The speed and accuracy of adaptive learning algorithms are critically affected by the learning rate, which dictates how fast model parameters are updated based on new observations. Despite the importance of the learning rate, currently an analytical approach for its selection is largely lacking and existing signal processing methods vastly tune it empirically or heuristically. Here, we develop a novel analytical calibration algorithm for optimal selection of the learning rate in adaptive Bayesian filters. We formulate the problem through a fundamental trade-off that learning rate introduces between the steady-state error and the convergence time of the estimated model parameters. We derive explicit functions that predict the effect of learning rate on error and convergence time. Using these functions, our calibration algorithm can keep the steady-state parameter error covariance smaller than a desired upper-bound while minimizing the convergence time, or keep the convergence time faster than a desired value while minimizing the error. We derive the algorithm both for discrete-valued spikes modeled as point processes nonlinearly dependent on the brain state, and for continuous-valued neural recordings modeled as Gaussian processes linearly dependent on the brain state. Using extensive closed-loop simulations, we show that the analytical solution of the calibration algorithm accurately predicts the effect of learning rate on parameter error and convergence time.

Shanechi&lt;/p&gt;
Closed-loop neurotechnologies often need to adaptively learn an encoding model that relates the neural activity to the brain state, and is used for brain state decoding. The speed and accuracy of adaptive learning algorithms are critically affected by the learning rate, which dictates how fast model parameters are updated based on new observations. Despite the importance of the learning rate, currently an analytical approach for its selection is largely lacking and existing signal processing methods vastly tune it empirically or heuristically. Here, we develop a novel analytical calibration algorithm for optimal selection of the learning rate in adaptive Bayesian filters. We formulate the problem through a fundamental trade-off that learning rate introduces between the steady-state error and the convergence time of the estimated model parameters. We derive explicit functions that predict the effect of learning rate on error and convergence time. Using these functions, our calibration algorithm can keep the steady-state parameter error covariance smaller than a desired upper-bound while minimizing the convergence time, or keep the convergence time faster than a desired value while minimizing the error. We derive the algorithm both for discrete-valued spikes modeled as point processes nonlinearly dependent on the brain state, and for continuous-valued neural recordings modeled as Gaussian processes linearly dependent on the brain state. Using extensive closed-loop simulations, we show that the analytical solution of the calibration algorithm accurately predicts the effect of learning rate on parameter error and convergence time. Moreover, the calibration algorithm allows for fast and accurate learning of the encoding model and for fast convergence of decoding to accurate performance. Finally, larger learning rates result in inaccurate encoding models and decoders, and smaller learning rates delay their convergence. The calibration algorithm provides a novel analytical approach to predictably achieve a desired level of error and convergence time in adaptive learning, with application to closed-loop neurotechnologies and other signal processing domains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AXBHSencE5U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527627600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006168</link><author><name>Han-Lin Hsieh</name></author><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>ee3c6f1f</fingerprint><recrawled>1527626526848</recrawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163ad15e82f:1385da7:c2c34441</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02338/20180518/images/medium/jp-2018-02338c_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02338&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Asthma is the most common chronic disease during pregnancy and it may have influence on pregnancy outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our goal was to assess the association between maternal asthma and the perinatal risks as well as possible effects of asthma medication.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was based on a nationwide Finnish register-based cohort between the years 1996 and 2012 in the Drug and Pregnancy Database. The register data comprised 962 405 singleton live and stillbirths, 898 333 (93.3%) pregnancies in mothers with neither confirmed asthma nor use of asthma medication (controls), and 26 674 (2.8%) pregnancies with confirmed maternal asthma. 71% of mothers with asthma used asthma medication. The diagnosis of asthma was based on the mothers’ right for subsidised medication which is carefully evaluated by strict criteria including pulmonary function testing. Odds ratio was used in comparison. Premature birth (PB), low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), neonatal death were the main outcome measures.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Maternal asthma was associated with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for perinatal mortality 1.24 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.46), preterm birth 1.18 (1.11 to 1.25), low birth weight 1.29 (1.21 to 1.37), fetal growth restriction (SGA) 1.32, (1.24 to 1.40), and asphyxia 1.09 (1.02 to 1.17). Asthma treatment reduced the increased risk of preterm birth aOR 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) but mothers with treated asthma had higher risks of fetal growth restriction (SGA) aOR 1.26 (1.10 to 1.45), and asphyxia aOR 1.37 (1.17 to 1.61) than mothers with untreated asthma.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Asthma is associated with increased risks of perinatal mortality, preterm birth, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction (SGA), and asphyxia.

A collaboration between the University of Helsinki, LifeArc (which looks to be one of the small companies in the former Stevenage pharma campus) and Cyclofluidic reports development of inhibitors against hepsin, a serine protease enzyme that is a potential cancer target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so uncontroversial. The same group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/onc2015248&quot;&gt;had identified&lt;/a&gt; a micromolar hepsin inhibitor from some late-1990s urokinase inhibitor chemical matter, but this compound (naturally) still had activity against urokinase. The goal was to improve potency while working away from urokinase, which is just the sort of thing that med-chem teams everywhere spend their efforts on. The enzyme seems to need an amidine/guanadine functional group for potency, and a screen of commercially available derivatives gave another micromolar hit with less urokinase activity as a new starting point. 142 new compounds were prepared, optimizing along until a final compound was reached with 22 nM potency and 200x more selectivity in the counterscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is good: that’s what a team of medicinal chemists are there to do. What makes this paper interesting (and those who have heard of Cyclofluidic will have already caught on) is that the chemistry was automated in a flow reactor, and the enzyme assay results were fed back into the software which generated SAR predictions for the next round of synthesis. Importantly, the screening assay is part of the automated system as well, and the entire loop (synthesis/purification/assay) is claimed to take around 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this actually worked was that the automated system would run through a particular SAR space, generating a series of compounds, and at that point the humans involved would have a look at how things were going. Subsequent runs might include new SAR building blocks or changes to the algorithms that evaluated the results. So it’s not like they walked away for a weekend and came back 142 compounds later to a selective nanomolar inhibitor – but neither is it the case that people made all these compounds and selected the next ones to make, either. This was machine-assisted compound development, very much analogous to what Gary Kasparov has termed “centaur” chess, where humans evaluate their ideas with the aid of software to come up with even stronger moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needs to be noted that the chemistry involved was very straightforward (amide and sulfonamide formation, for the most part) and the assays were quite robust. This was close (as have been the other things reported in this vein) to a best-case example for such closed-loop automated SAR work, but then again these are early days. I also noticed that several of the co-authors on the paper now have different addresses, which makes one wonder how long ago this project was actually done. My point is that automated synthesis (thanks to human ingenuity) is getting better all the time, as are the methods for in-line assays and especially those for evaluation of chemical space and SAR. Thanks to human ingenuity, we are very likely going to be freeing up time to apply that ingenuity to other things than banging out obvious SAR compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, though, you are a human chemist (as so many of my readers are, to steal a joke from G. K. Chesterton), and you feel that you are watching your livelihood being stolen right in front of your eyes, consider what in this case the machines are taking from you. You are being deprived of the chance to do some of the most boring chemistry in the world in the most routine fashion imaginable. My own feelings are that any machine that takes away from me the necessity to crank out 142 amide reactions by hand is welcome to it. This is the med-chem equivalent of doing the laundry, and I have a machine for that, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527166700000</published><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13562</link><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/24/a-closed-loop</canonicalUrl><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_163923f89ef:7e26a46:93d646dc</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Lenz, S.</name></author><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335851v1?rss=1</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>4c033120</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335851v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>In-Search Selection of Monoisotopic Peaks Improves the Identification of Cross-Linked Peptides [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335851v1?rss=1</link><description>Cross-linking/mass spectrometry (CLMS) has gone through a maturation process similar to standard proteomics by adapting key methods such as false discovery rate control and quantification.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) transplant has been reported to be a potential treatment for burn wounds. However, the effects of autogenicity and allogenicity of ADSCs on burn wound healing have not been investigated and the method for using ADSCs still needs to be established. This study compared the healing effects of autologous and allogenic ADSCs and determined an optimal method of using ADSCs to treat acute burn wounds. Experiments were performed in 20 male Wistar rats (weight, 176–250 g; age, 6–7 weeks). Two identical full-thickness burn wounds (radius, 4 mm) were created in each rat. ADSCs harvested from inguinal area and characterized by their high multipotency were injected into burn wounds in the original donor rats (autologous ADSCs group) or in other rats (allogenic ADSCs group). The injection site was either the wound center or the four corners 0.5 cm from the wound edge. The reduction of burn surface areas in the two experimental groups and in control group were evaluated with Image J software for 15 days post-wounding to determine the wound healing rates. Wound healing was significantly faster in the autologous ADSCs group compared to both the allogenic ADSCs group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;) and control group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;). Wound healing in the allogenic ADSC group did not significantly differ from that in control group. Notably, ADSC injections 0.5cm from the wound edge showed significantly improved healing compared to ADSCs injections in the wound center (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;). This study demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of ADSCs in treating acute burn wounds in rats. However, only autologous ADSCs improved healing in acute burn wounds; allogenic ADSCs did not.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) transplant has been reported to be a potential treatment for burn wounds. However, the effects of autogenicity and allogenicity of ADSCs on burn wound healing have not been investigated and the method for using ADSCs still needs to be established. This study compared the healing effects of autologous and allogenic ADSCs and determined an optimal method of using ADSCs to treat acute burn wounds. Experiments were performed in 20 male Wistar rats (weight, 176–250 g; age, 6–7 weeks). Two identical full-thickness burn wounds (radius, 4 mm) were created in each rat. ADSCs harvested from inguinal area and characterized by their high multipotency were injected into burn wounds in the original donor rats (autologous ADSCs group) or in other rats (allogenic ADSCs group). The injection site was either the wound center or the four corners 0.5 cm from the wound edge. The reduction of burn surface areas in the two experimental groups and in control group were evaluated with Image J software for 15 days post-wounding to determine the wound healing rates. Wound healing was significantly faster in the autologous ADSCs group compared to both the allogenic ADSCs group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;) and control group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;). Wound healing in the allogenic ADSC group did not significantly differ from that in control group. Notably, ADSC injections 0.5cm from the wound edge showed significantly improved healing compared to ADSCs injections in the wound center (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;). This study demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of ADSCs in treating acute burn wounds in rats. However, only autologous ADSCs improved healing in acute burn wounds; allogenic ADSCs did not. This study further determined a superior location of using ADSCs injections to treat burn wounds including the injection site. Future studies will replicate the experiment in a larger and long-term scale burn wounds in higher mammalian models to facilitate ADSCs therapy in burn wound clinical practice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527022800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197744</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197744</canonicalUrl><author><name>Yu-Wei Chang</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094066:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Khalid Sossey-Alaoui</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25373-0</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>f233e238</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/z4PjGy_IqyQ/s41598-018-25373-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25373-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25373-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25373-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/z4PjGy_IqyQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1525857424276</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25373-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25373-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The Kindlin-2 regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer metastasis is mediated through miR-200b&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/z4PjGy_IqyQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525849200000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25373-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>496</width><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25373-0/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25373_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16344309394:9a540e:3dd877af</id></item><item><engagement>6</engagement><author><name>Nina A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Although many previous studies have examined the determinants of happiness in older adults, few have investigated the association between pension types and happiness. When compared to other conventional socioeconomic indicators, pension types may be more indicative of long-term socioeconomic status as they can reflect a person’s job history over their life course. This study examined the association between pension types and happiness in Japanese older people.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study were used to analyze the association between pension types and happiness. The study population comprised 120152 participants from 2013. We calculated the prevalence ratios of happiness for the different pension types using Poisson regression models that controlled for age, sex, marital status, equivalent income, wealth, education level, working status, occupation, depression, and social support.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After controlling for socioeconomic indicators, the prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of happiness for no pension benefits, low pension benefits, and moderate pension benefits relative to high pension benefits were 0.77 (0.73–0.81), 0.95 (0.94–0.97), and 0.98 (0.97–0.99), respectively. However, the inclusion of depression as a covariate weakened the association between pension types and happiness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While pension types were associated with happiness after adjusting for other proxy measures of socioeconomic status, the association diminished following adjustment for depression.

In addition to conventional socioeconomic indicators, pension types should also be considered when assessing the determinants of happiness in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526936400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197423</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197423</canonicalUrl><author><name>Ichiro Sasaki</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761225:93d646dc</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197550</originId><updated>1527714000000</updated><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>8c0278ed</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197550</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) assessment of short- and long-term treatment outcome in Budd-Chiari syndrome: A pilot study</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hong-Wei Wang, Hua-Ning Shi, Jia Cheng, Fang Xie, Yu-Kun Luo, Jie Tang&lt;/p&gt;
Purpose &lt;p&gt;The first aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between liver stiffness measurement, hepatic venous pressure and liver fibrosis. The second aim was to demonstrate the utility of real-time shear wave elastography for evaluation of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients before and after balloon hepatic venous angioplasty.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 32 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome slated for successful balloon angioplasty met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Shear wave elastography was used to generate dynamic liver stiffness measurement 2 days before angioplasty and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty. Hepatic venous pressures were measured during balloon angioplasty. Correlations among liver stiffness, hepatic venous pressure, and fibrosis were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Mean liver stiffness was 35.17 ± 10.60 kPa, 20.15 ± 5.47 kPa, 15.36 ± 4.34 kPa and 15.68 ± 5.58 kPa at baseline and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty, respectively. Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after angioplasty was significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.001); liver stiffness measured at 6 months after angioplasty was not significantly different from that measured at 3 months after angioplasty (P = 0.636). Analysis of liver stiffness measurement and hepatic venous pressure before balloon angioplasty yielded a coefficient of correlation r = 0.701 (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Before and 2d after angioplasty, liver stiffness measurement did not correlated with fibrosis (r = − 0.170, P = 0.22), (r = 0.223, P = 0.220), respectively, while the LSM difference before and 2 days after angioplasty negatively correlated with stiffness severity (r = − 0.502, P = 0.003). Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after angioplasty was significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.001), remaining stable at 3 months, though still in the cirrhotic range.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The liver stiffness of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients, measured by shear wave elastography, decreased considerably after hepatic venous recanalization, and significantly correlated with hepatic venous pressure though not with degree of fibrosis.

In recent years, effective treatment of infections caused by &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; has become challenging due to the ability of the bacterium to acquire or up-regulate antimicrobial resistance determinants. Two component signal transduction systems are known to regulate expression of virulence factors including multidrug efflux pumps. Here, we investigated the role of the AdeRS two component signal transduction system in regulating the AdeAB efflux system, determined whether AdeA and/or AdeB can individually confer antimicrobial resistance, and explored the interplay between pentamidine resistance and growth conditions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 17978. Results identified that deletion of &lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; affected resistance towards chlorhexidine and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, two previously defined AdeABC substrates, and also identified an 8-fold decrease in resistance to pentamidine. Examination of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt;, Δ&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and Δ&lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; cells augmented results seen for Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; and identified a set of dicationic AdeAB substrates. RNA-sequencing of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; revealed transcription of 290 genes were ≥2-fold altered compared to the wildtype. Pentamidine shock significantly increased &lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt; expression in the wildtype, but decreased it in Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt;, implying that AdeRS activates &lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; transcription in ATCC 17978. Investigation under multiple growth conditions, including the use of Biolog phenotypic microarrays, revealed resistance to pentamidine in ATCC 17978 and mutants could be altered by bioavailability of iron or utilization of different carbon sources. In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that AdeAB in ATCC 17978 can confer intrinsic resistance to a subset of dicationic compounds and in particular, resistance to pentamidine can be significantly altered depending on the growth conditions.</description><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Felise G.

The Old World farming system arose in the semi-arid Mediterranean environments of southwest Asia. Pioneer farmers settling the interior of the Balkans by the early sixth millennium BC were among the first to introduce southwest Asian-style cultivation and herding into areas with increasingly continental temperate conditions. Previous research has shown that the bioarchaeological assemblages from early farming sites in southeast Europe vary in their proportions of plant and animal taxa, but the relationship between taxonomic variation and climate has remained poorly understood. To uncover associations between multiple species and environmental factors simultaneously, we explored a dataset including altitude, five bioclimatic and 30 bioarchaeological variables (plant and animal taxa) for 57 of the earliest farming sites in southeast Europe using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). An extension of correspondence analysis, CCA is widely used in applied ecology to answer similar questions of species-environment relationships, but has not been previously applied in prehistoric archaeology to explore taxonomic and climatic variables in conjunction. The analyses reveal that the changes in plant and animal exploitation which occurred with the northward dispersal of farmers, crops and livestock correlate with south-north climate gradients, and emphasize the importance of adaptations in the animal domain for the initial establishment of farming beyond the Mediterranean areas.</description><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Ivanova, Bea De Cupere, Jonathan Ethier, Elena Marinova&lt;/p&gt;

However, methods to quantify endogenous post-translational modifications (PTMs) are typically reliant on summary statistical methods that fail to consider sources of variability such as changes in levels of the parent protein. Here, we compare three multivariate regression methods, including a novel Bayesian elastic net algorithm (BayesENproteomics) that enables assessment of relative protein abundances while also quantifying identified PTMs for each protein. We tested the ability of these methods to accurately quantify expression of proteins in a mixed-species benchmark experiment, and to quantify synthetic PTMs induced by stable isotope labelling. Finally, we extended our regression pipeline to calculate fold changes at the pathway level, providing a complement to commonly used enrichment analysis.

Here, we compare three multivariate regression methods, including a novel Bayesian elastic net algorithm (BayesENproteomics) that enables assessment of relative protein abundances while also quantifying identified PTMs for each protein. We tested the ability of these methods to accurately quantify expression of proteins in a mixed-species benchmark experiment, and to quantify synthetic PTMs induced by stable isotope labelling. Finally, we extended our regression pipeline to calculate fold changes at the pathway level, providing a complement to commonly used enrichment analysis. Our results show that BayesENproteomics can quantify changes to protein levels across a broad dynamic range while also accurately quantifying PTM and pathway-level fold changes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525935600000</published><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/10/295527</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1634ab9068b:14d516f:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Banerjee, A.</name></author><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332965v1?rss=1</originId><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>72e666de</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332965v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Identification and design of vinyl sulfone inhibitors against Cryptopain1, which is a cysteine protease from cryptosporidiosis causingCryptosporidium parvum [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332965v1?rss=1</link><description>Cryptosporidiosis, a disease marked by diarrhea in adults and stunted growth in children, is associated with the unicellular protozoan pathogen Cryptosporidium; often the species parvum. Cryptopain1, a cysteine protease characterized in the genome of Cryptosporidium parvum, had been earlier shown to be inhibited by a vinyl sulfone compound called K11777 (or K777). Cysteine proteases have long been established as valid drug targets, which can be covalently and selectively inhibited by vinyl sulfones. This computational study was initiated to identify purchasable vinyl sulfone compounds, which could possibly inhibit cryptopain1 with higher efficacy than K11777. Docking simulations screened a number of such possibly better inhibitors. The work was furthered to probe the enzymatic pocket of cryptopain1, through in-silico mutations, to derive a map of receptor-ligand interactions in the docked complexes. The idea was to provide crucial clues to aid the design of inhibitors, which would be able to bind the protease well by making favorable interactions with important residues of the enzyme. The analyses dictated placement of ligands towards the front of the enzymatic cleft, and disfavored interactions deep within. The S1 prime and S2 subsites of the enzyme preferred to remain occupied by polar ligand subgroups. Reasonably distanced ring systems and polar backbones of ligands were desired across the cleft. Large as well as inflexible subgroups were not tolerated. Double ringed systems such as substituted napthalene, especially in S1, were exceptions though. The S2 subsite, which is typically a specificity determinant in papain (C1) family cysteine proteases such as cathepsin L like cryptopain1, can possibly accommodate polar and hydrophobic ligand subgroups alike.</description><crawled>1527602834647</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>Cryptosporidiosis, a disease marked by diarrhea in adults and stunted growth in children, is associated with the unicellular protozoan pathogen Cryptosporidium; often the species parvum.

Herbivores can modify the rate of shrub and treeline advance. Both direct and indirect effects of herbivory may simultaneously interact to affect the growth rates of plants at this ecotone. We investigated the effect of snowshoe hare herbivory on the height of white spruce at two treeline locations in Alaska, USA. White spruce is expanding its distribution both upwards in elevation and northward in latitude because of climate warming, and snowshoe hares are already present in areas likely to be colonized by spruce. We hypothesized that herbivory would result in browsed individuals having reduced height, suggesting herbivory is a direct, negative effect on spruce treeline advance. We found an interactive effect between browsing history and spruce age. When young (under 30 years old), individuals that were browsed tended to be taller than unbrowsed individuals. However, older seedlings (over 30 years old) that had been browsed were shorter than unbrowsed individuals of the same age. Hares suppress faster growing individuals that are initially taller by preferentially browsing them as they emerge above the winter snowpack. This reduced height, in combination with increased mortality associated with browsing, is predicted to slow the advance of both latitudinal and altitudinal treeline expansions and alter the structure of treeline forests.</description><crawled>1527876013672</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Justin Olnes, Knut Kielland, Hélène Genet, Glenn P.

The white-backed planthopper, &lt;i&gt;Sogatella furcifera&lt;/i&gt;, is a phloem sap feeder that secretes watery and gelling saliva during feeding. In this study, we identified the major proteins in watery saliva of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;furcifera&lt;/i&gt; by shotgun LC-MS/MS analysis combined with transcriptomic analysis. A total of 161 proteins were identified, which were divided into 8 function categories, including enzymes, transporter, calcium ion binding protein, salivary sheath protein, cytoskeleton protein, DNA-, RNA-, and protein-binding or regulating proteins, other non-enzyme proteins and unknown proteins. Gene expression pattern of 11 secretory proteins were analyzed by real time quantitative-PCR.

Purkinje neuron dendritic degeneration precedes cell loss in cerebellar ataxia, but the basis for dendritic vulnerability in ataxia remains poorly understood. Recent work has suggested that potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channel dysfunction and consequent spiking abnormalities contribute to Purkinje neuron degeneration, but little attention has been paid to how K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel dysfunction impacts dendritic excitability and the role this may play in the degenerative process. We examined the relationship between K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel dysfunction, dendritic excitability and dendritic degeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Examination of published RNA sequencing data from SCA1 mice revealed reduced expression of several K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels that are important regulators of excitability in Purkinje neuron dendrites. Patch clamp recordings in Purkinje neurons from SCA1 mice identified increased dendritic excitability in the form of enhanced back-propagation of action potentials and an increased propensity to produce dendritic calcium spikes. Dendritic excitability could be rescued by restoring expression of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels and activating other K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels with baclofen. Importantly, this treatment combination improves motor performance and mitigates dendritic degeneration in SCA1 mice. These results suggest that reduced expression of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels results in persistently increased dendritic excitability at all stages of disease in SCA1, which in turn may contribute to the dendritic degeneration that precedes cell loss.</description><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ravi Chopra, David D.

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can harm the embryonic development and cause life-long consequences in offspring’s health. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of PAE we have used a mouse model of early alcohol exposure, which is based on maternal &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; ingestion of 10% (v/v) ethanol for the first eight days of gestation (GD 0.5–8.5). Owing to the detected postnatal growth-restricted phenotype in the offspring of this mouse model and both prenatal and postnatal growth restriction in alcohol-exposed humans, we focused on imprinted genes &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like growth factor 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Igf2)&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide N&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Paternally expressed gene 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Peg3)&lt;/i&gt;, which all are known to be involved in embryonic and placental growth and development. We studied the effects of alcohol on DNA methylation level at the &lt;i&gt;Igf2/H19&lt;/i&gt; imprinting control region (ICR), &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; differentially methylated region 1, &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; ICR and &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; ICR in 9.5 embryonic days old (E9.5) embryos and placentas by using MassARRAY EpiTYPER. To determine alcohol-induced alterations globally, we also examined methylation in long interspersed nuclear elements (Line-1) in E9.5 placentas. We did not observe any significant alcohol-induced changes in DNA methylation levels. We explored effects of PAE on gene expression of E9.5 embryos as well as E9.5 and E16.5 placentas by using quantitative PCR. The expression of growth promoter gene &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; was decreased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas. The expression of negative growth controller &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt; was significantly increased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos compared to controls, and conversely, a trend of decreased expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas were observed. Furthermore, increased &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos was also detected. Our study indicates that albeit no alterations in the DNA methylation levels of studied sequences were detected by EpiTYPER, early PAE can affect the expression of imprinted genes in both developing embryo and placenta.</description><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Heidi Marjonen, Mia Toivonen, Laura Lahti, Nina Kaminen-Ahola&lt;/p&gt;

Our study indicates that albeit no alterations in the DNA methylation levels of studied sequences were detected by EpiTYPER, early PAE can affect the expression of imprinted genes in both developing embryo and placenta.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526418000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</canonicalUrl><author><name>Heidi Marjonen</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b90:93d646dc</id></item><item><engagement>758</engagement><engagementRate>14.58</engagementRate><author><name>Goulson, D., 232 signatories</name></author><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/973-a?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>83d79a5c</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/973-a?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Call to restrict neonicotinoids</title><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1527788426000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/973-a?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/973.1.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d09b7:2835af05</id></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197396</originId><updated>1525899600000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197396</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>303bf32b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197396</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><title>Correction: Effects of a Possible Pollinator Crisis on Food Crop Production in Brazil</title><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel M.

Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of the human cornea is crucial for understanding the development of corneal diseases and impact of surgical treatments (e.g., corneal laser surgery, corneal cross-linking). Using a Surface Force Apparatus we investigated the transient viscous response of the anterior cornea from donor human eyes compressed between macroscopic crossed cylinders. Corneal biomechanics was analyzed using linear viscoelastic theory and interpreted in the framework of a biphasic model of soft hydrated porous tissues, including a significant contribution from the pressurization and viscous flow of fluid within the corneal tissue. Time-resolved measurements of tissue deformation and careful determination of the relaxation time provided an elastic modulus in the range between 0.17 and 1.43 MPa, and fluid permeability of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/(N∙s). The permeability decreased as the deformation was increased above a strain level of about 10%, indicating that the interstitial space between fibrils of the corneal stromal matrix was reduced under the effect of strong compression. This effect may play a major role in determining the observed rate-dependent non-linear stress-strain response of the anterior cornea, which underlies the shape and optical properties of the tissue.</description><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Zappone, Navinkumar J.

Because these kinases exhibit constitutive activity in biochemical assays, it is likely that their activity in cells is controlled by subcellular localization, interactions with inhibitory proteins, targeted degradation, or combinations of these mechanisms. We identified members of the FAM83 family of proteins as partners of CK1 in cells. All eight members of the FAM83 family (FAM83A to FAM83H) interacted with the α and α-like isoforms of CK1; FAM83A, FAM83B, FAM83E, and FAM83H also interacted with the and isoforms of CK1. We detected no interaction between any FAM83 member and the related CK11, CK12, and CK13 isoforms. Each FAM83 protein exhibited a distinct pattern of subcellular distribution and colocalized with the CK1 isoform(s) to which it bound. The interaction of FAM83 proteins with CK1 isoforms was mediated by the conserved domain of unknown function 1669 (DUF1669) that characterizes the FAM83 family. Mutations in FAM83 proteins that prevented them from binding to CK1 interfered with the proper subcellular localization and cellular functions of both the FAM83 proteins and their CK1 binding partners.

Q fever vaccine uptake among veterinary nurses in Australia is low, suggesting veterinarians are not recommending the vaccination to veterinary personnel. This study aimed to determine the willingness of veterinarians to recommend Q fever vaccination to veterinary personnel and to identify factors influencing Q fever vaccine uptake by veterinary nurses in Australia. An online cross sectional survey targeted veterinarians and veterinary nurses in Australia in 2014. Responses were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Factors significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with a willingness to recommend the vaccination, expressed by 35% (95% CI 31–38%) of veterinarians (n = 828), were (1) being very concerned for colleagues regarding &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; (OR 4.73), (2) disagreeing the vaccine is harmful (OR 3.80), (3) high Q fever knowledge (OR 2.27), (4) working within small animal practice (OR 1.67), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.55), and (6) age, with veterinarians under 39 years most likely to recommend vaccination. Of the veterinary nursing cohort who reported a known Q fever vaccination status (n = 688), 29% (95% CI 26–33%) had sought vaccination.

Q fever vaccine uptake among veterinary nurses in Australia is low, suggesting veterinarians are not recommending the vaccination to veterinary personnel. This study aimed to determine the willingness of veterinarians to recommend Q fever vaccination to veterinary personnel and to identify factors influencing Q fever vaccine uptake by veterinary nurses in Australia. An online cross sectional survey targeted veterinarians and veterinary nurses in Australia in 2014. Responses were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Factors significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with a willingness to recommend the vaccination, expressed by 35% (95% CI 31–38%) of veterinarians (n = 828), were (1) being very concerned for colleagues regarding &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; (OR 4.73), (2) disagreeing the vaccine is harmful (OR 3.80), (3) high Q fever knowledge (OR 2.27), (4) working within small animal practice (OR 1.67), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.55), and (6) age, with veterinarians under 39 years most likely to recommend vaccination. Of the veterinary nursing cohort who reported a known Q fever vaccination status (n = 688), 29% (95% CI 26–33%) had sought vaccination. This was significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with (1) agreeing the vaccine is important (OR 8.34), (2) moderate/high Q fever knowledge (OR 5.51), (3) working in Queensland (OR 4.00), (4) working within livestock/mixed animal practice (OR 3.24), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.86), (6) strong reliance on work culture for biosecurity information (OR 2.5), (7) perceiving personal exposure to &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; to be at least low/moderate (OR 2.14), and (8) both agreeing the vaccine is safe and working within a corporate practice structure (OR 4.28). The study identified the need for veterinarians to take greater responsibility for workplace health and safety promotion, and calls for better education of veterinary personnel to raise awareness of the potential for occupational exposure to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burnetii&lt;/i&gt; and improve the perception of the Q fever vaccine as being important, safe and cost-effective.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527886800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198421</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198421</canonicalUrl><author><name>Emily Sellens</name></author><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf3:3dd877af</id></item></channel></rss>
