Background &lt;p&gt;The comparison between long acting insulin analogues (LAIA) and human insulin (NPH) has been investigated for decades, with many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews giving mixed results. This overlapping and contradictory evidence has increased uncertainty on coverage decisions at health systems level.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To conduct an overview of systematic reviews and update existing reviews, preparing new meta-analysis to determine whether LAIA are effective for T1D patients compared to NPH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified systematic reviews of RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of LAIA glargine or detemir, compared to NPH insulin for T1D, assessing glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and hypoglycemia. Data sources included Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and hand-searching. The methodological quality of studies was independently assessed by two reviewers, using AMSTAR and Jadad scale. We found 11 eligible systematic reviews that contained a total of 25 relevant clinical trials. Two reviewers independently abstracted data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found evidence that LAIA are efficacious compared to NPH, with estimates showing a reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia episodes (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.57; 0.76) and A1C (95% CI 0.23; 0.12). No significance was found related to severe hypoglycemia (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.71; 1.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study design has allowed us to carry out the most comprehensive assessment of RCTs on this subject, filling a gap in diabetes research.

Transcription as the key step in gene expression is a highly regulated process. The speed of transcription elongation depends on the underlying gene sequence and varies on a gene by gene basis. The reason for this sequence dependence is not known in detail. Recently, our group studied the cross talk between the nascent RNA and the transcribing RNA polymerase by screening the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; genome for RNA sequences with high affinity to RNA Pol by performing genomic SELEX. This approach led to the identification of RNA polymerase-binding APtamers termed “RAPs”. RAPs can have positive and negative effects on gene expression. A subgroup is able to downregulate transcription via the activity of the termination factor Rho. In this study, we used a similar SELEX setup using yeast genomic DNA as source of RNA sequences and highly purified yeast RNA Pol II as bait and obtained almost 1300 yeast-derived RAPs. Yeast RAPs are found throughout the genome within genes and antisense to genes, they are overrepresented in the non-transcribed strand of yeast telomeres and underrepresented in intergenic regions. Genes harbouring a RAP are more likely to show lower mRNA levels. By determining the endogenous expression levels as well as using a reporter system, we show that RAPs located within coding regions can reduce the transcript level downstream of the RAP. Here we demonstrate that RAPs represent a novel type of regulatory RNA signal in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; that act in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and interfere with the elongating transcription machinery to reduce the transcriptional output.</description><updated>1521838800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</canonicalUrl><title>Nascent RNA signaling to yeast RNA Pol II during transcription elongation</title><published>1521838800000</published><fingerprint>a37b0dbb</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eva Klopf, Murielle Moes, Fabian Amman, Bob Zimmermann, Frederike von Pelchrzim, Christina Wagner, Renée Schroeder&lt;/p&gt;

After all, messing around with that is what keeps everyone in the drug industry employed, and the unmessed varieties of such binding events are what keep us all vertical and above room temperature, so it’s a worthy subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental picture is of two proteins adopting complementary shapes along some kinds of binding surfaces. “Complementary” is doing a lot of work in that sentence, though, because we could be talking about hydrophobic interactions (whatever those are), hydrogen bonding, or outright charged residues that are pairing up positive/negative. In fact, since we’re talking about proteins here, all of these can be operating at the same time, and probably are. And there are all sorts of entropic/enthalpic things going on, too – things are happening to water molecules at the surface of the proteins as they come together (as well as to the bulk water that used to be between them), parts of each protein are probably moving around and getting more or less constrained, other internal interactions within each partner are adjusting, etc. It’s a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s still a somewhat orderly mess. In the end, these two complex three-dimensional shapes have found some sort of defined relationship that’s overall lower-energy than what they started with, and now this is their new shape. What if that’s not the case, though? This unnerving thought is brought on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25762&quot;&gt;by this paper&lt;/a&gt;, published late last month in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. We’re talking intrinsically disordered proteins again – those beasts, rather more common than was once thought, that have large sections of them that have no particular defined shape at all. (Indeed, some of them are disordered from snout to tail). I’ve generally thought of these, though, as flopping around in that way until they encounter a binding partner, at which point they settle down into some defined shape and slot themselves obligingly into my &lt;em&gt;weltanschauung&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As should have been quite clear by now, though, proteins don’t care what I think about them. This paper shows a particular protein interaction (between histone H1 and prothymosin-alpha) that is down in the picomolar affinity range. The histone protein has a small structured region in the middle, but the N- and C-terminals head off into complete disorder. Prothymosin is disordered all the way through. If you’d asked me about this at one time, I would have been certain that this sort of binding required the formation of a solid, well-defined structure with plenty of clear interactions. But that’s not what’s going on. The paper shows that &lt;em&gt;both proteins are still disordered even as a complex.&lt;/em&gt; In the NMR, you can see the structured globular part of the histone, but that’s the only order in sight. The circular dichroism spectra reflect this as well – the complex, in fact, is just the CD spectra of the two partners added on top of each other, with no sign of induced helicity, etc. The team did a whole series of FRET experiments, attaching the partner groups on a number of different residues, and there’s really no pattern to it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the interaction? Sheer charge. The partners are strongly positive/strongly negative, but they don’t seem to care what residues associate with what. Doubling the ionic strength of the buffer decreases the binding constant by &lt;em&gt;six orders of magnitude&lt;/em&gt;, so yeah, it’s pretty much an ionic thing all the way. They’re just shifting around unfolded on a 100ns-timescale, with no apparent need for anything more organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were already signs that something like this was going on. Such histone protein tails had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbc.org/content/281/4/1853&quot;&gt;already been shown&lt;/a&gt;, most disconcertingly, to bind their protein partners even when their sequences had been scrambled, and they’re not the only proteins that have demonstrated such behavior. It makes sense: if you don’t got no defined structure, you don’t need no defined sequence, right? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096800040700285X?via%3Dihub#bib11&quot;&gt;Here’s a good try&lt;/a&gt; at classifying protein binding along scales of static/dynamic and order/disorder, with this latest example falling thoroughly into the “dynamic disordered” quadrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should we think about this stuff? Well, for now, I’m modeling this in my head as “proteins have all sorts of binding modes that fit different needs in the cell”. There are some, obviously, that need pretty hard, defined structures both at their interface and in the other parts of the protein. There are some where a protein’s ordered regions bind other ordered regions, with disordered parts still boogieing around, and others where a totally disordered protein folds one end of its structure up into an ordered complex while still leaving the far end loose. All of that I’ve been able to handle without much problem. But, as this latest paper shows, we have to stretch this concept to include “disordered binding” itself. In these cases, I suppose that the key event is just bringing these proteins together somehow, without so much need for three-dimensional perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, it looks like these sorts of disordered binding modes may be a lot more common in the proteome than any of us thought. We’re all going to have to accommodate that reality, apparently. Are we going to be able to attack such things with small molecules, though? I have to say that given the choice, I would try something else first. With a disordered protein we’ve always been able to make the argument that binding something to it in its unstructured state might throw its conformational manifold off enough to disturb its function – and of course, targeting it in a structured binding complex is always theoretically possible right up front. But picomolar-level binding that has no defined structure at the binding interface? I will read about this with interest, and I will think about its implications, but I would not like to lead a drug discovery project against it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13346</link></item><item><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16248a2666c:3654e09:34f43e70</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32332</originId><description>Understanding the molecular basis that underlies the expansion of the neocortex during primate, and notably human, evolution requires the identification of genes that are particularly active in the neural stem and progenitor cells of the developing neocortex.

Tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, requires two phosphorylation steps to form a competitive inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. Adenylate kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;) has been previously demonstrated to phosphorylate tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate, while creatine kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;), pyruvate kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;) and pyruvate kinase, liver and red blood cell (&lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt;) each have been found to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to the pharmacologically active tenofovir-diphosphate. In the present study, genomic DNA isolated from dried blood spots collected from 505 participants from Bangkok, Thailand; Cape Town, South Africa; and New York City, USA were examined for variants in &lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt; using next-generation sequencing. The bioinformatics tools SIFT and PolyPhen predicted that 19 of the 505 individuals (3.7% frequency) carried variants in at least one kinase that would result in a decrease or loss of enzymatic activity. To functionally test these predictions, AK2 and AK2 variants were expressed in and purified from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, followed by investigation of their activities towards tenofovir. Interestingly, we found that purified AK2 had the ability to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to tenofovir-diphosphate in addition to phosphorylating tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate. Further, four of the six AK2 variants predicted to result in a loss or decrease of enzyme function exhibited a ≥30% decrease in activity towards tenofovir in our in vitro assays. Of note, an AK2 K28R variant resulted in a 72% and 81% decrease in the formation of tenofovir-monophosphate and tenofovir-diphosphate, respectively. These data suggest that there are naturally occurring genetic variants that could potentially impact TFV activation.</description><updated>1523480400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</canonicalUrl><title>Discovery of genetic variants of the kinases that activate tenofovir among individuals in the United States, Thailand, and South Africa: HPTN067</title><published>1523480400000</published><fingerprint>9a832a89</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dominique B.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Qualitative studies indicated that cancer survivors may be worried about finding a partner in the future, but whether this concern is warranted is unknown. We examined single people´s interest in dating a cancer survivor, how they perceive survivors’ traits, and their preferences about the timing of disclosing a cancer history.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In three experimental vignette studies, dating website members (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 324) and college students (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 138 and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 131) were randomly assigned to a vignette of a person with or without a history of cancer (experiment 1 &amp;amp; 2), or a cancer survivor beyond or during active follow-up (experiment 3). Respondents rated their interest in dating this fictive person, this person’s traits, and indicated their preferences about the timing of disclosure. ANOVAs with main and interaction effects of condition, gender, and relationship history were conducted, partial eta squared and Cohen’s &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; were used to estimate the magnitude of effects. Correlations were used to investigate relationships between interest in a date and assessment of traits.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors’ traits were assessed more positively, but interest to date them did not differ from healthy vignettes for both men and women. However, widowed respondents were much less interested in a date with a cancer survivor, and women showed less interest in a cancer survivor during active follow-up relative to survivors beyond follow-up. Most respondents wanted to hear about the cancer diagnosis after a few dates, hardly anyone wanted to hear about this before the first date (2% - 5%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion and implications for cancer survivors &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors do not have to expect any more problems in finding a date than people without a cancer history, and can wait a few dates before disclosing. Survivors dating widowed people and survivors in active follow-up could expect more hesitant reactions and should disclose earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1521752400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194277</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194277</canonicalUrl><title>Do single people want to date a cancer survivor?

The present scheme is successfully applied to the diffusion of Ar–Ar pair in liquid Ar and ethylene carbonate (EC)‐Li+ pair in 1 M LiPF6/EC electrolyte solution. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25219?af=R</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522925554799</crawled><title>Time‐dependent pair distribution functions based on Smoluchowski equation and application to an electrolyte solution</title><published>1522463502000</published><fingerprint>3a453cf7</fingerprint><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>KentoKasahara

Introduction &lt;p&gt;HIV-1 dual infection is a condition that results from infection with at least two HIV-1 variants from different sources. The scarceness of information on this condition is partly due to the fact that its detection is technically challenging. Using next-generation sequencing we defined the extent of HIV-1 dual infection in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM).&lt;/p&gt; Material &amp;amp; methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-six MSM, diagnosed with HIV-1 subtype B infection between 2008 and 2013 were selected for next-generation sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;envelope&lt;/i&gt; V3. Sequencing was performed on 2 plasma samples collected with an interval of &gt; 6 months before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inspected for dual infection, defined as the presence of two or more monophyletic clusters with ≥ 90% bootstrap support and a mean between-cluster genetic distance of ≥ 10%. To confirm dual infection, deep V3 sequencing of intermediate samples was performed as well as clonal sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;protease-reverse transcriptase&lt;/i&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five of the 74 patients (6.8%) for whom deep sequencing was successful, showed clear evidence of dual infection. In 4 of them, the second strain was absent in the first sample but occurred in subsequent samples. This was highly suggestive for superinfection. In 3 patients both virus variants were of subtype B, in 2 patients at least one of the variants was a subtype B/non-B recombinant virus.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Dual infection was confirmed in 6.8% of MSM diagnosed with HIV-1 in Belgium.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). Natural killer cell responses play a crucial role in autoimmune disease through innate immunity, in which killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are closely involved. Although the genetic combination of KIRs with their specific HLA class I ligands has been associated with IBD in Caucasians, such KIR-HLA receptor-ligand combinations are not fully understood in the Japanese. We investigated 14 KIR genes along with HLA-Bw and -C ligands in 90 patients with UC and 50 patients with CD and compared them with the characteristics of 325 healthy control subjects. The frequency of HLA-Bw4 was significantly increased in patients with UC (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;; odds ratio [OR] = 3.39) and CD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0065; OR = 2.32) versus controls. The UC group had a significantly higher frequency of KIR2DS3 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024; OR = 1.94) and lower frequency of KIR2DS4 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019; OR = 0.40) and KIR2DL1-HLA-C2 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.035; OR = 0.47). The Tel-A/B haplotype was significantly decreased in UC patients (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0056; OR = 0.49). The frequency of KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 was significantly higher in patients with UC (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 4.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;; OR = 3.12) and CD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0067; OR = 2.30).

Detection of epistatic interactions still remains a challenge due to the large number of features and relatively small sample size as input, thus leading to the so-called &amp;quot;short fat data&amp;quot; problem. The efficiency of machine learning methods can be increased by limiting the number of input features. Thus, it is very important to perform variable selection before searching for epistasis. Many methods have been evaluated and proposed to perform feature selection, but no single method works best in all scenarios. We demonstrate this by conducting two separate simulation analyses to evaluate the proposed collective feature selection approach. Results: Through our simulation study we propose a collective feature selection approach to select features that are in the &amp;quot;union&amp;quot; of the best performing methods. We explored various parametric, non-parametric, and data mining approaches to perform feature selection. We choose our top performing methods to select the union of the resulting variables based on a user-defined percentage of variants selected from each method to take to downstream analysis. Our simulation analysis shows that non-parametric data mining approaches, such as MDR, may work best under one simulation criteria for the high effect size (penetrance) datasets, while non-parametric methods designed for feature selection, such as Ranger and Gradient boosting, work best under other simulation criteria. Thus, using a collective approach proves to be more beneficial for selecting variables with epistatic effects also in low effect size datasets and different genetic architectures. Following this, we applied our proposed collective feature selection approach to select the top 1% of variables to identify potential interacting variables associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in ~44,000 samples obtained from Geisinger&apos;s MyCode Community Health Initiative (on behalf of DiscovEHR collaboration). Conclusions: In this study, we were able to show that selecting variables using a collective feature selection approach could help in selecting true positive epistatic variables more frequently than applying any single method for feature selection via simulation studies. We were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of collective feature selection along with a comparison of many methods in our simulation analysis.

Random fluctuations in the amount of cellular components like mRNA and protein molecules are inevitable due to the stochastic and discrete nature of biochemical reactions. If large enough, this so-called “cellular noise” can lead to random transitions between the expression states of a multistable genetic circuit. That way, heterogeneity within isogenic populations is created. Our aim is to understand which dynamical features of a simple autoregulatory system determine its intrinsic noise level, and how they can be modified in order to regulate state-transitions. To that end, novel mathematical methods for the state-dependent characterization and prediction of noise in multistable systems are developed. First, we introduce the hybrid LNA, a modified version of the Linear Noise Approximation. It yields good predictions on variances of mRNA and protein fluctuations, even for reaction systems comprising low-copy-number components (e.g. mRNA) and highly nonlinear reaction rates. Furthermore, the temporal structure of fluctuations and the skewness of the protein distribution are characterized via state-dependent protein burst sizes and burst frequencies. Based on this mathematical framework, we develop graphical methods which support the intuitive design of regulatory circuits with a desired noise pattern. The methods are then used to predict how overall noise in the system can be adapted, and how state-specific noise modifications are possible that allow, e.g., the generation of unidirectional transitions. Our considerations are validated by stochastic simulations. This way, a design of genetic circuits is possible that takes population heterogeneity into account and is valuable in applications of synthetic biology and biotechnology.

A common task is to accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a logarithmic fold change (LFC) in expression levels. When the counts of reads are low or highly variable in either or both conditions, the maximum likelihood estimates for the LFCs has high variance, leading to large estimates not representative of true differences, and poor ranking of genes by effect size. One approach is to introduce filtering thresholds and pseudocounts to exclude or moderate estimated LFCs. Filtering may result in a loss of genes from the analysis with true differences in expression across conditions, while pseudocounts provide a limited solution that needs to be adapted per dataset.

A common task is to accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a logarithmic fold change (LFC) in expression levels. When the counts of reads are low or highly variable in either or both conditions, the maximum likelihood estimates for the LFCs has high variance, leading to large estimates not representative of true differences, and poor ranking of genes by effect size. One approach is to introduce filtering thresholds and pseudocounts to exclude or moderate estimated LFCs. Filtering may result in a loss of genes from the analysis with true differences in expression across conditions, while pseudocounts provide a limited solution that needs to be adapted per dataset. Here, we propose the use of a heavy-tailed Cauchy prior distribution for effect sizes, which avoids the use of filter thresholds or pseudocounts.

Accurate viability assessment prior to transplantation could minimize organ discard. Rapid and accurate evaluation of intra-operative donor kidney biopsies is essential for determining which kidneys are eligible for transplantation. The criteria for accepting or rejecting donor kidneys relies heavily on pathologist determination of the percent of glomeruli (determined from a frozen section) that are normal and sclerotic. This percentage is a critical measurement that correlates with transplant outcome. Inter- and intra-observer variability in donor biopsy evaluation is, however, significant.

Metagenomics is a powerful tool for characterizing viral composition within environmental samples, but sample and molecular processing steps can bias the estimation of viral community structure. The objective of this study is to understand the inherent variability introduced when conducting viral metagenomic analyses of wastewater and provide a bioinformatic strategy to accurately analyze sequences for viral community analyses. A standard approach using a combination of ultrafiltration, membrane filtration, and DNase treatment, and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) produced DNA preparations without any bacterial derived genes. Results showed recoveries in wastewater matrix ranged between 60–100%. A bias towards small single stranded DNA (ssDNA; polyomavirus) virus types vs larger double stranded DNA (dsDNA; adenovirus) viruses was also observed with a total estimated recovery of small circular viruses to be as much as 173-fold higher. Notably, ssDNA abundance decreased with sample dilution while large dsDNA genomes (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Caudovirales&lt;/i&gt;) initially increased in abundance with dilution before gradually decreasing with further dilution in wastewater samples. The present study revealed the inherent biases associated with different components of viral metagenomic methods applied to wastewater. Overall, these results provide a well-characterized approach for effectively conducting viral metagenomics analysis of wastewater and reveal that dilution can effectively mitigate MDA bias.</description><updated>1522789200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195350</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195350</canonicalUrl><title>Reducing inherent biases introduced during DNA viral metagenome analyses of municipal wastewater</title><published>1522789200000</published><fingerprint>433d97fb</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nichole E.

Agricultural crops play an important role in the global carbon and water cycle. Global climate change scenarios predict enhanced water scarcity and altered precipitation pattern in many parts of the world. Hence, a mechanistic understanding of water fluxes, productivity and water use efficiency of cultivated crops is of major importance, i.e. to adapt management practices. We compared water and carbon fluxes of paddy and rainfed rice by canopy scale gas exchange measurements, crop growth, daily evapotranspiration, transpiration and carbon flux modeling. Throughout a monsoon rice growing season, soil evaporation in paddy rice contributed strongly to evapotranspiration (96.6% to 43.3% from initial growth to fully developed canopy and amounted to 57.9% of total water losses over the growing seasons. Evaporation of rainfed rice was significantly lower (by 65% on average) particularly before canopy closure. Water use efficiency (WUE) was significantly higher in rainfed rice both from an agronomic (WUE&lt;sub&gt;agro&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. grain yield per evapotranspiration) and ecosystem (WUE&lt;sub&gt;eco&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. gross primary production per evapotranspiration) perspective. However, our results also show that higher WUE in rainfed rice comes at the expense of higher respiration losses compared to paddy rice (26% higher on average). Hence, suggestions on water management depend on the regional water availability (i.e. Mediterranean vs. Monsoon climate) and the balance between higher respiratory losses versus a potential reduction in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gas emissions. Our results suggest that a shift from rainfed/unsaturated soil to waterlogged paddy conditions after closure of the rice canopy might be a good compromise towards a sustainable use of water while preserving grain yield, particularly for water-limited production areas.</description><updated>1523048400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195238</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><title>Quantifying differences in water and carbon cycling between paddy and rainfed rice (&amp;lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.) by flux partitioning</title><published>1523048400000</published><fingerprint>5630449</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bhone Nay‐Htoon, Wei Xue, Steve Lindner, Matthias Cuntz, Jonghan Ko, John Tenhunen, Christiane Werner, Maren Dubbert&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;A prospective Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program has been implemented in Korea to improve the quality and safety of medication use.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the influence of the DUR program in reducing incidence of preventable adverse drug reactions (pADRs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was performed using administrative data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA). The claims data for all adult patients with adverse drug events (ADE)-related diagnoses from 2009 to 2014 were obtained. Incidence rates of first-time and repeat pADRs prior to and after DUR program implementation were evaluated. Quarterly trends in incidence rates of overall ADE, allergic reactions, and ADRs were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data extraction covering the period from 2009 to 2014 led to the identification of 3,927,662 records. First-time pADR rates decreased gradually after implementation of the DUR program (change in slope: -0.016, p = 0.02). The program had a similar influence on repeat pADR rates (change in slope: -0.006, p≤0.01). The program did not decrease rates of first-time or repeat allergic reactions (change in slope: 0.018, p = 0.07 and 0.003, p = 0.04, respectively). In the cohort aged ≤65 years, first-time pADR rate reduction was significant (28.2% [27.1–29.3] in ≤18 years, and 19.8% [18.1–21.5] in 19–64 years). In contrast, first-time pADR rate was increased by 0.6% [-0.7–1.9] in patients ≥65 years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Implementation of the prospective DUR program effectively reduced the number of pADRs.

Extracted data were analyzed with STATA (version 14). The standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of each indicator were calculated using a random effect model. We also performed tests of heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, assessments of bias, and meta-regression in this meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 54 observational studies were included. By meta-analysis we found significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (9 studies, SMD 0.883, 95% CI 0.130 to 1.637, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 10 studies, SMD -0.133, 95% CI -0.512 to 0.246, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.429 in POCD) and interleukin (IL)-6 (7 studies, SMD 0.386, 95% CI 0.054 to 0.717, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 16 studies, SMD 0.089, 95% CI -0.133 to 0.311, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.433 in POCD) concentrations in both POD and POCD patients. We also found that the SMDs of CRP and IL-6 from POCD patients were positively correlated with surgery type in the meta-regression (CRP: Coefficient = 1.555365, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 10 studies; IL-6: Coefficient = -0.6455521, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.086, 16 studies).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Available evidence from medium-to-high quality observational studies suggests that POD and POCD are indeed correlated with the concentration of peripheral and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers.

Overall, we found an association between HC and psychotropic drugs (adjusted OR 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–1.37). In the age-stratified analysis, the strongest association was found in adolescent girls (adjusted OR 3.46, 95% CI 3.04–4.94 for age 12 to 14 years), while it was non-existent for adult women. We conclude that hormonal contraception is associated with psychotropic drug use among adolescent girls, suggesting an adverse effect of HC on psychological health in this population.</description><updated>1521752400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194773</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194773</canonicalUrl><title>Hormonal contraception increases the risk of psychotropic drug use in adolescent girls but not in adults: A pharmacoepidemiological study on 800 000 Swedish women</title><published>1521752400000</published><fingerprint>6b2f05c2</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Zettermark, Raquel Perez Vicente, Juan Merlo&lt;/p&gt;

Mirror exposure (ME) is one of the main components of the treatment of patients with eating disorders symptomatology and it has shown its effectiveness in improving several outcomes (e.g., body dissatisfaction). However, the study as to what body posture should be adopted to maximize its effectiveness has been neglected. From embodied cognition and emotion theories, the adoption of an expansive (vs. contractive) body posture has been associated with positive changes in cognitive and emotional responses. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of adopting an expansive (vs. contractive) posture before an ME task on body-related emotions and cognitions, as well as to analyze the possible moderator and mediator variables of these relationships. The sample was composed of 68 women (age: &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 21.74, &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 3.12) with high scores on body dissatisfaction. Participants were randomly assigned to the expansive or contractive condition, where the openness of the arms/legs and the back position were manipulated. Posture was monitored by an electronic device and participants filled out several self-reported measures. ANCOVAs, moderation, mediation, and moderated mediated analyses were performed.

Mirror exposure (ME) is one of the main components of the treatment of patients with eating disorders symptomatology and it has shown its effectiveness in improving several outcomes (e.g., body dissatisfaction). However, the study as to what body posture should be adopted to maximize its effectiveness has been neglected. From embodied cognition and emotion theories, the adoption of an expansive (vs. contractive) body posture has been associated with positive changes in cognitive and emotional responses. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of adopting an expansive (vs. contractive) posture before an ME task on body-related emotions and cognitions, as well as to analyze the possible moderator and mediator variables of these relationships. The sample was composed of 68 women (age: &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 21.74, &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 3.12) with high scores on body dissatisfaction. Participants were randomly assigned to the expansive or contractive condition, where the openness of the arms/legs and the back position were manipulated. Posture was monitored by an electronic device and participants filled out several self-reported measures. ANCOVAs, moderation, mediation, and moderated mediated analyses were performed. Results showed that women in the expansive condition showed higher positive emotions after the ME. Moreover, exploratory analyses showed that adopting an expansive posture improved positive emotions, leading to improvements in negative emotions, body image satisfaction, and appraisal of the person’s own body. Psychological interventions should explore the value of holding an expansive posture before the ME in women with body dissatisfaction.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Marta Miragall</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194686</link></item><item><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_1626d03ee40:6b468a1:9f3b30f2</id><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13409</originId><description>If you’re at all involved in producing solid forms of compounds, you’re familiar with the concept of a polymorph.

That, put simply, is a different crystalline form, and any given substance can have several. Or a lot more than several. I don’t know what the record is for any single compound, but it’s way up into the dozens, and you never know when a new one might show up. You can get these different forms through all sorts of variations in the way the compound is crystallized or precipitated: different solvents, different temperatures, different types of stirring (yes indeed), different concentrations. . .and we haven’t even gotten to hydrates and solvates, where molecules of water or other solvents are incorporated into the crystal structure as it forms. And &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; can have polymorphs in turn, or different ratios of water and solvent, and there’s just no end to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymorphs can behave completely differently from each other. The same substance, completely pure, can come out looking like several unmistakable crystal types (rods, prisms, plates), in different crystalline space groups, with completely different melting points and solubility behavior. Past blog posts on this are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/10/22/phenylalanine_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/08/25/polymorphs_and_salts_india_raises_an_eyebrow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2011/01/12/gassing_your_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/04/01/novartis_loses_the_glivec_patent_fight_in_india&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and as that last one illustrates, this is definitely not something of just theoretical interest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=17333&quot;&gt;The saga&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-HIV drug Ritonavir is the classic example. That altered solubility behavior is of tremendous importance for drug dosing, and in Ritonavir’s case, a more stable (and less desirable!) polymorph appeared and threatened to disrupt the entire supply of the drug, because after a while, it was appearing more and more in the production line. “More stable”, of course, can easily mean “so stable it would rather not dissolve and get into the bloodstream”. Polymorphs themselves can be patented separately over such meaningful differences, as can methods for their production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even very simple compounds can show grindingly complex behavior. Aspirin, for example, exists in two polymorphs (so far) that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.200603373&quot;&gt;so similar&lt;/a&gt; that they can both show up &lt;em&gt;in the same single crystal&lt;/em&gt;, and it takes good X-ray data (and a good X-ray crystallographer) to work out what’s going on. One of those past blog post links is about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/blog/post-42/&quot;&gt;trickiness of phenylalanine&lt;/a&gt;, a substance you’d think had been studied to pieces by now. But as that link shows, D-ribose is in the same category: the crystallographic literature for years was all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about something even more simple than those? I refer to the most simple amino acid of all, glycine. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/anie.201800741&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has some details on its polymorphs, and the ridiculously subtle effects that cause them to form. There are three that form under “normal” conditions from aqueous solution, and while the gamma one is the most thermodynamically stable, the alpha one is kinetically favored. Adding small amounts of simple alcohols to the aqueous solution starts producing mixtures of the alpha and beta forms, though, and eventually, as the alcohol concentration goes up, you only get the beta form. All classic polymorph behavior. But why? Here’s what the authors found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that the alpha-form starts growing in a pyramidal shape, just as it usually does, but then starts incorporating methanol-solvated glycine molecules into its growing lattice. This buries methanol molecules into the crystal as it continues forming, and creates zones of higher polarity because of the different orientation of those solvated glycines (and the slight deformations in the nearest neighbor glycine arrangements as well). The normal arrangement in the crystal is a sort of “canceled-out” glycine dimer, but that gets disrupted into a more polarizable form. That’s the origin of the pyroelectric effect they’re able to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this starts happening, that developing surface of the crystal ends up “poisoned”, as some molecular dynamic simulations suggest, by the methanols incorporated into the lattice. The new surface doesn’t recognize the usual glycine-dimer form so readily, and further growth is inhibited – you see truncated pyramids of the alpha-form that have stopped in their tracks. Meanwhile, the beta-form end up with one surface (a more hydrophilic one) similarly poisoned and inhibited, but another one (a more hydrophobic one) is totally unaffected, so the crystal grows more rapidly along that face and produces long rods of the beta-form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of detail answers some questions and raises others. There are probably all sorts of metastable crystal forms (and crystal surfaces) showing up in complex polymorph situations, and the ability to see and characterize these things will (as in this case) give us a better physical picture of what’s going on. But predicting such behavior is another thing entirely. You’d hope as we start to pile up enough detail that predictive power will start to emerge (hello, machine learning). That’s a reasonable hope, but there’s no reason that things have to work out that way. The whole “Big Data” effort across various sciences is putting that view of the world to the test, and sometimes it’s going to work out and sometimes it isn’t.

Radiation-induced lung damage is an important treatment-related toxicity after lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). After implementing a tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co magnetic-resonance image guided system, ViewRay&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, we compared the associated early radiological lung density changes to those associated with a linear accelerator (LINAC). Eight patients treated with the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system were matched 1:1 with patients treated with LINAC. Prescription doses were 52 Gy or 60 Gy in four fractions, and lung dose-volumetric parameters were calculated from each planning system. The first two follow-up computed tomography (CT) were co-registered with the planning CT through deformable registration software, and lung density was measured by isodose levels. Tumor size was matched between the two groups, but the planning target volume of LINAC was larger than that of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036). With regard to clinically relevant dose-volumetric parameters in the lungs, the ipsilateral lung mean dose, &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10Gy&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;20Gy&lt;/sub&gt; were significantly poorer in tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co plans compared to LINAC plans (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, 0.036, and 0.017, respectively). Increased lung density was not observed in the first follow-up scan compared to the planning scan. A significant change of lung density was shown in the second follow-up scan and there was no meaningful difference between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for all dose regions. In addition, no patient developed clinical radiation pneumonitis until the second follow-up scan. Therefore, there was no significant difference in the early radiological lung damage between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for lung SABR despite of the inferior plan quality of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system compared to that of LINAC.

Preservation of residual hearing after cochlear implant is an important issue with regards to hearing performance. Various methods of steroid administration have been widely used in clinical practice to reduce inflammation and preserve residual hearing. Here we compare the effect of different routes of dexamethasone administration on intracochlear inflammation and residual hearing in guinea pig ears. Dexamethasone was delivered into the guinea pigs either through intracochlear, intratympanic or systemic route. The intracochlear concentration of dexamethasone, residual hearing, inflammatory cytokines and histopathologic changes were evaluated over time. A higher intracochlear dexamethasone concentration was observed after intracochlear administration than through the other routes. Residual hearing was better preserved with local dexamethasone administration as was supported by the reduced inflammatory cytokines, more hair cell survival and less severe intracochlear fibrosis and ossification concurrently seen in the local delivery group than in the systemic group. The results demonstrate that local dexamethasone delivery can reduce intracochlear inflammation and preserve residual hearing better than in systemically administered dexamethasone.</description><updated>1522443600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195230</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195230</canonicalUrl><title>Effects of dexamethasone on intracochlear inflammation and residual hearing after cochleostomy: A comparison of administration routes</title><published>1522443600000</published><fingerprint>7d78ed53</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ah-Ra Lyu, Dong Hyun Kim, Seung Hun Lee, Dong-Sik Shin, Sun-Ae Shin, Yong-Ho Park&lt;/p&gt;

Thyroid hormone (TH) orchestrates amphibian metamorphosis. Thus, this developmental phase is often used to study TH-dependent responses in specific tissues. However, TH signaling appears early in development raising the question of the control of TH availability in specific cell types prior to metamorphosis. TH availability is under strict temporal and tissue-specific control by deiodinases. We examined the expression of the TH-inactivating enzyme, deiodinase type 3 (D3), during early retinal development. To this end we created a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; transgenic line expressing GFP from the Xenopus &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter region (p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;) and followed p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;–GFP expression in pre-metamorphic tadpoles. To validate retinal GFP expression in the transgenic line as a function of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter activity, we used &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to compare endogenous &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression to reporter-driven GFP activity. Retinal expression of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; increased during pre-metamorphosis through stages NF41, 45 and 48. Both sets of results show &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; to have cell-specific, dynamic expression in the pre-metamorphic retina. At stage NF48, &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression co-localised with markers for photoreceptors, rods, Opsin-S cones and bipolar neurons. In contrast, in post-metamorphic juveniles &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression was reduced and spatially confined to certain photoreceptors and amacrine cells. We compared &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression at stages NF41 and NF48 with TH-dependent transcriptional responses using another transgenic reporter line: &lt;i&gt;THbZIP&lt;/i&gt;-GFP and by analyzing the expression of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-regulated genes in distinct TH availability contexts. At stage NF48, the majority of retinal cells expressing &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; were negative for T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signaling. Notably, most ganglion cells were virtually both &lt;i&gt;dio3-&lt;/i&gt;free and T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-responsive. The results show that &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; can reduce TH availability at the cellular scale. Further, a reduction in &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression can trigger fine-tuned T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; action in cell-type specific maturation at the right time, as exemplified here in photoreceptor survival in the pre-metamorphic retina.</description><updated>1523480400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195374</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195374</canonicalUrl><title>Expression of the inactivating deiodinase, Deiodinase 3, in the pre-metamorphic tadpole retina</title><published>1523480400000</published><fingerprint>dff9ba9d</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Karine Le Blay, Laëtitia Préau, Ghislaine Morvan-Dubois, Barbara Demeneix&lt;/p&gt;

We examined the expression of the TH-inactivating enzyme, deiodinase type 3 (D3), during early retinal development. To this end we created a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; transgenic line expressing GFP from the Xenopus &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter region (p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;) and followed p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;–GFP expression in pre-metamorphic tadpoles. To validate retinal GFP expression in the transgenic line as a function of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter activity, we used &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to compare endogenous &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression to reporter-driven GFP activity. Retinal expression of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; increased during pre-metamorphosis through stages NF41, 45 and 48. Both sets of results show &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; to have cell-specific, dynamic expression in the pre-metamorphic retina. At stage NF48, &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression co-localised with markers for photoreceptors, rods, Opsin-S cones and bipolar neurons. In contrast, in post-metamorphic juveniles &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression was reduced and spatially confined to certain photoreceptors and amacrine cells. We compared &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression at stages NF41 and NF48 with TH-dependent transcriptional responses using another transgenic reporter line: &lt;i&gt;THbZIP&lt;/i&gt;-GFP and by analyzing the expression of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-regulated genes in distinct TH availability contexts. At stage NF48, the majority of retinal cells expressing &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; were negative for T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signaling. Notably, most ganglion cells were virtually both &lt;i&gt;dio3-&lt;/i&gt;free and T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-responsive. The results show that &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; can reduce TH availability at the cellular scale. Further, a reduction in &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression can trigger fine-tuned T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; action in cell-type specific maturation at the right time, as exemplified here in photoreceptor survival in the pre-metamorphic retina.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Karine Le Blay</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195374</link></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162aef7f1ab:1bf4338:9aea0a7d</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04258-2</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gentle ‘slow slip’ earthquakes belie hidden danger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentle ‘slow slip’ earthquakes belie hidden danger, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04258-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04258-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Fluid build-up after a slow quake raises the risk of massive rupture.</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><engagement>54</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04258-2</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523353907627</crawled><title>Gentle ‘slow slip’ earthquakes belie hidden danger</title><published>1523343600000</published><fingerprint>2b431706</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gentle ‘slow slip’ earthquakes belie hidden danger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentle ‘slow slip’ earthquakes belie hidden danger, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04258-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04258-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Fluid build-up after a slow quake raises the risk of massive rupture.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>NA</name></author><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04258-2</link><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04258-2/d41586-018-04258-2_15593330.jpg</url><height>576</height><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16282c07090:866c9e0:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/211698v3?rss=1</originId><description>High-throughput DNA sequencing enables detection of copy number variations (CNVs) on the genome-wide scale with finer resolution compared to array-based methods, but suffers from biases and artifacts that lead to false discoveries and low sensitivity.

Aims &lt;p&gt;In the current study we investigated the effects of resisted sprint training on sprinting performance and underlying mechanical parameters (force-velocity-power profile) based on two different training protocols: (i) loads that represented maximum power output (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt;) and a 50% decrease in maximum unresisted sprinting velocity and (ii) lighter loads that represented a 10% decrease in maximum unresisted sprinting velocity, as drawn from previous research (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Soccer [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15 male] and rugby [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21; 9 male and 12 female] club-level athletes were individually assessed for horizontal force-velocity and load-velocity profiles using a battery of resisted sprints, sled or robotic resistance respectively. Athletes then performed a 12-session resisted (10 × 20-m; and pre- post-profiling) sprint training intervention following the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; training protocols had minor effects on sprinting performance (average of -1.4 to -2.3% split-times respectively), and provided trivial, small and unclear changes in mechanical sprinting parameters. Unexpectedly, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; impacted velocity dominant variables to a greater degree than &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (trivial benefit in maximum velocity; small increase in slope of the force-velocity relationship), while &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; improved force and power dominant metrics (trivial benefit in maximal power; small benefit in maximal effectiveness of ground force orientation).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Both resisted-sprint training protocols were likely to improve performance after a short training intervention in already sprint trained athletes.

Terrestrial arthropods play an important role in saltmarsh ecosystems, mainly affecting the saltmarsh’s primary production as the main consumers of terrestrial primary production and decomposition. Some of these arthropods, including selected insects and spiders, can be used as ecological indicators of overall marsh environmental health, as they are differentially sensitive to ecological stressors, such as land loss, erosion, oil spills, and tropical storms. In the present study, we used terrestrial arthropods collected from seven (three lightly-oiled, four heavily-oiled) sites in Barataria Bay and from three unoiled reference sites in Delacroix, Louisiana, to determine the impacts of the distribution and re-distribution of &lt;i&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/i&gt; (DWH) oil on these saltmarsh ecosystems. A total of 9,476 and 12,256 insects were collected in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The results show that the terrestrial arthropods were negatively affected by the re-distribution of DWH oil by Hurricane Isaac in 2012, although the level of impacts varied among the arthropod groups. Moreover, the mean diversity index was higher (&gt;1.5) in 2014 than in 2013 (&amp;lt;1.5) for all sites, suggesting a recovery trajectory of the saltmarsh arthropod population. The higher taxonomic richness observed in the reference sites compared to the oiled sites for both years also indicated long-term impacts of DWH oil to the saltmarsh arthropod community. Whereas a slow recovery of certain terrestrial arthropods was observed, long-term monitoring of arthropod communities would help better understand the recovery and succession of the marsh ecosystems.</description><updated>1523480400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194941</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194941</canonicalUrl><title>Coupled effects of oil spill and hurricane on saltmarsh terrestrial arthropods</title><published>1523480400000</published><fingerprint>24bf6159</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wokil Bam, Linda M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Middle ear disease (otitis media) is endemic among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia and represents an important cause of hearing loss. The disease is the result of a mix of biological, environmental and host risk factors that interact in complex, non-linear ways along a dynamic continuum. As such, it is generally recognised that a holistic, systems approach is required to reverse the high rates of otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The objective of this paper is to examine the alignment between efforts designed to address otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Queensland, Australia and core concepts of systems thinking. This paper’s overall purpose is to identify which combination of activities, and at which level, hold the potential to facilitate systems changes to better support ear health among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We began with a review of documents identified in consultation with stakeholders and an online search. In addition, key informants were invited to participate in an online survey and a face-to-face or phone interview. Qualitative interviews using a semi-structured interview guide were used to explore survey responses in more depth. We also undertook interviews at the community level to elicit a diverse range of views. Ideas, statements or activities reported in the documents and interviews as being performed under the Intervention Level Framework were identified using qualitative thematic and content analysis. A quantitative descriptive analysis was also undertaken, whereby data was extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and coded under the relevant strategic directions and performance indicators of the Framework. Subsequently, we coded activities against the five-level intervention framework developed by Malhi and colleagues, that is: 1) paradigm; 2) goals; 3) system structure; 4) feedback and delays; and 5) structural elements.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, twenty documents were reviewed. We examined surveys and interviews with six key informants. Twenty-four individual and 3 group interviews were conducted across central and community level informants. One hundred and four items were coded from the 20 documents and 156 items from interview data. For both data sets, the majority of activities were coded at the structural elements level. The results suggested three key areas where further work is needed to drive sustained improvements: 1) build the governance structures needed for paradigm shift to achieve a multi-sectoral approach; 2) develop shared system level goals; 3) develop system-wide feedback processes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sustained progress in improving ear health within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children requires a holistic, system-wide approach. To advance such work, governance structures for multi-sectoral collaboration including the development of joint goals and monitoring and feedback are required. Intervening at these higher leverage points could have a profound effect on persistent public health issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1521666000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194275</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194275</canonicalUrl><title>Using systems thinking and the Intervention Level Framework to analyse public health planning for complex problems: Otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children</title><published>1521666000000</published><fingerprint>ea9b2d45</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jo Durham, Lisa Schubert, Lisa Vaughan, Cameron D.

Background &lt;p&gt;Middle ear disease (otitis media) is endemic among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia and represents an important cause of hearing loss. The disease is the result of a mix of biological, environmental and host risk factors that interact in complex, non-linear ways along a dynamic continuum. As such, it is generally recognised that a holistic, systems approach is required to reverse the high rates of otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The objective of this paper is to examine the alignment between efforts designed to address otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Queensland, Australia and core concepts of systems thinking.

Despite the widespread acceptance of rotary blood pump (RBP) in clinical use over the past decades, the diminished flow pulsatility generated by a fixed speed RBP has been regarded as a potential factor that may lead to adverse events such as vasculature stiffening and hemorrhagic strokes. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of generating physiological pulse pressure in the pulmonary circulation by modulating the speed of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) in a mock circulation loop. A rectangular pulse profile with predetermined pulse width has been implemented as the pump speed pattern with two different phase shifts (0% and 50%) with respect to the ventricular contraction. In addition, the performance of the speed modulation strategy has been assessed under different cardiovascular states, including variation in ventricular contractility and pulmonary arterial compliance. Our results indicated that the proposed pulse profile with optimised parameters (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt; = 10000 rpm and &lt;i&gt;ω&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = 3000 rpm) was able to generate pulmonary arterial pulse pressure within the physiological range (9–15 mmHg) while avoiding undesirable pump backflow under both co- and counter-pulsation modes. As compared to co-pulsation, stroke work was reduced by over 44% under counter-pulsation, suggesting that mechanical workload of the right ventricle can be efficiently mitigated through counter-pulsing the pump speed. Furthermore, our results showed that improved ventricular contractility could potentially lead to higher risk of ventricular suction and pump backflow, while stiffening of the pulmonary artery resulted in increased pulse pressure. In conclusion, the proposed speed modulation strategy produces pulsatile hemodynamics, which is more physiologic than continuous blood flow. The findings also provide valuable insight into the interaction between RVAD speed modulation and the pulmonary circulation under various cardiovascular states.</description><updated>1524258000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195975</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195975</canonicalUrl><title>Pulsatile operation of a continuous-flow right ventricular assist device (RVAD) to improve vascular pulsatility</title><published>1524258000000</published><fingerprint>d1e8c9a0</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Boon C.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an increasing public health concern because of rapid lifestyle changes. Although there have been previous studies on the prevalence of MS in China, the prevalence may have changed with lifestyle changes over the last decade. To update this prevalence, we performed a cross-sectional survey among adults over 18 years old across China from May 2013 to July 2014. Participants underwent questionnaires and provided blood and urine samples for analysis. MS was defined according to the criteria of the China Diabetes Society. A total of 12570 individuals (45.2% men) with an average age of 48.8±15.3 (18–96) years were selected and invited to participate in the study. In total, 9310 (40.7% men) individuals completed the investigation, with a response rate of 74.1%. The prevalence of MS in China was 14.39% [95% confidence interval (CI): -3.75–32.53%], and the age-adjusted prevalence was 9.82% (95% CI: 9.03–10.61%; 7.78% in men and 6.76% in women; 7.39% in rural residents and 6.98% in urban residents). The highest prevalence occurred among adults aged 50–59 years (1.95%, 95% CI: 1.40–2.50%), and the lowest prevalence occurred among adults aged 40–49 years (0.74%, 95% CI: 0.38–1.10%); the prevalence was the highest in the south region and lowest in the east region (4.46% and 1.23%, respectively). The results of logistic regression analyses showed that age, urolithiasis, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, thiazide drugs intake, family history of diabetes and hypertension were all significantly associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (OR&gt;1). In addition, education, vitamin D intake and family history of urolithiasis are all protective factors (OR&amp;lt;1). Our results indicate that there was a high prevalence of MS in Chinese adults. Compared to the previous study 10 years ago, some preventive strategies have worked; however, further work on the prevention and treatment of MS remains necessary.</description><updated>1524085200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524074227579</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</canonicalUrl><title>Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in China: An up-dated cross-sectional study</title><published>1524085200000</published><fingerprint>b664fda7</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Lan, Zanlin Mai, Shiyu Zhou, Yang Liu, Shujue Li, Zhijian Zhao, Xiaolu Duan, Cao Cai, Tuo Deng, Wei Zhu, Wenqi Wu, Guohua Zeng&lt;/p&gt;

Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bezier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wFWSqfInABw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Stephanie A.

To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bezier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wFWSqfInABw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37ab:9f3b30f2</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194491</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Magdalena Ewa Król&lt;/p&gt;
We investigated the effect of auditory noise added to speech on patterns of looking at faces in 40 toddlers. We hypothesised that noise would increase the difficulty of processing speech, making children allocate more attention to the mouth of the speaker to gain visual speech cues from mouth movements. We also hypothesised that this shift would cause a decrease in fixation time to the eyes, potentially decreasing the ability to monitor gaze. We found that adding noise increased the number of fixations to the mouth area, at the price of a decreased number of fixations to the eyes. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a mouth-eyes trade-off between attention allocated to social cues coming from the eyes and linguistic cues coming from the mouth. We also found that children with higher word recognition proficiency and higher average pupil response had an increased likelihood of fixating the mouth, compared to the eyes and the rest of the screen, indicating stronger motivation to decode the speech.</description><updated>1521579600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194491</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194491</canonicalUrl><title>Auditory noise increases the allocation of attention to the mouth, and the eyes pay the price: An eye-tracking study</title><published>1521579600000</published><fingerprint>4ebc6b18</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Magdalena Ewa Król&lt;/p&gt;

Alveolar epithelial cells are critical to the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which are associated with overexpression of type 2 cytokine IL-13. IL-13 is known to induce the production of profibrotic (e.g., periostin) and pro-inflammatory (e.g., eotaxin-3) mediators in human airway epithelial cells, but it remains unclear if human primary alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression following IL-13 stimulation. The goals of this study are to determine if alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression upon IL-13 stimulation, and if alveolar and airway epithelial cells from the same subjects have similar responses to IL-13. Paired alveolar and airway epithelial cells were isolated from donors without any lung disease, and cultured under submerged or air-liquid interface conditions with or without IL-13. Up-regulation of periostin protein and mRNA was observed in IL-13-stimulated alveolar epithelial cells, which was comparable to that in IL-13-stimulated paired airway epithelial cells. IL-13 also increased eotaxin-3 expression in alveolar epithelial cells, but the level of eotaxin mRNA was lower in alveolar epithelial cells than in airway epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that human alveolar epithelial cells are able to produce periostin and eotaxin in responses to IL-13 stimulation. This study suggests the need to further determine the contribution of alveolar epithelial cell-derived mediators to pulmonary fibrosis.</description><updated>1524171600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196256</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524160641534</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196256</canonicalUrl><title>IL-13 induces periostin and eotaxin expression in human primary alveolar epithelial cells: Comparison with paired airway epithelial cells</title><published>1524171600000</published><fingerprint>3c6ce039</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yoko Ito, Reem Al Mubarak, Nicole Roberts, Kelly Correll, William Janssen, James Finigan, Rangnath Mishra, Hong Wei Chu&lt;/p&gt;

Metrics to quantify child growth vary across studies of the developmental origins of health and disease. We conducted a scoping review of child growth studies in which length/height, weight or body mass index (BMI) was measured at ≥ 2 time points. From a 10% random sample of eligible studies published between Jan 2010-Jun 2016, and all eligible studies from Oct 2015-June 2016, we classified growth metrics based on author-assigned labels (e.g., ‘weight gain’) and a ‘content signature’, a numeric code that summarized the metric’s conceptual and statistical properties. Heterogeneity was assessed by the number of unique content signatures, and label-to-content concordance. In 122 studies, we found 40 unique metrics of childhood growth. The most common approach to quantifying growth in length, weight or BMI was the calculation of each child’s change in z-score. Label-to-content discordance was common due to distinct content signatures carrying the same label, and because of instances in which the same content signature was assigned multiple different labels. In conclusion, the numerous distinct growth metrics and the lack of specificity in the application of metric labels challenge the integration of data and inferences from studies investigating the determinants or consequences of variations in childhood growth.</description><updated>1521579600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194565</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194565</canonicalUrl><title>Metrics of early childhood growth in recent epidemiological research: A scoping review</title><published>1521579600000</published><fingerprint>34cbd772</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Leung, Nandita Perumal, Elnathan Mesfin, Aditi Krishna, Seungmi Yang, William Johnson, Diego G.

In this article, we follow the position and argue that post-alignment privacy is not enough and that data should be automatically protected as early as possible in the genomics workflow, ideally immediately after the data is produced. We show that a previous approach for filtering short reads cannot extend to long reads and present a novel filtering approach that classifies raw genomic data (i.e., whose location and content is not yet determined) into privacy-sensitive (i.e., more affected by a successful privacy attack) and non-privacy-sensitive information.

We present the first filter that can be indistinctly applied to reads of any length, i.e., making it usable with any recent or future sequencing technologies. The filter is accurate, in the sense that it detects all known sensitive nucleotides except those located in highly variable regions (less than 10 nucleotides remain undetected per genome instead of 100,000 in previous works). It has far less false positives than previously known methods (10% instead of 60%) and can detect sensitive nucleotides despite sequencing errors (86% detected instead of 56% with 2% of mutations).

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts. Surprisingly, our data show that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells are significantly enhanced in the genital tract TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice during mid-stage &lt;i&gt;Chlamydial&lt;/i&gt; infection. In late-stage infections, both mouse strains developed hydrosalpinx; however, the extent of hydrosalpinx was more severe in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Together, these data suggest that TLR3 promotes the clearance of &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; during early and mid-stages of genital tract infection, and that loss of TLR3 is detrimental in the development hydrosalpinx.</description><updated>1523048400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195165</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><title>Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) promotes the resolution of &amp;lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&amp;lt;/i&gt; genital tract infection in congenic C57BL/6N mice</title><published>1523048400000</published><fingerprint>a75a15bf</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sebastian E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are located in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene, are reported to be associated with body weight and the body mass index (BMI). However, their effects on anthropometric measurements in adolescents are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the association of three adjacent polymorphisms (rs9930506, rs9930501, &amp;amp; rs9932754) in the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene with anthropometric indices in Iranian adolescent males.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The participants comprised a total of 237 adolescent males who were recruited randomly from two high schools in Tehran, Iran. The DNA samples were genotyped for the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms by DNA sequencing. BMI, body fat percentage (BF%), and body muscle percentage (BM%) were determined using a validated bioelectrical impedance analysis scale.

Detailed knowledge of how a rider’s seating style and riding on a circle influences the movement symmetry of the horse’s head and pelvis may aid rider and trainer in an early recognition of low grade lameness. Such knowledge is also important during both subjective and objective lameness evaluations in the ridden horse in a clinical setting. In this study, inertial sensors were used to assess how different rider seating styles may influence head and pelvic movement symmetry in horses trotting in a straight line and on the circle in both directions. A total of 26 horses were subjected to 15 different conditions at trot: three unridden conditions and 12 ridden conditions where the rider performed three different seating styles (rising trot, sitting trot and two point seat). Rising trot induced systematic changes in movement symmetry of the horses.

Detailed knowledge of how a rider’s seating style and riding on a circle influences the movement symmetry of the horse’s head and pelvis may aid rider and trainer in an early recognition of low grade lameness. Such knowledge is also important during both subjective and objective lameness evaluations in the ridden horse in a clinical setting. In this study, inertial sensors were used to assess how different rider seating styles may influence head and pelvic movement symmetry in horses trotting in a straight line and on the circle in both directions. A total of 26 horses were subjected to 15 different conditions at trot: three unridden conditions and 12 ridden conditions where the rider performed three different seating styles (rising trot, sitting trot and two point seat). Rising trot induced systematic changes in movement symmetry of the horses. The most prominent effect was decreased pelvic rise that occurred as the rider was actively rising up in the stirrups, thus creating a downward momentum counteracting the horses push off. This mimics a push off lameness in the hindlimb that is in stance when the rider sits down in the saddle during the rising trot. On the circle, the asymmetries induced by rising trot on the correct diagonal counteracted the circle induced asymmetries, rendering the horse more symmetrical. This finding offers an explanation to the equestrian tradition of rising on the ‘correct diagonal.’ In horses with small pre-existing movement asymmetries, the asymmetry induced by rising trot, as well as the circular track, attenuated or reduced the horse’s baseline asymmetry, depending on the sitting diagonal and direction on the circle. A push off hindlimb lameness would be expected to increase when the rider sits during the lame hindlimb stance whereas an impact hindlimb lameness would be expected to decrease. These findings suggest that the rising trot may be useful for identifying the type of lameness during subjective lameness assessment of hindlimb lameness.

Background &lt;p&gt;Levothyroxine replacement treatment in hypothyroidism is unable to restore physiological thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations in serum and tissues completely. Normal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations reflect only pituitary euthyroidism and, therefore, novel biomarkers representing tissue-specific thyroid state are needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding regulatory RNAs, exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns and can be detectable in serum. Previous studies have demonstrated differential expression of (precursors of) miRNAs in tissues under the influence of thyroid hormone.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To study if serum miRNA profiles are changed in different thyroid states.&lt;/p&gt; Design and methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 13 athyroid patients (6 males) during TSH suppressive therapy and after 4 weeks of thyroid hormone withdrawal. A magnetic bead capture system was used to isolate 384 defined miRNAs from serum. Subsequently, the TaqMan Array Card 3.0 platform was used for profiling after individual target amplification.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age of the subjects was 44.0 years (range 20–61 years).

Background &lt;p&gt;In urban Maharashtra, India, approximately half of mothers exclusively breastfeed. For children residing in informal settlements of Mumbai, this study examines factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding, and whether exclusive breastfeeding, in a community-based nutrition program to prevent and treat wasting among children under age three, is associated with enrolment during the mother’s pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The nutrition program conducted a cross-sectional endline survey (October-December 2015) of caregivers in intervention areas. Factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding for infants under six months of age were explored using multi-level logistic regressions. Additionally, program surveillance data collected during home-based counselling visits documented breastfeeding practices for children under six months of age. Using the surveillance data (January 2014-March 2016), exclusive breastfeeding status was regressed adjusting for child, maternal and socioeconomic characteristics, and whether the child was enrolled in the program in utero or after birth.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The community-based endline survey included 888 mothers of infants. Mothers who received the nutrition program home visits or attended group counselling sessions were more likely to exclusively breastfeed (adjusted odds ratio 1.67, 95% CI 1.16, 2.41). Having a normal weight-for-height z-score (adjusted odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.00, 2.45) was associated positively with exclusive breastfeeding. As expected, being an older infant aged three to five months (adjusted odds ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.25, 0.48) and receiving a prelacteal feed after birth (adjusted odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.41, 0.80) were associated with lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding. Surveillance data (N = 3420) indicate that infants enrolled in utero have significantly higher odds of being exclusively breastfed (adjusted odds ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.30, 1.84) than infants enrolled after birth.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Prenatal enrolment in community-based programs working on child nutrition in urban informal settlements of India can improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1522962000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195619</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195619</canonicalUrl><title>Participation of pregnant women in a community-based nutrition program in Mumbai&apos;s informal settlements: Effect on exclusive breastfeeding practices</title><published>1522962000000</published><fingerprint>cee06caa</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sheila Chanani, Anagha Waingankar, Neena Shah More, Shanti Pantvaidya, Armida Fernandez, Anuja Jayaraman&lt;/p&gt;

Worldwide, 500,000 cases of head and neck cancer (HNC) are reported each year and the primary treatment for HNC is radiotherapy. Although the goal of radiotherapy is to target the tumor, secondary exposure occurs in surrounding normal tissues, such as the salivary glands. As a result, despite successful treatment of the cancer, patients are left with long-term side effects due to direct damage to the salivary glands. The effect is chronic and currently there is no treatment. Stem cells are an attractive therapeutic option for treatment of radiation-induced glandular dysfunction because of the potential to regenerate damaged cell populations and restore salivary gland function. However, limited knowledge about the endogenous stem cell population post irradiation hinders the development for stem cell-based therapies. In this study, an ex vivo sphere formation cell culture system was utilized to assess the self-renewal capacity of cells derived from parotid salivary glands at a chronic time point following radiation. Salivary glands from irradiated mice generate significantly fewer salispheres, but can be stimulated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to generate an equivalent number of salispheres as unirradiated salivary glands. Interestingly, the number and size of salispheres formed is dependent on the concentration of FBS supplemented into the media.

Worldwide, 500,000 cases of head and neck cancer (HNC) are reported each year and the primary treatment for HNC is radiotherapy. Although the goal of radiotherapy is to target the tumor, secondary exposure occurs in surrounding normal tissues, such as the salivary glands. As a result, despite successful treatment of the cancer, patients are left with long-term side effects due to direct damage to the salivary glands. The effect is chronic and currently there is no treatment. Stem cells are an attractive therapeutic option for treatment of radiation-induced glandular dysfunction because of the potential to regenerate damaged cell populations and restore salivary gland function. However, limited knowledge about the endogenous stem cell population post irradiation hinders the development for stem cell-based therapies. In this study, an ex vivo sphere formation cell culture system was utilized to assess the self-renewal capacity of cells derived from parotid salivary glands at a chronic time point following radiation. Salivary glands from irradiated mice generate significantly fewer salispheres, but can be stimulated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to generate an equivalent number of salispheres as unirradiated salivary glands. Interestingly, the number and size of salispheres formed is dependent on the concentration of FBS supplemented into the media. Salispheres derived from irradiated glands and cultured in FBS media were found to contain cells that proliferate and express progenitor and acinar cell markers such as Keratin 5, Keratin 14, Aquaporin 5, and NKCC1. Utilization of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) injections following radiation treatment restores salivary gland function and improves salisphere generation. These findings indicate that stimulation of these cellular populations may provide a promising avenue for the development of cell-based therapies for radiation-induced salivary gland damage.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Vicky T.

Sustained virological response (SVR) rates have increased remarkably since the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C. Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted enzyme converting lysophosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidic acid and a newly established biomarker for liver fibrosis. Interferon-free DAA regimens for chronic hepatitis C could improve liver stiffness in SVR patients according to several non-invasive evaluation methods, but the clinical response and significance of ATX in this context have not yet been defined. We therefore investigated sequential serum ATX levels at baseline, 4 weeks after the start of treatment, and 24 weeks after treatment in 159 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients who received DAA therapy. Other non-invasive fibrosis markers (aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio and FIB-4 index) were examined as well. Baseline median ATX levels were comparable between the 144 patients who achieved a SVR and the 15 who did not (1.54 vs. 1.62 mg/L), but median ATX levels became significantly decreased during and after DAA therapy in the SVR group only (from 1.54 to 1.40 and 1.31 mg/L, respectively; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). ATX was significantly decreased between baseline and 4 weeks of treatment in overall, male, and female SVR patients (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In subjects with low necroinflammatory activity in the liver (i.e., alanine aminotransferase &amp;lt; 30 U/L), ATX levels were significantly reduced from baseline to 4 weeks of treatment and remained low (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) in patients with a SVR. Thus, interferon-free DAA therapy was associated with a significant decrease in serum ATX levels in patients achieving a SVR, suggesting early regression of liver fibrosis in addition to inflammation treatment.</description><updated>1522875600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195632</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195632</canonicalUrl><title>Changes in serum levels of autotaxin with direct-acting antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C</title><published>1522875600000</published><fingerprint>d54f7625</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoo Yamazaki, Satoru Joshita, Takeji Umemura, Yoko Usami, Ayumi Sugiura, Naoyuki Fujimori, Takefumi Kimura, Akihiro Matsumoto, Koji Igarashi, Masao Ota, Eiji Tanaka&lt;/p&gt;

The main drawback limiting widespread applicability of parahydrogen-based techniques in biomedicine is the presence of organometallic compounds (the polarization transfer catalysts) in solution with hyperpolarized contrast agents. These catalysts are typically complexes of platinum-group metals and their administration in vivo should be avoided.
Herein, we show how extraction of a hyperpolarized compound from an organic phase to an aqueous phase combined with a rapid (less than 10 seconds) Ir-based catalyst capture by metal scavenging agents can produce pure parahydrogen-based hyperpolarized contrast agents as demonstrated by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The presented methodology enables fast and efficient means of producing pure hyperpolarized aqueous solutions for biomedical and other uses.</description><summary><content>Hyperpolarization techniques based on the use of parahydrogen provide orders of magnitude signal enhancement for magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging.

&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; is an important cause of infection and commonly colonizes the nasopharynx of young children, along with other potentially pathogenic bacteria. The objectives of this study were to estimate the carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Moraxella catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; in young children in Indonesia, and to examine interactions between these bacterial species. 302 healthy children aged 12–24 months were enrolled in community health centers in the Bandung, Central Lombok, and Padang regions. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and stored according to World Health Organization recommendations, and bacterial species detected by qPCR. Pneumococcal serotyping was conducted by microarray and latex agglutination/Quellung. Overall carriage prevalence was 49.5% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, 27.5% for &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, 42.7% for &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and 7.3% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To explore the relation between cigarette smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness at first diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients diagnosed with urinary bladder cancer (BC) between 1995–2011 under the age of 75 years were retrospectively identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and invited for a study on genetic and lifestyle risk factors for BC. Information on patients’ self-reported smoking history was retrieved by means of a postal questionnaire. Tumors were stratified regarding the risk of progression defined by tumor stage and grade. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the relation between smoking intensity and aggressiveness of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The UBC study population comprised 323 (17.4%) never smokers, 870 (46.8%) former cigarette smokers, and 630 (33.9%) current cigarette smokers. A higher smoking amount was a risk factor of getting high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) compared with low-risk NMIBC in ever and former cigarette smokers (OR: 1.02 per cigarette smoked, 95% CI: 1.00–1.03 and OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.05, respectively). A statistically significant dose-response increase in the risk of a more aggressive cancer type (high-risk NMIBC and MIBC) was observed with increasing smoking duration among former smokers (p for trend 0.035 and 0.008, respectively). No significant association of the evaluated smoking intensity variables was observed in current smokers. A longer time of smoking cessation correlated with a lower odds of a more aggressive cancer.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;We observed a weak increase in the risk of a more aggressive tumor type with increasing smoking intensity in former smokers, but this association was absent in current smokers.This conflicting result may suggest that there is no strong relation between smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness. Analyses of prospective studies with longitudinal smoking assessment may provide a more definitive answer to the research question.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1521838800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194039</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194039</canonicalUrl><title>Smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness at diagnosis</title><published>1521838800000</published><fingerprint>e7bd794</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by André L.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterised by pancreatic beta cell destruction and absolute insulin deficiency. The strongest predictor of diabetes complications is glycaemic control and achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0% is the primary management target. However, standard treatment appears to be lacking and adjunctive strategies require consideration. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effect of low-carbohydrate diets on type 1 diabetes management. Four databases were searched from inception until 28 March 2017: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; and EMBASE. All primary studies containing a methods section (excluding cross-sectional) were included. Reports had to quantitatively measure the effect(s) of a dietary intervention or observed intake over at least two weeks where carbohydrate is below 45% total energy in adults and/or children with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was HbA1c and secondary outcomes were severe hypoglycaemia, total daily insulin, BMI, quality of life and mean daily glucose. Seventy-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and nine were included (two randomised controlled trials, four pre-post interventions, two case-series, one case-report). Eight studies reported a mean change in HbA1c with a low-carbohydrate diet. Of these, four reported a non-significant change (P ≥ 0.05) and three reported statistically significant reductions (P &amp;lt; 0.05).

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterised by pancreatic beta cell destruction and absolute insulin deficiency. The strongest predictor of diabetes complications is glycaemic control and achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0% is the primary management target. However, standard treatment appears to be lacking and adjunctive strategies require consideration. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effect of low-carbohydrate diets on type 1 diabetes management. Four databases were searched from inception until 28 March 2017: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; and EMBASE. All primary studies containing a methods section (excluding cross-sectional) were included. Reports had to quantitatively measure the effect(s) of a dietary intervention or observed intake over at least two weeks where carbohydrate is below 45% total energy in adults and/or children with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was HbA1c and secondary outcomes were severe hypoglycaemia, total daily insulin, BMI, quality of life and mean daily glucose. Seventy-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and nine were included (two randomised controlled trials, four pre-post interventions, two case-series, one case-report). Eight studies reported a mean change in HbA1c with a low-carbohydrate diet. Of these, four reported a non-significant change (P ≥ 0.05) and three reported statistically significant reductions (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia, five reported total insulin, three reported BMI, and one reported blood glucose. Due to the significant heterogeneity of included studies, an overall effect could not be determined. This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Jessica L.

As the largest, and the first macrocyclic chromonic liquid crystals, macrocyclic iminium salts are easily accessible through a modular design and provide a means to rationally synthesize structures that mimic the morphology and rheology of carbon nanotubes and biological tubules.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>12</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/High_Aspect_Ratio_Nanotubes_Assembled_from_Macrocyclic_Iminium_Salts/6016355</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521809962068</crawled><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><title>High Aspect Ratio Nanotubes Assembled from Macrocyclic Iminium Salts</title><published>1521763200000</published><fingerprint>2f315d61</fingerprint><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/High_Aspect_Ratio_Nanotubes_Assembled_from_Macrocyclic_Iminium_Salts/6016355</link><author><name>NA</name></author></item><item><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1626dcdcf9e:6b9e6cb:34f43e70</id><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/434/eaan2306?rss=1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;The earliest autoantibodies in lupus are directed against the RNA binding autoantigen Ro60, but the triggers against this evolutionarily conserved antigen remain elusive.

The aim of this study was to characterize the urine metabolome of women with &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT) uro-genital infection (n = 21), comparing it with a group of CT-negative subjects (n = 98). By means of a proton-based nuclear magnetic resonance (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR) spectroscopy, we detected and quantified the urine metabolites of a cohort of 119 pre-menopausal Caucasian women, attending a STI Outpatients Clinic in Italy. In case of a CT positive result, CT molecular genotyping was performed by &lt;i&gt;omp1&lt;/i&gt; gene semi-nested PCR followed by RFLP analysis. We were able to identify several metabolites whose concentrations were significantly higher in the urine samples of CT-positive subjects, including sucrose, mannitol, pyruvate and lactate. In contrast, higher urinary levels of acetone represented the main feature of CT-negative women.
These results were not influenced by the age of patients nor by the CT serovars (D, E, F, G, K) responsible of the urethral infections. Since the presence of sugars can increase the stability of chlamydial proteins, higher levels of sucrose and mannitol in the urethral lumen, related to a higher sugar consumption, could have favoured CT infection acquisition or could have been of aid for the bacterial viability. Peculiar dietary habits of the subjects enrolled, in term of type and amount of food consumed, could probably explain these findings. Lactate and pyruvate could result from CT-induced immunopathology, as a product of the inflammatory microenvironment. Further studies are needed to understand the potential role of these metabolites in the pathogenesis of CT infection, as well as their diagnostic/prognostic use.</description><updated>1521752400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194827</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194827</canonicalUrl><title>Urine metabolome in women with &amp;lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&amp;lt;/i&gt; infection</title><published>1521752400000</published><fingerprint>1cb5d57a</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Claudio Foschi, Luca Laghi, Antonietta D’Antuono, Valeria Gaspari, Chenglin Zhu, Nicolò Dellarosa, Melissa Salvo, Antonella Marangoni&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent genetic cause of intellectual disability. Despite the fact that more than 50 years have passed since the discovery of its genetic aberrations, the exact pathogenesis of the DS phenotype has remained largely unexplained. It was recently hypothesized that the DS pathogenesis involves complex (epi)genetic, molecular and cellular determinants. To date, many reports have addressed epigenetic aberrations associated with DS at different developmental stages/ages and tissue types, but to our best knowledge not in DS newborns. This study aimed to investigate genome-wide methylation patterns in DS newborns compared to non-trisomic newborns.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;We analyzed blood samples obtained from ten newborns with DS and five age-matched non-trisomic newborns. Epigenetic profiles were obtained from extracted DNA using the Illumina Infinium 450K array. Since aberrant blood cell distribution is known to be present in DS, we applied two distinct models: with and without correction for estimated blood cell distribution.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Differentially methylated position (DMP) analysis of the uncorrected model detected 19525 significant hits (51,2% hypomethylated). In the corrected model, we found 121953 significant DMPs (49,8% hypomethylated). Independent of the used model we observed a chromosome 21 dosage effect. Moreover, we detected 46 and 145 differentially methylated regions in the uncorrected and corrected model respectively, both showing hypomethylation overrepresentation. Replication analyses of DMPs and DMRs found by Bacalini &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. (2015) showed a large overlap.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In this study, we found methylation profile differences between DS newborns and controls reflecting a systematically affected epigenetic profile. The observed chromosome 21 dosage effect suggests the involvement of affected essential regulatory factors/regions or altered expression of chromatin modeling enzymes located on chromosome 21. Additional research is necessary to substantiate these hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1522443600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194938</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194938</canonicalUrl><title>Widespread domain-like perturbations of DNA methylation in whole blood of Down syndrome neonates</title><published>1522443600000</published><fingerprint>8d6b0412</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Henneman, Arjan Bouman, Adri Mul, Lia Knegt, Anne-Marie van der Kevie-Kersemaekers, Nitash Zwaveling-Soonawala, Hanne E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of learning and memory impairments remains a challenge. Recent investigations have shown that the activation of group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) in cultured hippocampal neurons by application of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) causes the regulated internalization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which subsequently activates protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Through phosphorylating the C-terminals of the NMDAR GluN2 subunits, PKD1 down-regulates the activity of remaining (non-internalized) surface NMDARs. The knockdown of PKD1 does not affect the DHPG-induced inhibition of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) but prevents the DHPG-induced inhibition of NMDAR-mediated mEPSCs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, we investigated the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; effects of bilateral infusions of DHPG into the hippocampal CA1 area of rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object discrimination (NOD) tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 300 adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250–280 g) were used for behavioral tests. One hundred ninety four were used in MWM test and the other 106 rats in the NOD test.

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of learning and memory impairments remains a challenge. Recent investigations have shown that the activation of group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) in cultured hippocampal neurons by application of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) causes the regulated internalization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which subsequently activates protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Through phosphorylating the C-terminals of the NMDAR GluN2 subunits, PKD1 down-regulates the activity of remaining (non-internalized) surface NMDARs. The knockdown of PKD1 does not affect the DHPG-induced inhibition of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) but prevents the DHPG-induced inhibition of NMDAR-mediated mEPSCs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, we investigated the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; effects of bilateral infusions of DHPG into the hippocampal CA1 area of rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object discrimination (NOD) tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 300 adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250–280 g) were used for behavioral tests.

Many important applications continuously generate data, such as financial transaction administration, satellite monitoring, network flow monitoring, and web information processing. The data mining results are always evolving with the newly generated data. Obviously, for the clustering task, it is better to incrementally update the new clustering results based on the old data rather than to recluster all of the data from scratch. The incremental clustering approach is an essential way to solve the problem of clustering with growing Big Data. This paper proposes a boundary-profile-based incremental clustering (BPIC) method to find arbitrarily shaped clusters with dynamically growing datasets. This method represents the existing clustering results with a collection of boundary profiles and discards the inner points of clusters rather than keep all data. It greatly saves both time and space storage costs. To identify the boundary profile, this paper presents a boundary-vector-based boundary point detection (BV-BPD) algorithm that summarizes the structure of the existing clusters. The BPIC method processes each new point in an online fashion and updates the clustering results in a batch mode. When a new point arrives, the BPIC method either immediately labels it or temporarily puts it into a bucket according to the relationship between the new data and the boundary profiles. A bucket is employed to distinguish the noise from the potential seeds of new clusters and alleviate the effects of data order. When the bucket is full, the BPIC method will cluster the data within it and update the clustering results. Thus, the BPIC method is insensitive to noise and the order of new data, which is critical for the robustness of the incremental clustering process. In the experiments, the performance of the boundary point detection algorithm BV-BPD is compared with the state-of-the-art method. The results show that the BV-BPD is better than the state-of-the-art method. Additionally, the performance of BPIC and other two incremental clustering methods are investigated in terms of clustering quality, time and space efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the BPIC method is able to get a qualified clustering result on a large dataset with higher time and space efficiency.</description><updated>1524258000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196108</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196108</canonicalUrl><title>An incremental clustering method based on the boundary profile</title><published>1524258000000</published><fingerprint>53c7bd79</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Junpeng Bao, Wenqing Wang, Tianshe Yang, Guan Wu&lt;/p&gt;

In this study, individuals estimated interval times of several minutes (from 2 to 32 minutes) during their everyday lives using a cell phone they kept with them. Their emotional state, the difficulty of the activity performed during this interval, and the attention that it required were also assessed, together with their subjective experience of the passage of time. The results showed that the mean time estimates and their variability increased linearly with increasing interval duration, indicating that the fundamental scalar property of time found for short durations also applies to very long durations of several minutes. In addition, the emotional state and difficulty of the activity were significant predictors of the judgment of long durations. However, the awareness of the passage of time appeared to play a crucial role in the judgment of very long duration in humans. A theory on the emergence of the awareness of the passage of time and how it affects the judgment of interval durations lasting several minutes is therefore discussed.</description><updated>1522789200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195397</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195397</canonicalUrl><title>The explicit judgment of long durations of several minutes in everyday life: Conscious retrospective memory judgment and the role of affects?</title><published>1522789200000</published><fingerprint>a61dd276</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sylvie Droit-Volet, Sophie Monceau, Mickaël Berthon, Panos Trahanias, Michail Maniadakis&lt;/p&gt;

The cold-water coral &lt;i&gt;Lophelia pertusa&lt;/i&gt; is an ecosystem engineer that builds reef structures on the seafloor. The interaction of the reef topography with hydrodynamics is known to enhance the supply of suspended food sources to the reef communities. However, the reef framework is also a substrate for other organisms that may compete for the very same suspended food sources. Here, we used the passive suspension feeder &lt;i&gt;Lophelia pertusa&lt;/i&gt; and the active suspension feeding sponge &lt;i&gt;Hymedesmia coriacea&lt;/i&gt; as model organisms to study niche overlap using isotopically-enriched algae and bacteria as suspended food sources. The coral and the sponge were fed with a combination of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-enriched bacteria/&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-enriched algae or &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-enriched bacteria/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-enriched algae, which was subsequently traced into bulk tissue, coral skeleton and dissolved inorganic carbon (i.e. respiration). Both the coral and the sponge assimilated and respired the suspended bacteria and algae, indicating niche overlap between these species. The assimilation rates of C and N into bulk tissue of specimens incubated separately were not significantly different from assimilation rates during incubations with co-occurring corals and sponges. Hence, no evidence for exploitative resource competition was found, but this is likely due to the saturating experimental food concentration that was used. We do not rule out that exploitative competition occurs in nature during periods of low food concentrations. Food assimilation and respiration rates of the sponge were almost an order of magnitude higher than those of the cold-water coral. We hypothesize that the active suspension feeding mode of the sponge explains the observed differences in resource uptake as opposed to the passive suspension feeding mode of the cold-water coral. These feeding mode differences may set constraints on suitable habitats for cold-water corals and sponges in their natural habitats.</description><updated>1522098000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194659</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194659</canonicalUrl><title>Niche overlap between a cold-water coral and an associated sponge for isotopically-enriched particulate food sources</title><published>1522098000000</published><fingerprint>88bebd50</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dick van Oevelen, Christina E.

Presently, third generation sequencing platforms able to generate much longer reads are becoming more widespread. These platforms come with the significant drawback of higher sequencing error rates, which make them ill-suited to current genotyping algorithms. However, the longer reads make more of the genome unambiguously mappable and typically provide linkage information between neighboring variants. Results: In this paper we introduce a novel approach for haplotype-aware genotyping from noisy long reads. We do this by considering bipartitions of the sequencing reads, corresponding to the two haplotypes. We formalize the computational problem in terms of a Hidden Markov Model and compute posterior genotype probabilities using the forward-backward algorithm. Genotype predictions can then be made by picking the most likely genotype at each site. Our experiments indicate that longer reads allow significantly more of the genome to potentially be accurately genotyped. Further, we are able to independently validate with both Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences sequencing data millions of variants previously identified by short-read technologies in the reference NA12878 sample, including hundreds of thousands of variants that were not previously included in the high-confidence reference set.</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293944v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522776887867</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/03/293944</canonicalUrl><title>Haplotype-aware genotyping from noisy long reads [NEW RESULTS]</title><published>1522738800000</published><fingerprint>f6063ea8</fingerprint><content><content>Motivation: Current genotyping approaches for single nucleotide variations (SNVs) rely on short, relatively accurate reads from second generation sequencing devices.

The relationship between the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of neural systems is of central importance in brain network science. It is an open question, however, how the SC-FC relationship depends on specific topological features of brain networks or the models used for describing neural dynamics. Using a basic but general model of discrete excitable units that follow a susceptible—excited—refractory activity cycle (SER model), we here analyze how the network activity patterns underlying functional connectivity are shaped by the characteristic topological features of the network. We develop an analytical framework for describing the contribution of essential topological elements, such as common inputs and pacemakers, to the coactivation of nodes, and demonstrate the validity of the approach by comparison of the analytical predictions with numerical simulations of various exemplar networks. The present analytic framework may serve as an initial step for the mechanistic understanding of the contributions of brain network topology to brain dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-BJLyjXZ7qg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Arnaud Messé</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006084</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arnaud Messé, Marc-Thorsten Hütt, Claus C.

Tissue refractive index provides important information about morphology at the nanoscale. Since the malignant transformation involves both intra- and inter-cellular changes in the refractive index map, the tissue disorder measurement can be used to extract important diagnosis information. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) provides a practical means of extracting this information as it maps the optical path-length difference (OPD) across a tissue sample with sub-wavelength sensitivity.

Tissue refractive index provides important information about morphology at the nanoscale. Since the malignant transformation involves both intra- and inter-cellular changes in the refractive index map, the tissue disorder measurement can be used to extract important diagnosis information. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) provides a practical means of extracting this information as it maps the optical path-length difference (OPD) across a tissue sample with sub-wavelength sensitivity. In this work, we employ QPI to compare the tissue disorder strength between benign and malignant breast tissue histology samples. Our results show that disease progression is marked by a significant &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; in the disorder strength. Since our imaging system can be added as an upgrading module to an existing microscope, we anticipate that it can be integrated easily in the pathology work flow.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Masanori Takabayashi</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194320</link></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1627110dea7:71959d0:9f3b30f2</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03633-x</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RodZ modulates geometric localization of the bacterial actin MreB to regulate cell shape&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RodZ modulates geometric localization of the bacterial actin MreB to regulate cell shape, Published online: 29 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03633-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03633-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Membrane protein RodZ interacts with the actin-like protein MreB, which coordinates cell-wall insertion to maintain the typical rod-like shape of E. coli cells.

Gut bacterial communities have been shown to be influenced by diet, host phylogeny and anatomy, but most of these studies have been done in captive animals. Here we compare the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of wild birds. We characterized the gizzard and intestinal microbiota among 8 wild Neotropical bird species, granivorous or frugivorous species of the orders Columbiformes and Passeriformes. We sequenced the V4 region of the &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene in 94 collected samples from 32 wild birds from 5 localities, and compared bacterial communities by foraging guild, organ, locality and bird taxonomy. &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene-based sequencing data were examined using QIIME with linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) and metabolic pathways were predicted using PICRUSt algorism. We identified 8 bacterial phyla, dominated by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Beta diversity analyses indicated significant separation of gut communities by bird orders (Columbiformes vs. Passerifomes) and between bird species (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In lower intestine, PICRUSt shows a predominance of carbohydrate metabolism in granivorous birds and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways in frugivorous birds. Gizzard microbiota was significantly richer in granivorous, in relation to frugivorous birds (Chao 1; non-parametric t-test, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), suggesting a microbial gizzard function, beyond grinding food. The results suggest that the most important factor separating the bacterial community structure was bird taxonomy, followed by foraging guild. However, variation between localities is also likely to be important, but this could not been assessed with our study design.</description><updated>1522098000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>10</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194857</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194857</canonicalUrl><title>Comparison of gizzard and intestinal microbiota of wild neotropical birds</title><published>1522098000000</published><fingerprint>e8e282f4</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Circulating melatonin is a good candidate biomarker for studies of circadian rhythms and circadian disruption.

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Aspartame (L-aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester) is a non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) approved for use in more than 6000 dietary products and pharmaceuticals consumed by the general public including adults and children, pregnant and nursing mothers. However a recent prospective study reported a doubling of the risk of being overweight amongst 1-year old children whose mothers consumed NNS-sweetened beverages daily during pregnancy. We have previously shown that chronic aspartame (ASP) exposure commencing &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; may detrimentally affect adulthood adiposity status, glucose metabolism and aspects of behavior and spatial cognition, and that this can be modulated by developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade with the competitive antagonist CGP 39551 (CGP). Since glucose homeostasis and certain aspects of behavior and locomotion are regulated in part by the NMDAR-rich hypothalamus, which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal- (HPA) axis, we have elected to examine changes in hypothalamic and adrenal gene expression in response to ASP exposure in the presence or absence of developmental NMDAR antagonism with CGP, using Affymetrix microarray analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using 2-factor ANOVA we identified 189 ASP-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the adult male hypothalamus and 2188 in the adrenals, and a further 23 hypothalamic and 232 adrenal genes significantly regulated by developmental treatment with CGP alone. ASP exposure robustly elevated the expression of a network of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis, together with cell stress and inflammatory genes, consistent with previous reports of aspartame-induced CNS stress and oxidative damage. These genes were not differentially expressed in ASP mice with CGP antagonism.

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Aspartame (L-aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester) is a non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) approved for use in more than 6000 dietary products and pharmaceuticals consumed by the general public including adults and children, pregnant and nursing mothers. However a recent prospective study reported a doubling of the risk of being overweight amongst 1-year old children whose mothers consumed NNS-sweetened beverages daily during pregnancy. We have previously shown that chronic aspartame (ASP) exposure commencing &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; may detrimentally affect adulthood adiposity status, glucose metabolism and aspects of behavior and spatial cognition, and that this can be modulated by developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade with the competitive antagonist CGP 39551 (CGP). Since glucose homeostasis and certain aspects of behavior and locomotion are regulated in part by the NMDAR-rich hypothalamus, which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal- (HPA) axis, we have elected to examine changes in hypothalamic and adrenal gene expression in response to ASP exposure in the presence or absence of developmental NMDAR antagonism with CGP, using Affymetrix microarray analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using 2-factor ANOVA we identified 189 ASP-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the adult male hypothalamus and 2188 in the adrenals, and a further 23 hypothalamic and 232 adrenal genes significantly regulated by developmental treatment with CGP alone. ASP exposure robustly elevated the expression of a network of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis, together with cell stress and inflammatory genes, consistent with previous reports of aspartame-induced CNS stress and oxidative damage. These genes were not differentially expressed in ASP mice with CGP antagonism. In the adrenal glands of ASP-exposed mice, GABA and Glutamate receptor subunit genes were amongst those most highly upregulated. Developmental NMDAR antagonism alone had less effect on adulthood gene expression and affected mainly hypothalamic neurogenesis and adrenal steroid metabolism. Combined ASP + CGP treatment mainly upregulated genes involved in adrenal drug and cholesterol metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ASP exposure increased the expression of functional networks of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis and adrenal catecholamine synthesis, patterns of expression which were not present in ASP-exposed mice with developmental NMDAR antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Kate S.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) emphasises the role of biodiversity in delivering benefits essential for all people and, as a result, seeks to safeguard all life-forms. The indices that are used to measure progress towards international conservation and sustainability goals, however, focus solely on the ‘native’ component of biodiversity. A subset of non-native species can cause undesirable economic, social, or biological effects. But non-native species also contribute to regional biodiversity (species richness and biotic interactions) and ecosystem services. In some regions and cities, non-native species make up more than half of all species. Currently, the contributions of these species to biodiversity and ecosystem services are overlooked. Here, I argue that biodiversity and sustainability indices should include all species. This is not only consistent with definitions of biodiversity but also will promote the idea that long-term, sustainable, human well-being is intricately tied to benefits derived from nature.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/-8DNjfEBZcQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005568</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/-8DNjfEBZcQ/article</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523987865079</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Do non-native species contribute to biodiversity?</title><published>1523998800000</published><fingerprint>28438fed</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Martin A.

Ultra-precision face turning of Al6061 mirrors using single point diamond turning (SPDT) was undertaken to investigate the correlation between the surface roughness and reflectance. By reducing the feed rate, the optimal feed rate when the chip formation became unstable was studied. Most importantly, the impact on the roughness and reflectance was examined when the chip formation ceased to be continuous. It was determined that for a feed rate below 3 mm/min, the surface roughness always improved as the feed rate decreased, at the cost of a reduction of the normalized reflectance. The reduction of reflectance was determined to be the result of the lower material removal rates that led to a discontinuous chip formation.</description><updated>1522702800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195083</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195083</canonicalUrl><title>Al6061 surface roughness and optical reflectance when machined by single point diamond turning at a low feed rate</title><published>1522702800000</published><fingerprint>3d5da0e0</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by L.

The mutations destabilize particles and cause conformational bistability of J, which yields progeny of multiple phenotypic forms, each proficient at different receptors.

I remember coming across this one some years ago being surprised – I’d never heard that one myself, but it was apparently a pretty widespread fear. You could imagine a situation where tumor cells are mechanically detached and could spread, but that’s actually less likely than it might seem, since not all of these cells can actually attach somewhere else and start growing again (although there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicular-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html&quot;&gt;special situations&lt;/a&gt; where such disturbance, even to the level of taking a biopsy sample, is known to be risky).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t know enough about, though, is an effect seen in breast cancer treatment. After surgery, the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer peaks about 12 to 18 months later. It’s not a sure thing, fortunately, but it’s definitely a real effect, and one that would certainly lead to people thinking that the surgery had (somehow) spread the cancer around. That’s actually a pretty reasonable hypothesis, given the observations, so that particular “common myth” has something behind it. But how? The same effect is noted in patients who have undergone complete mastectomy, which doesn’t disturb the tumor tissue itself much (or at all). Alternatively, were these actively growing tumors that had spread before the surgery and were just too small to detect? Some have argued for this explanation, and it’s hard to disprove. There’s yet another plausible mechanism: these tumor cells might have had already spread before the surgery, but were somehow not growing, and something happened to change that. What is it about surgery that would allow them to start growing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/436/eaan3464&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has what may well be the answer. Studying the effects of surgery in mouse models of metastatic cancer, it appears that the post-surgical wound healing response is the culprit. There appears to be an ongoing T-cell response that is holding down these potential metastatic tumors, but it’s disrupted by the inflammation response after surgery. Expressing GFP in murine mammary tumors and then injecting these into other (syngenic) mice caused a T-cell response to the GFP itself, and ultimately the tumors were rejected by the immune system. But surgically wounding these mice triggered an outgrowth of the tumors instead, probably through the actions of inflammatory monocytes (which differentiate into macrophages inside the tumor tissue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s even more interesting is that these effects can be abrogated &lt;em&gt;simply by treating the mice with NSAIDs to damp down the inflammation response&lt;/em&gt;. To avoid interactions between the tumor cells and the anti-inflammatory drugs, the procedure was to do the surgical wounding (with and without NSAID treatment with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meloxicam&quot;&gt;meloxicam&lt;/a&gt;) several days before the tumor cells were even injected, with time enough to clear the system out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notably, treatment with meloxicam did not appear to impede wound healing in these mice. Seven days after surgical wounding (4 days after the cessation of either meloxicam or saline treatment), D2A1-GFP cells were orthotopically injected contralateral to the wound site. Meloxicam treatment had no effect on tumor growth in the absence of surgical wounding (Fig. 4G, left). In contrast, in wounded groups, tumors in meloxicam-treated mice were significantly smaller than tumors in wounded mice treated with saline (P &amp;lt; 0.05; Fig. 4G, right). Surprisingly, tumors in wounded, meloxicam-treated mice were even smaller than tumors in unwounded, untreated mice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there had been a retrospective study of breast cancer patients that suggested that treatment with NSAIDs seemed to reduce the metastatic events, but no one was sure if that was a direct mechanistic effect on pre-existing tumors, or on their possible activation. These results, though, suggest that it really is an activation mechanism, and that patients should be treated with NSAIDs in just this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We undertook to model a clinical phenomenon that occurs at low frequency and arises only with delayed kinetics in patients. We therefore used hundreds of mice to ensure that we had sufficient statistical power to draw firm conclusions. In considering these conclusions, we do not wish to suggest that tumor resection surgery be avoided because of the potentially negative side effects suggested previously by clinical data and demonstrated here experimentally. Instead, we argue that coupling surgery with short-term anti-inflammatory treatments may substantially improve patient outcomes by mitigating the systemic consequences of surgical breast cancer resection. Of critical importance, perioperative treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam potently inhibited the impact of wounding on tumor growth. Furthermore, our study suggests that the treatment of breast cancer patients with anti-inflammatory agents during and after surgical resection of primary tumors may yield substantial benefits by reducing the incidence of early metastatic relapse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no reason for this not to immediately move into clinical practice, and I hope that this paper gets widely noticed. NSAID therapy is cheap and well-tolerated, and the risk/benefit ratio would seem to be about as good as it can get. So in general, untangling the relationships of the immune system with cancer is continuing to provide results – both in turning the immune response up and (in this case) turning it down. That process is most definitely going to continue. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In human sleep studies, the probability of discomfort from the electrodes and the change in environment usually results in first-night recordings being discarded. Sleep recordings from the first night in human subjects often differ in amount of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and the overall sleep architecture. This study investigated whether recordings of sleep states in dairy cows also show a first-night effect. Non-invasive electrophysiological recordings were carried out on nine cows of the Swedish Red breed during three consecutive 24-hour periods (recording days 1–3). Overall, cows spent 12.9 ± 1.4 hours awake, 8.2 ± 1 hours ruminating, 57.2 ± 20.3 min drowsing, 44.1 ± 20.2 min in REM sleep and 64.3 ± 38.1 min in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (mean ± SD) and there were no significant differences between recording days in total duration for any of the sleep and awake states. However, the bouts of REM sleep and rumination were longer, and the awake bouts were shorter, at night time compared to daytime, regardless of recording day. The awake bouts also showed an interaction effect with longer bouts at daytime during day 1 compared to daytime on day 3. Data on sleep and awake states recorded in adult dairy cows during three consecutive 24-h periods showed great variation in sleep time between cows, but total time for each state was not significantly affected by recording day. Further and more detailed studies of how sleep architecture is affected by recording day is necessary to fully comprehend the first-night effect in dairy cows.</description><updated>1523653200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195593</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><title>First-night effect on sleep time in dairy cows</title><published>1523653200000</published><fingerprint>47c60dcc</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Ternman, Matti Pastell, Laura Hänninen, Sigrid Agenäs, Per P.

Diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon, &lt;i&gt;Salmo salar&lt;/i&gt; were fed high-protein, phosphorus-rich diets (56–60% protein; ca 18g phosphorus kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; diet) whilst being reared at low temperature from start-feeding until parr-smolt transformation. Performances of salmon fed diets based on fish meal (STD) or a mix of fishmeal and hydrolysed fish proteins (HFM) as the major protein sources were compared in terms of mortality, diet digestibility, growth and skeletal deformities. Separate groups of diploids and triploids were reared in triplicate tanks (initially 3000 fish per tank; tank biomass ca. 620 g) from 0–2745 degree-days post-start feeding (ddPSF). Growth metrics (weight, length, condition factor) were recorded at ca. 4 week intervals, external signs of deformities to the operculum, jaws and spinal column were examined in parr sampled at 1390 ddPSF, and external signs of deformity and vertebral anomalies (by radiography) were examined in fish sampled at the end of the trial (2745 ddPSF). The triploid salmon generally had a lower mass per unit length, i.e. lower condition factor, throughout the trial, but this did not seem to reflect any consistent dietary or ploidy effects on either dietary digestibility or the growth of the fish. By the end of the trial fish in all treatment groups had achieved a weight of 50+ g, and had completed the parr-smolt transformation. The triploids had slightly, but significantly, fewer vertebrae (Triploids STD 58.74 ± 0.10; HFM 58.68 ± 0.05) than the diploids (Diploids STD 58.97 ± 0.14; HFM 58.89 ± 0.01), and the incidence of skeletal (vertebral) abnormalities was higher in triploids (Triploids STD 31 ± 0.90%; HFM 15 ± 1.44%) than in diploids (Diploids STD 4 ± 0.80%; HFM 4 ± 0.83%). The HFM diet gave a significant reduction in the numbers of triploid salmon with vertebral anomalies in comparison with the triploids fed the STD diet possibly as a result of differences in phosphorus bioavailability between the two diets. Overall, the incidence of skeletal deformities was lower than reported in previous studies (Diploids 20+%, Triploids 40+%), possibly as a result of the combination of rearing at low-temperature and phosphorus-rich diets being used in the present study.</description><updated>1521752400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194340</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194340</canonicalUrl><title>Growth and development of skeletal anomalies in diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon (&amp;lt;i&gt;Salmo salar&amp;lt;/i&gt;) fed phosphorus-rich diets with fish meal and hydrolyzed fish protein</title><published>1521752400000</published><fingerprint>e03b8fb2</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefano Peruzzi, Velmurugu Puvanendran, Guido Riesen, Rudi Ripman Seim, Ørjan Hagen, Silvia Martínez-Llorens, Inger-Britt Falk-Petersen, Jorge M.

The triploids had slightly, but significantly, fewer vertebrae (Triploids STD 58.74 ± 0.10; HFM 58.68 ± 0.05) than the diploids (Diploids STD 58.97 ± 0.14; HFM 58.89 ± 0.01), and the incidence of skeletal (vertebral) abnormalities was higher in triploids (Triploids STD 31 ± 0.90%; HFM 15 ± 1.44%) than in diploids (Diploids STD 4 ± 0.80%; HFM 4 ± 0.83%). The HFM diet gave a significant reduction in the numbers of triploid salmon with vertebral anomalies in comparison with the triploids fed the STD diet possibly as a result of differences in phosphorus bioavailability between the two diets. Overall, the incidence of skeletal deformities was lower than reported in previous studies (Diploids 20+%, Triploids 40+%), possibly as a result of the combination of rearing at low-temperature and phosphorus-rich diets being used in the present study.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Stefano Peruzzi</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194340</link></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162b12a08af:1e3ad:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3599.short?rss=1</originId><description>BIOPHYSICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY Correction for “Structural basis and energy landscape for the Ca2+ gating and calmodulation of the Kv7.2 K+ channel,” by Ganeko Bernardo-Seisdedos, Eider Nuñez, Carolina Gomis, Covadonga Malo, Álvaro Villarroel, and Oscar Millet, which was first published February 20, 2018; 10.1073/pnas.1800235115 (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 115:2395–2400)....</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3599.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523390744751</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3599</canonicalUrl><title>Correction for Bernardo-Seisdedos et al., Structural basis and energy landscape for the Ca2+ gating and calmodulation of the Kv7.2 K+ channel [Correction]</title><published>1523386901000</published><fingerprint>32a13cf1</fingerprint><content><content>BIOPHYSICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY Correction for “Structural basis and energy landscape for the Ca2+ gating and calmodulation of the Kv7.2 K+ channel,” by Ganeko Bernardo-Seisdedos, Eider Nuñez, Carolina Gomis, Covadonga Malo, Álvaro Villarroel, and Oscar Millet, which was first published February 20, 2018; 10.1073/pnas.1800235115 (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 115:2395–2400)....</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>NA</name></author><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3599.short?rss=1</link><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/15.cover-source.jpg?itok=EV6OyZPq</url><height>480</height><width>359</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6f7:34f43e70</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2725.short?rss=1</originId><description>The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is a laminated brain region in which neurogenesis begins during early embryonic development and continues until adulthood.

Currently, information on nearshore reef-associated fisheries is frequently disparate or incomplete, creating a challenge for effective management. This study utilized an existing non-commercial fishery dataset from Hawaiʻi, covering the period 2004–13, to estimate a variety of fundamental fishery parameters, including participation, effort, gear use, and catch per unit effort. We then used those data to reconstruct total catches per island. Non-commercial fisheries in this case comprise recreational, subsistence, and cultural harvest, which may be exchanged, but are not sold.

Currently, information on nearshore reef-associated fisheries is frequently disparate or incomplete, creating a challenge for effective management. This study utilized an existing non-commercial fishery dataset from Hawaiʻi, covering the period 2004–13, to estimate a variety of fundamental fishery parameters, including participation, effort, gear use, and catch per unit effort. We then used those data to reconstruct total catches per island. Non-commercial fisheries in this case comprise recreational, subsistence, and cultural harvest, which may be exchanged, but are not sold. By combining those data with reported commercial catch data, we estimated annual catch of nearshore reef-associated fisheries in the main Hawaiian Islands over the study period to be 1,167,758 ± 43,059 kg year&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (mean ± standard error). Average annual commercial reef fish catch over the same time period—184,911 kg year&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—was 16% of the total catch, but that proportion varied greatly among islands, ranging from 23% on Oʻahu to 5% on Molokaʻi. These results emphasize the importance of reef fishing in Hawaiʻi for reasons beyond commerce, such as food security and cultural practice, and highlight the large differences in fishing practices across the Hawaiian Islands.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Kaylyn S.

Prefrontal anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed as a potential approach to improve inhibitory control performance. The functional consequences of tDCS during inhibition tasks remain, however, largely unresolved. We addressed this question by analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recorded while participants completed a Go/NoGo task after right-lateralized prefrontal anodal tDCS with a crossover, sham-controlled, double-blind experimental design. We replicated previous evidence for an absence of offline effect of anodal stimulation on Go/NoGo performance. The fMRI results revealed a larger increase in right ventrolateral prefrontal activity for Go than NoGo trials in the anodal than sham condition. This pattern suggests that tDCS-induced increases in cortical excitability have larger effects on fMRI activity in regions with a lower task-related engagement. This was the case for the right prefrontal cortex in the Go condition in our task because while reactive inhibition was not engaged during execution trials, the unpredictability of the demand for inhibitory control still incited an engagement of proactive inhibition. Exploratory analyses further revealed that right prefrontal stimulation interacted with task-related functional demands in the supplementary motor area and the thalamus. Our collective results emphasize the dependency of offline tDCS functional effects on the task-related engagement of the stimulated areas and suggest that this factor might partly account for the discrepancies in the functional effects of tDCS observed in previous studies.</description><updated>1522270800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194936</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194936</canonicalUrl><title>Modulation of inhibitory control by prefrontal anodal tDCS: A crossover double-blind sham-controlled fMRI study</title><published>1522270800000</published><fingerprint>938d6bdc</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Etienne Sallard, Michael Mouthon, Michael De Pretto, Lucas Spierer&lt;/p&gt;

One common challenge in studying biological networks is the need to extract meaningful, small subgraphs out of large databases of potential interactions. A useful abstraction for this task turned out to be the Steiner network problems: given a reference &apos;&apos;database&apos;&apos; graph, find a parsimonious subgraph that satisfies a given set of connectivity demands. While this formulation proved useful in a number of instances, the next challenge is to account for the fact that the reference graph may not be static. This can happen for instance, when studying protein measurements in single cells or at different time points, whereby different subsets of conditions can have different protein milieu. We introduce the condition Steiner network problem in which we concomitantly consider a set of distinct biological conditions. Each condition is associated with a set of connectivity demands, as well as a set of edges that are assumed to be present in that condition. The goal of this problem is to find a minimal subgraph that satisfies all the demands through paths that are present in the respective condition. We show that introducing multiple conditions as an additional factor makes this problem much harder to approximate. Specifically, we prove that for C conditions, this new problem is NP-hard to approximate to a factor of C - epsilon, for every C greater than or equal to 2 and epsilon &gt; 0, and that this bound is tight. Moving beyond the worst case, we explore a special set of instances where the reference graph grows monotonically between conditions, and show that this problem admits substantially improved approximation algorithms. We also developed an integer linear programming solver for the general problem and demonstrate its ability to reach optimality with instances from the human protein interaction network. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to most connectivity problems studied in computational biology, accounting for multiplicity of biological conditions adds considerable complexity, which we propose to address with a new solver. Importantly, our results extend to several network connectivity problems that are commonly used in computational biology, such as Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree, and provide insight into the theoretical guarantees for their applications in a multiple condition setting.</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300012v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523652840370</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/13/300012</canonicalUrl><title>Connectivity Problems on Heterogeneous Graphs [NEW RESULTS]</title><published>1523602800000</published><fingerprint>5b260ad0</fingerprint><content><content>Network connectivity problems are abundant in computational biology research, where graphs are used to represent a range of phenomena: from physical interactions between molecules to more abstract relationships such as gene co-expression.

Background &lt;p&gt;Data are lacking on the risk and impact of a serious hemorrhage on the prognosis after ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). We aimed to estimate the incidence of serious hemorrhage, analyze the impact on mortality, and identify predictors of hemorrhage after discharge from IS or TIA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;All patients admitted to Östersund Hospital for an IS or TIA in 2010–2013 were included (n = 1528, mean age: 75.1 years). Serious hemorrhages were identified until 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; December 2015. Incidence rates were calculated. The impact on mortality (stratified by functional level) was determined with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Non-parametric estimation under the assumption of competing risk was performed to assess the cumulative incidence and predictors of serious hemorrhages.The incidence rates of serious (n = 113) and intracranial hemorrhages (n = 45) after discharge from IS and TIA were 2.48% and 0.96% per year at risk, respectively. Patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 3–5 exhibited 58.9% mortality during follow-up and those with mRS scores of 0–2 exhibited 18.4% mortality. A serious hemorrhage did not affect mortality in patients with impaired functional status, but it increased the risk of death in patients with mRS scores of 0–2. Hypertension was associated with increased risk of serious hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found that, after discharge from an IS or TIA, serious hemorrhages were fairly common. Impairments in function were associated with high mortality, but serious hemorrhages only increased the risk of mortality in patients with no or slight disability. Improved hypertension treatment may decrease the risk of serious hemorrhage, but in patients with low functional status, poor survival makes secondary prevention challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1522962000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195324</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195324</canonicalUrl><title>Serious hemorrhages after ischemic stroke or TIA – Incidence, mortality, and predictors</title><published>1522962000000</published><fingerprint>fc4e7cf8</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joachim Ögren, Anna-Lotta Irewall, Lars Söderström, Thomas Mooe&lt;/p&gt;

The source code of the program can be found at https://github.com/supramolecular-toolkit/stk.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/STK_A_Python_Toolkit_for_Supramolecular_Assembly/6127826</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523542114066</crawled><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><title>STK: A Python Toolkit for Supramolecular Assembly</title><published>1523491200000</published><fingerprint>8390af2</fingerprint><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/STK_A_Python_Toolkit_for_Supramolecular_Assembly/6127826</link><author><name>NA</name></author></item><item><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626525fb0b:6cdeb:76251cdd</id><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25201?af=R</originId><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25201?af=R</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522115410699</crawled><published>1522115410699</published><fingerprint>16f77d8d</fingerprint><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>NA</name></author><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25201?af=R</link></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca425d:9f3b30f2</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195246</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eugene V.

Viruses in avian hosts can pose threats to avian health and some have zoonotic potential. Hospitals that provide veterinary care for avian patients may serve as a site of exposure of other birds and human staff in the facility to these viruses. They can also provide a useful location to collect samples from avian patients in order to examine the viruses present in wild birds. This study aimed to investigate viruses of biosecurity and/or zoonotic significance in Australian birds by screening samples collected from 409 birds presented to the Australian Wildlife Health Centre at Zoos Victoria’s Healesville Sanctuary for veterinary care between December 2014 and December 2015. Samples were tested for avian influenza viruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, using genus- or family-wide polymerase chain reaction methods coupled with sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for detection and identification of both known and novel viruses. A very low prevalence of viruses was detected. &lt;i&gt;Columbid alphaherpesvirus 1&lt;/i&gt; was detected from a powerful owl (&lt;i&gt;Ninox strenua&lt;/i&gt;) with inclusion body hepatitis, and an avian paramyxovirus most similar to &lt;i&gt;Avian avulavirus 5&lt;/i&gt; was detected from a musk lorikeet (&lt;i&gt;Glossopsitta concinna&lt;/i&gt;). Two distinct novel avian alphaherpesviruses were detected in samples from a sulphur-crested cockatoo (&lt;i&gt;Cacatua galerita&lt;/i&gt;) and a tawny frogmouth (&lt;i&gt;Podargus strigoides&lt;/i&gt;). Avian influenza viruses and avian coronaviruses were not detected. The clinical significance of the newly detected viruses remains undetermined. Further studies are needed to assess the host specificity, epidemiology, pathogenicity and host-pathogen relationships of these novel viruses. Further genome characterization is also indicated, and would be required before these viruses can be formally classified taxonomically. The detection of these viruses contributes to our knowledge on avian virodiversity. The low level of avian virus detection, and the absence of any viruses with zoonotic potential, suggests low risk to biosecurity and human health.</description><updated>1521838800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194457</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194457</canonicalUrl><title>Avian viral surveillance in Victoria, Australia, and detection of two novel avian herpesviruses</title><published>1521838800000</published><fingerprint>88d52e54</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jemima Amery-Gale, Carol A.

&lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; formation of epithelial cell-cell contacts relies on actin-based protrusions as well as tightly controlled turnover of junctional actin once cells encounter each other and adhesion complexes assemble. The specific contributions of individual actin regulators on either protrusion formation or junctional actin turnover remain largely unexplored. Based on our previous findings of Formin-like 2 (FMNL2)-mediated control of junctional actin dynamics, we investigated its potential role in membrane protrusions and impact on newly forming epithelial contacts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of FMNL2 in human MCF10A cells combined with optogenetic control of Rac1 activity confirmed its critical function in the establishment of intercellular contacts. While lamellipodial protrusion rates remained unaffected, FMNL2 knockout cells were characterized by impaired filopodia formation similar to depletion of the Rho GTPase Cdc42. Silencing of Cdc42, however, failed to affect FMNL2-mediated contact formation. Hence, we propose a cell-cell contact-specific and Rac1-mediated function of FMNL2 entirely independent of Cdc42. Consistent with this, direct visualizations of native epithelial junction formation revealed a striking and specifically Rac1- and not Cdc42-dependent recruitment of FMNL2 to newly forming junctions as well as established cell-cell contacts within epithelial sheets.</description><updated>1522098000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</canonicalUrl><title>A Rac1-FMNL2 signaling module affects cell-cell contact formation independent of Cdc42 and membrane protrusions</title><published>1522098000000</published><fingerprint>f712f6c3</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Grobe, Andrea Wüstenhagen, Christian Baarlink, Robert Grosse, Katharina Grikscheit&lt;/p&gt;

The precise sizing of the stent graft in thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) affects aortic remodeling and hence, further outcome. Covering the proximal entry tear is essential for successful treatment of Type B aortic dissection. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) enables real-time aortic diameter assessment, and is especially useful when computed tomography (CT) image quality is poor. IVUS, however, is not routinely utilized due to cost inefficiency. We investigated the impact of IVUS-assisted stent graft sizing on aortic remodeling in TEVAR. In this single-center retrospective study we evaluated patients with Type B aortic dissection undergoing both CT and IVUS before TEVAR. We assessed the aortic diameter at the level of the left subclavian artery via both methods before stent implantation and analyzed due to which method the implanted stent graft was chosen, retrospectively. To determine the degrees of aortic remodeling involved, we evaluated true lumen and false lumen diameters, and total aortic remodeling in CT. We analyzed 45 patients with Type B aortic dissection undergoing TEVAR. The mean ages were 66.9±10.0 years fo0072 IVUS (n = 20) and 62.3±14.2 years for CT-assisted TEVAR (n = 25; p = 0.226). The follow-up time for both groups did not differ between the two groups (IVUS: 22.9±23.1 months, CT: 25.6±23.0 months; p = 0.700). While both methods were associated with advantages regarding aortic remodeling, IVUS-assisted sizing yielded a greater increase in true lumen (30.4±6.2 vs. 25.6±5.3; p = 0.008) and reductions in false lumen (14.4±8.5 vs. 23.9±9.3; p = 0.001) and total aortic diameter (35.5±6.0 vs. 39.9±8.1; p = 0.045). IVUS-guided stent graft sizing in Type B aortic dissection shows beneficial effects on aortic remodeling and might be of additional advantage in aortic diseases, especially when CT image quality is poor.</description><updated>1524171600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196180</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524160641534</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196180</canonicalUrl><title>Intravascular ultrasound assisted sizing in thoracic endovascular aortic repair improves aortic remodeling in Type B aortic dissection</title><published>1524171600000</published><fingerprint>e1e335e7</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Julia Lortz, Konstantinos Tsagakis, Christos Rammos, Michael Horacek, Thomas Schlosser, Heinz Jakob, Tienush Rassaf, Rolf Alexander Jánosi&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Although severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis-related diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD), there is no reliable biomarker of CAD risks in patients with OSA. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1-Abs) are associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-two adults diagnosed with OSA by polysomnography, 96 patients with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 64 healthy volunteers (HVs) were consecutively enrolled. Serum samples were collected from patients with OSA at diagnostic polysomnography and from patients with ACS at disease onset. Serum NBL1-Ab level was measured by amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay and its association with clinical variables related to atherosclerosis was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;NBL1-Ab level was significantly elevated in patients with both OSA and ACS compared with HVs. Subgroup analyses showed that NBL1-Ab level was markedly higher in patients with severe OSA and OSA patients with a history of CAD. Weak associations were observed between NBL1-Ab level and apnea-hypopnea index, age, mean SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and arousal index, whereas significantly higher NBL1-Ab levels were observed in OSA patients with a history of CAD than in those without a history of CAD. Sensitivity analysis using a logistic regression model also demonstrated that increased NBL1-Ab levels were associated with the previous history of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Elevated NBL1-Ab levels may be associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA, which needs to be confirmed further.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1522357200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195015</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195015</canonicalUrl><title>Circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1): A potential biomarker for coronary artery disease in patients with obstructive sleep apnea</title><published>1522357200000</published><fingerprint>b0341bac</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takuma Matsumura, Jiro Terada, Taku Kinoshita, Yoriko Sakurai, Misuzu Yahaba, Kenji Tsushima, Seiichiro Sakao, Kengo Nagashima, Toshinori Ozaki, Yoshio Kobayashi, Takaki Hiwasa, Koichiro Tatsumi&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Variations in the degree of hirsutism among women of different ethnic backgrounds may stem from multiple etiologies. Shorter length of the polymorphic CAG repeats of the &lt;i&gt;androgen receptor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt;) gene may be associated with increased activity of the receptor leading to hirsutism. We hypothesized that there are ethnic differences in the degree of hirsutism that is unrelated to androgen levels among Israeli women, and that the CAG repeats length may contribute to these differences. Anti-androgenic therapies, such as spironolactone, could be suggested if a shorter CAG repeats length is found to affect the difference in the degree of hirsutism between the ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Healthy Israeli Jewish women aged 18–45 years of Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi origin were invited to participate. Hirsutism was assessed using the simplified Ferriman–Gallwey (sFG) score, and serum total testosterone levels were measured as well. The CAG repeats length was determined by PCR. Methylation-sensitive methods were used to detect the fractional activity of each allele, and the weighted mean was calculated for the CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and eight women were recruited (49 Ashkenazi and 59 non-Ashkenazi). The Ashkenazi women had a significantly lower degree of hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), lower mean BMI (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), total testosterone levels (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017), and longer weighted bi-allelic CAG repeats mean (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015) compared to non-Ashkenazi women. For the group as a whole, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of CAG repeats in the &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; gene and the sFG score, while the number of repeats was not related to testosterone levels. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that ethnic origin and the CAG repeats length were the strongest factors affecting hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is a significant difference in the degree of hirsutism between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi women in Israel that is partially explained by CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1522184400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195046</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195046</canonicalUrl><title>The effect of CAG repeats length on differences in hirsutism among healthy Israeli women of different ethnicities</title><published>1522184400000</published><fingerprint>17eb6b10</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naomi Weintrob, Ori Eyal, Meital Slakman, Anat Segev Becker, Galit Israeli, Ofra Kalter-Leibovici, Shay Ben-Shachar&lt;/p&gt;

Although personality traits can largely affect individual fitness we know little about the evolutionary forces generating and maintaining personality variation. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that personality variation in aggression is sexually selected in the monogamous, bi-parental cichlid &lt;i&gt;Pelvicachromis pulcher&lt;/i&gt;. In this species, breeding pairs form territories and they aggressively defend their territory and offspring against con- and heterospecific intruders. In our mate choice study, we followed up two alternative hypotheses. We either expected females to show a directional preference for a high level and high consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for male parental quality). Alternatively, we expected females to choose males for (dis-)similarity in the level/consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for compatibility). Individual level and consistency of aggression were assessed for males and females using mirror tests. After eavesdropping on aggressive behaviour of two males (differing in level and consistency of aggression) females were then allowed to choose between the two males. Males, but not females, showed personality variation in aggression. Further, females generally preferred consistent over inconsistent males independent of their level of aggression. We did not detect a general preference for the level of male aggression. However, we found an above average preference for consistent high-aggression males; whereas female preference for inconsistent high-aggression did not deviate from random choice. Our results suggest behavioural consistency of aggression in male rainbow kribs is selected for via female mate choice. Further, our study underlines the importance of considering both the level and the consistency of a behavioural trait in studies of animal behaviour.</description><updated>1523394000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195766</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195766</canonicalUrl><title>Predictability is attractive: Female preference for behaviourally consistent males but no preference for the level of male aggression in a bi-parental cichlid</title><published>1523394000000</published><fingerprint>9fb58851</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ulrike Scherer, Mira Kuhnhardt, Wiebke Schuett&lt;/p&gt;

Amnion is a membrane surrounding the embryo/fetus which determine growth factors and interleukins with angiogenic, immunogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of conditioned culture medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion (hAM CCM) on migration and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial primary cells (HUVECs), freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs), and Jurkat leukemia cell line. Amnion membrane was freshly isolated from healthy placenta and its fragments cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to produce hAM CCM. Members of the IGFBP protein family made up one third of all assayed proteins present in the hAM medium. The hAM CCM did not affect the proliferation rate of HUVECs or MNCs, but we observed more intensive migration of those cells, and lower expression of CD31 surface antigen on HUVECs as compared to control cultures. In contrast, Jurkat cells did not respond to hAM CCM treatment by proliferation or mobility change. The conditioned medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion is easy to obtain and is a convenient source of various growth and other factors that may be useful in practical medicine.</description><updated>1522357200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195035</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195035</canonicalUrl><title>Response of human normal and leukemia cells to factors released by amnion fragments &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><published>1522357200000</published><fingerprint>93b0fe42</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zofia Grzywocz, Grazyna Hoser, Stanislawa Sabalinska, Piotr Ladyzynski, Jaroslaw Czubak, Malgorzata Dworczynska, Romuald Debski, Ewa Pius-Sadowska, Boguslaw Machalinski, Jerzy Kawiak&lt;/p&gt;

The conditioned medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion is easy to obtain and is a convenient source of various growth and other factors that may be useful in practical medicine.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Zofia Grzywocz</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195035</link></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a529838:34f43e70</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/45-e?rss=1</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/45-e?rss=1</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/45.5.full</canonicalUrl><title>A revealing view of oxides</title><published>1522950073000</published><fingerprint>af2f12a4</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/45-e?rss=1</link><author><name>Lavine, M.

Studies disrupting the chemokine pathway CX3CL1 (fractalkine)/ CX3CR1 have shown decreased atherosclerosis in animal models but the techniques used to interrupt the pathway have not been easily translatable into human trials. DNA vaccination potentially overcomes the translational difficulties. We evaluated the effect of a DNA vaccine, targeted to CX3CR1, on atherosclerosis in a murine model and examined possible mechanisms of action. DNA vaccination against CX3CR1, enhanced by dendritic cell targeting using DEC-205 single chain variable region fragment (scFv), was performed in 8 week old ApoE-/- mice, fed a normal chow diet. High levels of anti-CX3CR1 antibodies were induced in vaccinated mice. There were no apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine. Arterial vessels of 34 week old mice were examined histologically for atherosclerotic plaque size, macrophage infiltration, smooth muscle cell infiltration and lipid deposition. Vaccinated mice had significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque in the brachiocephalic artery. There was less macrophage infiltration but no significant change to the macrophage phenotype in the plaques. There was less lipid deposition in the lesions, but there was no effect on smooth muscle cell migration. Targeted DNA vaccination to CX3CR1 was well tolerated, induced a strong immune response and resulted in attenuated atherosclerotic lesions with reduced macrophage infiltration. DNA vaccination against chemokine pathways potentially offers a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</description><updated>1523480400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195657</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195657</canonicalUrl><title>DEC205-DC targeted DNA vaccine against CX3CR1 protects against atherogenesis in mice</title><published>1523480400000</published><fingerprint>4cb30a82</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jimmy Jianheng Zhou, Yuan Min Wang, Vincent W.

Living animal cells are strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of their environment. To model physiological conditions ultrasoft cell culture substrates, in some instances with elasticity (Young&apos;s modulus) of only 1 kPa, are mandatory. Due to their long shelf life PDMS-based elastomers are a popular choice. However, uncertainty about additives in commercial formulations and difficulties to reach very soft materials limit their use. Here, we produced silicone elastomers from few, chemically defined and commercially available substances. Elastomers exhibited elasticities in the range from 1 kPa to 55 kPa. In detail, a high molecular weight (155 kg/mol), vinyl-terminated linear silicone was crosslinked with a multifunctional (f = 51) crosslinker (a copolymer of dimethyl siloxane and hydrosilane) by a platinum catalyst. The following different strategies towards ultrasoft materials were explored: sparse crosslinking, swelling with inert silicone polymers, and, finally, deliberate introduction of dangling ends into the network (inhibition). Rheological experiments with very low frequencies led to precise viscoelastic characterizations. All strategies enabled tuning of stiffness with the lowest stiffness of ~1 kPa reached by inhibition. This system was also most practical to use. Biocompatibility of materials was tested using primary cortical neurons from rats. Even after several days of cultivation no adverse effects were found.</description><updated>1523048400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195180</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><title>Chemically defined, ultrasoft PDMS elastomers with selectable elasticity for mechanobiology</title><published>1523048400000</published><fingerprint>d866c0e8</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Viktor Heinrichs, Sabine Dieluweit, Jörg Stellbrink, Wim Pyckhout-Hintzen, Nils Hersch, Dieter Richter, Rudolf Merkel&lt;/p&gt;

Even after several days of cultivation no adverse effects were found.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Viktor Heinrichs</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195180</link></item><item><id>nWAmhAfvfdY6zhQafSMhdWASYooG1IX3uplCe3rnLYA=_162bb957efc:904b:a077e55f</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01196</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.7b01196/20180412/images/medium/ct-2017-01196t_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01196&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived significance of their work with the citation count as the most commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate scientific research. To better understand the relationship between metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of previously published research. Focusing on a specific issue of the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/i&gt; published in 2003, respondents were asked to select which articles they thought best matched importance and significance given several contexts: highest number of citations, most significant (subjectively defined), most likely to share among chemists, and most likely to share with a broader audience. The answers to the survey can be summed up in several observations. The ability of respondents to predict the citation counts of established research is markedly lower than the ability of those counts to be predicted by the h-index of the corresponding author of each article. This observation is conserved even when only considering responses from chemists whose expertise falls within the subdiscipline that best describes the work performed in an article. Respondents view both cited papers and significant papers differently than papers that should be shared with chemists. We conclude from our results that peer judgements of importance and significance differ from metrics-based measurements, and that chemists should work with bibliometricians to develop metrics that better capture the nuance of opinions on the importance of a given piece of research.</description><updated>1522270800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194903</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194903</canonicalUrl><title>Perception of the importance of chemistry research papers and comparison to citation rates</title><published>1522270800000</published><fingerprint>42b24064</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rachel Borchardt, Cullen Moran, Stuart Cantrill, Chemjobber, See Arr Oh, Matthew R.

This allows to obtain complete transcripts, which offers an unprecedented vision of the cellular transcriptome. However the literature is lacking tools to cluster such data de novo, in particular for Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads, because of the inherent high error rate compared to short reads. Our goal is to process reads from whole transcriptome sequencing data accurately and without a reference genome in order to reliably group reads coming from the same gene. This de novo approach is therefore particularly suitable for non-model species, but can also serve as a useful pre-processing step to improve read mapping. Our contribution is both to propose a new algorithm adapted to clustering of reads by gene and a practical and free access tool that permits to scale the complete processing of eukaryotic transcriptomes. We sequenced a mouse RNA sample using the MinION device, this dataset is used to compare our solution to other algorithms used in the context of biological clustering. We demonstrate its is better-suited for transcriptomics long reads. When a reference is available thus mapping possible, we show that it stands as an alternative method that predicts complementary clusters.</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/170035v4?rss=1</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522095857252</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/26/170035</canonicalUrl><title>Clustering de Novo by Gene of Long Reads from Transcriptomics Data [CONFIRMATORY RESULTS]</title><published>1522047600000</published><fingerprint>ec955eab</fingerprint><content><content>Long-read sequencing currently provides sequences of several thousand base pairs.

Our goal is to process reads from whole transcriptome sequencing data accurately and without a reference genome in order to reliably group reads coming from the same gene. This de novo approach is therefore particularly suitable for non-model species, but can also serve as a useful pre-processing step to improve read mapping. Our contribution is both to propose a new algorithm adapted to clustering of reads by gene and a practical and free access tool that permits to scale the complete processing of eukaryotic transcriptomes. We sequenced a mouse RNA sample using the MinION device, this dataset is used to compare our solution to other algorithms used in the context of biological clustering. We demonstrate its is better-suited for transcriptomics long reads. When a reference is available thus mapping possible, we show that it stands as an alternative method that predicts complementary clusters.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Marchet, C.</name></author><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/170035v4?rss=1</link></item><item><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_16296980fd7:a46656b:34f43e70</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4101</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metabolomics activity screening for identifying metabolites that modulate phenotype&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolomics activity screening for identifying metabolites that modulate phenotype, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4101&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Metabolomics activity screening can identify small-molecule metabolites that are readily available and can be used to alter phenotypes, including stem cell differentiation, T-cell survival, oligodendrocyte maturation, and insulin signaling.</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><engagement>2</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4101</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522944970711</crawled><title>Metabolomics activity screening for identifying metabolites that modulate phenotype</title><published>1522911600000</published><fingerprint>7708b9d4</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metabolomics activity screening for identifying metabolites that modulate phenotype&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolomics activity screening for identifying metabolites that modulate phenotype, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4101&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Metabolomics activity screening can identify small-molecule metabolites that are readily available and can be used to alter phenotypes, including stem cell differentiation, T-cell survival, oligodendrocyte maturation, and insulin signaling.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Carlos Guijas</name></author><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4101</link><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nbt.4101-F1.jpg</url><height>303</height><width>685</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162908f2b70:9a02289:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04052-0</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sciences unite in Spain to promote research for advancing society&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sciences unite in Spain to promote research for advancing society, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04052-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04052-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sciences unite in Spain to promote research for advancing society</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><engagement>6</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04052-0</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522843724656</crawled><title>Sciences unite in Spain to promote research for advancing society</title><published>1522825200000</published><fingerprint>ef3658b0</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sciences unite in Spain to promote research for advancing society&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sciences unite in Spain to promote research for advancing society, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04052-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04052-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sciences unite in Spain to promote research for advancing society</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Fernando  Baquero</name></author><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04052-0</link><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c1:9aea0a7d</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195720</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Pike, George Dimopoulos&lt;/p&gt;
Mosquitoes that have been genetically engineered for resistance to human pathogens are a potential new tool for controlling vector-borne disease.

For example, between 22% and 42% of the effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Even higher percentages are found for men (35% - 57%). On the contrary, the positive effect of poor health at childhood on poor health at older ages is not significantly mediated by education and life-course trajectories. Education captures most of the mediating effect of parental socio-economic status. More specifically, between 66% and 75% of the indirect effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women.

Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused great public concerns due to its recent large outbreaks and a close association with microcephaly in fetus and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Rapid development of vaccines against ZIKV is a public health priority. To this end, we have constructed and purified recombinant ZIKV envelope protein using both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, and then tested their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in immune competent mice. Both protein immunogens elicited humoral and cellular immune responses, and protected immune competent mice from ZIKV challenge &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These products could be further evaluated either as stand-alone vaccine candidate, or used in a prime-and-boost regimen with other forms of ZIKV vaccine.</description><updated>1522270800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194860</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194860</canonicalUrl><title>Recombinant Zika virus envelope protein elicited protective immunity against Zika virus in immunocompetent mice</title><published>1522270800000</published><fingerprint>5750fff5</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Huabin Liang, Ruoheng Yang, Zhihua Liu, Min Li, Haitao Liu, Xia Jin&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of metabolic syndrome has markedly increased worldwide. However, studies in the United States show that it has remained stable or slightly declined in recent years. Whether this applies to other countries is presently unclear.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;We examined the trends in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components in Korea.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components was estimated in adults aged &gt;30 years from the Korean National Health Insurance Service data from 2009 to 2013. The revised National Cholesterol Education Program criteria were used to define metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Approximately 10 million individuals were analyzed annually. The age-adjusted prevalence of metabolic syndrome increased from 28.84% to 30.52%, and the increasing trend was more prominent in men. Prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-cholesterol, and impaired fasting plasma glucose significantly increased. However, the prevalence of hypertension decreased in both genders. The prevalence of abdominal obesity decreased in women over 50 years-of-age but significantly increased in young women and men (&amp;lt;50 years).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is still increasing in Korea. Trends in each component of metabolic syndrome are disparate according to the gender, or age groups. Notably, abdominal obesity among young adults increased significantly; thus, interventional strategies should be implemented particularly for this age group.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1521752400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194490</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194490</canonicalUrl><title>Trends in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components in South Korea: Findings from the Korean National Health Insurance Service Database (2009–2013)</title><published>1521752400000</published><fingerprint>56ac19b0</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Eun Lee, Kyungdo Han, Yu Mi Kang, Seon-Ok Kim, Yun Kyung Cho, Kyung Soo Ko, Joong-Yeol Park, Ki-Up Lee, Eun Hee Koh, on Behalf of the Taskforce Team of Diabetes Fact Sheet of the Korean Diabetes Association &lt;/p&gt;

Copper-64 is an attractive radionuclide for PET imaging and is frequently used in clinical applications. The aim of this study was to perform a side-by-side comparison of the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; performance of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (NODAGA = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid,4,7-acetic acid, JR11 = p-Cl-Phe-cyclo(D-Cys-Aph(Hor)-D-Aph(cbm)-Lys-Thr-Cys)D-Tyr-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist, with the clinically used sst2 agonist &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE ((TATE = D-Phe-cyclo(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys)Thr). &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies demonstrated K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; values of 5.7±0.95 nM (Bmax = 4.1±0.18 nM) for the antagonist &lt;sup&gt;64/nat&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 and 20.1±4.4. nM (Bmax = 0.48±0.18 nM) for the agonist &lt;sup&gt;64/nat&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE. Cell uptake studies showed the expected differences between agonists and antagonists. Whereas &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE (the agonist) showed very effective internalization in the cell culture assay (with 50% internalized at 4 hours post-peptide addition under the given experimental conditions), &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (the antagonist) showed little internalization but strong receptor-mediated uptake at the cell membrane. Biodistribution studies of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Specificity of tumor uptake was proven by co-injection of high excess of non-radiolabeled peptide, which led to &gt;80% tumor blocking. &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE showed less favorable pharmacokinetics, with the exception of lower kidney uptake. Blood clearance was distinctly slower and persistent higher blood values were found at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and lung was relatively high and also persistent. The tumor uptake was specific and similar to that of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 at 1 h, but release from the tumor was very fast, particularly between 4 and 24 hours. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios were distinctly lower after 1 hour. This is indicative of insufficient &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; stability. PET studies of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 reflected the biodistribution data with nicely delineated tumor and low background. &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 shows promising pharmacokinetic properties for further translation into the clinic.</description><updated>1524085200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195802</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524074227579</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195802</canonicalUrl><title>The somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist &amp;lt;sup&gt;64&amp;lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 outperforms &amp;lt;sup&gt;64&amp;lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE in a mouse xenograft model</title><published>1524085200000</published><fingerprint>1d9f00fd</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Svetlana N.

Understanding species-specific changes in water-use patterns under recent climate scenarios is necessary to predict accurately the responses of seasonally dry ecosystems to future climate. In this study, we conducted a precipitation manipulation experiment to investigate the changes in water-use patterns of two coexisting species (&lt;i&gt;Achnatherum splendens&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Allium tanguticum&lt;/i&gt;) to alterations in soil water content (SWC) resulting from increased and decreased rainfall treatments. The results showed that the leaf water potential (Ψ) of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;splendens&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tanguticum&lt;/i&gt; responded to changes in shallow and middle SWC at both the control and treatment plots. However, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;splendens&lt;/i&gt; proportionally extracted water from the shallow soil layer (0–10cm) when it was available but shifted to absorbing deep soil water (30–60 cm) during drought. By contrast, the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tanguticum&lt;/i&gt; did not differ significantly in uptake depth between treatment and control plots but entirely depended on water from shallow soil layers. The flexible water-use patterns of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;splendens&lt;/i&gt; may be a key factor facilitating its dominance and it better acclimates the recent climate change in the alpine grassland community around Qinghai Lake.</description><updated>1524258000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194242</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194242</canonicalUrl><title>Contrasting response of coexisting plant’s water-use patterns to experimental precipitation manipulation in an alpine grassland community of Qinghai Lake watershed, China</title><published>1524258000000</published><fingerprint>abbf8360</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Huawu Wu, Jing Li, Xiao-Yan Li, Bin He, Jinzhao Liu, Zhiyun Jiang, Cicheng Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Aims &lt;p&gt;To compare the effectiveness of integrated care with that of the diabetes clinic care model in terms of mortality and hospitalisation of type 2 diabetes patients with low risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Out of 27234 people with type 2 diabetes residing in the province of Reggio Emilia on 31/12/2011, 3071 were included in this cohort study as eligible for integrated care (i.e., low risk of complications) and cared for with the same care model for at least two years. These patients were followed up from 2012 to 2016, for all-cause and diabetes-related mortality and hospital admissions. We performed a Poisson regression model, using the proportion of eligible patients included in the integrated care model for each general practitioner as an instrumental variable.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1700 patients were cared for by integrated care and 1371 by diabetes clinics. Mortality rate ratios were 0.83 (95%CI 0.60–1.13) and 0.95 (95%CI 0.54–1.70) for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively, and incidence rate ratios were 0.90 (95%CI 0.76–1.06) and 0.91 (95%CI 0.69–1.20) for all-cause and cardiovascular disease hospitalisation, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;For low risk patients with type 2 diabetes, the integrated care model involving both general practitioner and diabetes clinic professionals showed similar mortality and hospitalisation as a model with higher use of specialized care in an exclusively diabetes clinic setting.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1522184400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194784</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194784</canonicalUrl><title>Effectiveness of integrated care model for type 2 diabetes: A population-based study in Reggio Emilia (Italy)</title><published>1522184400000</published><fingerprint>bcb5debf</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paola Ballotari, Francesco Venturelli, Valeria Manicardi, Francesca Ferrari, Massimo Vicentini, Marina Greci, Fabio Pignatti, Simone Storani, Paolo Giorgi Rossi&lt;/p&gt;

Mortality rate ratios were 0.83 (95%CI 0.60–1.13) and 0.95 (95%CI 0.54–1.70) for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively, and incidence rate ratios were 0.90 (95%CI 0.76–1.06) and 0.91 (95%CI 0.69–1.20) for all-cause and cardiovascular disease hospitalisation, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;For low risk patients with type 2 diabetes, the integrated care model involving both general practitioner and diabetes clinic professionals showed similar mortality and hospitalisation as a model with higher use of specialized care in an exclusively diabetes clinic setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Paola Ballotari</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194784</link></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087f4:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194956</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1521666000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194956</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194956</canonicalUrl><title>Correction: Hydrophobic durability characteristics of butterfly wing surface after freezing cycles towards the design of nature inspired anti-icing surfaces</title><published>1521666000000</published><fingerprint>dbb10d9a</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194956</link><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344158:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195865</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Toru Maekawa, Stephen J.

The study of visual perception has largely been completed without regard to the influence that an individual’s emotional status may have on their performance in visual tasks. However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that mood may affect not only creative abilities and interpersonal skills but also the capacity to perform low-level cognitive tasks. Here, we sought to determine whether rudimentary visual search processes are similarly affected by emotion. Specifically, we examined whether an individual’s perceived happiness level affects their ability to detect a target in noise. To do so, we employed pop-out and serial visual search paradigms, implemented using a novel smartphone application that allowed search times and self-rated levels of happiness to be recorded throughout each twenty-four-hour period for two weeks. This experience sampling protocol circumvented the need to alter mood artificially with laboratory-based induction methods. Using our smartphone application, we were able to replicate the classic visual search findings, whereby pop-out search times remained largely unaffected by the number of distractors whereas serial search times increased with increasing number of distractors. While pop-out search times were unaffected by happiness level, serial search times with the maximum numbers of distractors (n = 30) were significantly faster for high happiness levels than low happiness levels (p = 0.02). Our results demonstrate the utility of smartphone applications in assessing ecologically valid measures of human visual performance. We discuss the significance of our findings for the assessment of basic visual functions using search time measures, and for our ability to search effectively for targets in real world settings.</description><updated>1523998800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195865</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523986744698</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195865</canonicalUrl><title>The effect of mood state on visual search times for detecting a target in noise: An application of smartphone technology</title><published>1523998800000</published><fingerprint>1ceb0ce8</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Toru Maekawa, Stephen J.

Cancer affects 39.6% of Americans at some point during their lifetime. Solid tumor microenvironments are characterized by a disorganized, leaky vasculature that promotes regions of low oxygenation (hypoxia). Tumor hypoxia is a key predictor of poor treatment outcome for all radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy and surgery procedures, and is a hallmark of metastatic potential. In particular, the radiation therapy dose needed to achieve the same tumor control probability in hypoxic tissue as in normoxic tissue can be up to 3 times higher. Even very small tumors (&amp;lt;2–3 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) comprise 10–30% of hypoxic regions in the form of chronic and/or transient hypoxia fluctuating over the course of seconds to days. We investigate the potential of recently developed lipid-stabilized oxygen microbubbles (OMBs) to improve the therapeutic ratio of RT. OMBs, but not nitrogen microbubbles (NMBs), are shown to significantly increase dissolved oxygen content when added to water in vitro and increase tumor oxygen levels in vivo in a rat fibrosarcoma model. Tumor control is significantly improved with OMB but not NMB intra-tumoral injections immediately prior to RT treatment and effect size is shown to depend on initial tumor volume on RT treatment day, as expected.</description><updated>1523307600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195667</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195667</canonicalUrl><title>Oxygen microbubbles improve radiotherapy tumor control in a rat fibrosarcoma model – A preliminary study</title><published>1523307600000</published><fingerprint>159357f9</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samantha M.

Novel rutin-loaded zein-sodium caseinate nanoparticles (ZP) with antioxidant activity in aqueous medium were investigated. The results showed that the sodium caseinate concentrations, dosages of rutin and ethanol volume fractions significantly affected the zein nanoparticles’ characteristics. Concerning the antioxidant properties, the highest values of rutin loaded ZP obtained using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging and 2 and 2&apos;-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) decolourisation assays were 52.7% and 71.2%, respectively, and the total antioxidant capacity was 0.40 nmol g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;In a study conducted in Bhopal district (a setting with facility for molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST)) located in central India in 2014–15, we found high levels of pre-diagnosis attrition among patients with presumptive multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)–meaning TB patients who were eligible for DST, were not being tested.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored the health care provider perspectives into barriers and suggested solutions for improving DST.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a descriptive qualitative study. One to one interviews (n = 10) and focus group discussions (n = 2) with experienced key informants involved in programmatic management of DR-TB were conducted in April 2017. Manual descriptive thematic analysis was performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The key barriers reported were a) lack of or delay in identification of patients eligible for DST because of using treatment register as the source for identifying patients b) lack of assured specimen transport after patient identification and c) lack of tracking. Extra pulmonary TB patients were not getting identified as eligible for DST. Solutions suggested by the health care providers were i) generation of unique identifier at identification in designated microscopy center (DMC), immediate intimation of unique identifier to district and regular monitoring by senior TB laboratory and senior treatment supervisors of patients eligible for DST that were missed; ii) documentation of unique identifier at each step of cascade; iii) use of human carriers/couriers to transport specimen from DMCs especially in rural areas; and iv) routine entry of all presumptive extra-pulmonary TB specimen, as far as possible, in DMC laboratory register.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Lack of assured specimen transport and lack of accountability for tracking patient after identification and referral were the key barriers. The identification of patients eligible for DST among microbiologically confirmed TB at the time of diagnosis and among clinically confirmed TB at the time of treatment initiation is the key. Use of unique identifier at identification and its use to ensure cohort wise tracking has to be complemented with specimen transport support and prompt feedback to the DMC. The study has implications to improve detection of MDR-TB among diagnosed/notified TB patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1524258000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196162</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196162</canonicalUrl><title>Provider reported barriers and solutions to improve testing among tuberculosis patients ‘eligible for drug susceptibility test’: A qualitative study from programmatic setting in India</title><published>1524258000000</published><fingerprint>a647418a</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hemant Deepak Shewade, Arun M.

Extra pulmonary TB patients were not getting identified as eligible for DST. Solutions suggested by the health care providers were i) generation of unique identifier at identification in designated microscopy center (DMC), immediate intimation of unique identifier to district and regular monitoring by senior TB laboratory and senior treatment supervisors of patients eligible for DST that were missed; ii) documentation of unique identifier at each step of cascade; iii) use of human carriers/couriers to transport specimen from DMCs especially in rural areas; and iv) routine entry of all presumptive extra-pulmonary TB specimen, as far as possible, in DMC laboratory register.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Lack of assured specimen transport and lack of accountability for tracking patient after identification and referral were the key barriers. The identification of patients eligible for DST among microbiologically confirmed TB at the time of diagnosis and among clinically confirmed TB at the time of treatment initiation is the key. Use of unique identifier at identification and its use to ensure cohort wise tracking has to be complemented with specimen transport support and prompt feedback to the DMC. The study has implications to improve detection of MDR-TB among diagnosed/notified TB patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Hemant Deepak Shewade</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196162</link></item><item><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162ce5485f1:29ae598:9f3b30f2</id><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13460</originId><description>There’s clearly something wrong with the way that statistics get handled and interpreted in scientific studies, and there have been many warnings.

But change in this area is a hard thing to bring about. &lt;em&gt;Biocentury&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biocentury.com/biocentury/regulation/2018-04-12/why-john-ioannidis-says-norm-p-values-should-shift-0005&quot;&gt;a good interview&lt;/a&gt; with someone who can tell you about that, John Ioannidis, of scientific reproducibility fame. He’s recently set off a lot of comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2676503?redirect=true&quot;&gt;with a proposal&lt;/a&gt; to lower the threshold for “significance” to p &amp;lt; 0.005, and as you’d imagine, there are some strong opinions on that. His estimate is that this would shift about a third of the published biomedical results to “suggestive” rather than significant, and his take on this is, basically “good riddance”. According to Ioannidis, a lot of those are false positives anyway, and a lot of the ones that are real are not really useful. Here’s the root of the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: What is the correct way to think about a p-value?&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: A p-value is the probability or the chance that you’ll see a result that is so extreme as the one that you see if the null hypothesis is true and if there is no bias. Many people say a p-value is the chance of the null hypothesis being wrong, of some effect being there. This completely ignores the fact that you have these two ‘ifs’ that are required to interpret the p-value. So it is the chance of seeing such an extreme result, or something even more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true and if we have no bias.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he’s upfront about the fact that his suggested new threshold is not the final answer, but just an interim step towards larger reforms. He wants to see better experimental and trial designs (Bayesian and traditional), larger sample sizes, and more attention paid to potential sources of bias and to effect size. In fact, if people just go wild for the new, stricter p-values, it’ll be a loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: Don’t you have a concern that by moving to a smaller p-value you are reinforcing the fetish about p-values and driving people to create enormous data sets? With data sets that are big enough, you can get very small p-values, but that doesn’t mean the results mean anything.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: Absolutely. And this is why 80% of the literature should not be using p-values, maybe 90% of the literature. With huge amounts of data, with big data, using a p-value means nothing, because everything can be statistically significant at 0.05 or even at 0.005. &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the question is, how do you change the mentality of people who are kind of automatically hooked to using a single magic number? It’s not that the alternative approaches that are better, like using effect size and confidence intervals or using Bayesian statistics, are recent. They have been out there for a long time, but their adoption, even though it is accelerating, has not been what we want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, he thinks that p-value is the right tool for the job about 20% of the time, whereas Bayesian measures could be useful half the time, maybe even more. One instant objection to the idea of lowering p-value cutoffs is that it will make everything much more expensive and time-consuming (clinical trials, first and foremost), but his contention is that it doesn’t have to be that way. Better designs and more appropriate measures could cancel a lot of the brute-force bigger-sample stuff – and you get the impression that he’s deliberately pushing people towards those by making it too expensive to do it the old way. “We have some very strong tools that we don’t apply”, says Ioannidis, and he’s going to try to make people apply them, one way or another. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><engagementRate>0.07</engagementRate><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13460</link></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162b3f687a2:435f40:9f3b30f2</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outsourcing is in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing is in, Published online: 11 April 2018;

Aims &lt;p&gt;Jumonji Domain-Containing 1A (JMJD1A) protein promotes demethylation of histones, especially at lysin-9 of di-methylated histone H3 (H3K9me2) or mono-methylated (H3K9me1). Increased levels of H3 histone methylation at lysin-9 (H3K9) is related to tumor suppressor gene silencing. &lt;i&gt;JMJD1A&lt;/i&gt; gene target Adrenomeduline (ADM) has shown to promote cell growth and tumorigenesis. JMJD1A and ADM expression, as well as H3K9 methylation level have been related with development risk and prognosis of several tumor types.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We aimed to evaluate JMJD1A, ADM, H3K9me1 and H3K9me2expression in paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays from 84 oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma samples through immunohistochemistry analysis. Our results showed that nuclear JMJD1A expression was related to lymph node metastasis risk. In addition, JMJD1A cytoplasmic expression was an independent risk marker for advanced tumor stages.

Aims &lt;p&gt;Jumonji Domain-Containing 1A (JMJD1A) protein promotes demethylation of histones, especially at lysin-9 of di-methylated histone H3 (H3K9me2) or mono-methylated (H3K9me1). Increased levels of H3 histone methylation at lysin-9 (H3K9) is related to tumor suppressor gene silencing. &lt;i&gt;JMJD1A&lt;/i&gt; gene target Adrenomeduline (ADM) has shown to promote cell growth and tumorigenesis. JMJD1A and ADM expression, as well as H3K9 methylation level have been related with development risk and prognosis of several tumor types.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We aimed to evaluate JMJD1A, ADM, H3K9me1 and H3K9me2expression in paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays from 84 oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma samples through immunohistochemistry analysis. Our results showed that nuclear JMJD1A expression was related to lymph node metastasis risk. In addition, JMJD1A cytoplasmic expression was an independent risk marker for advanced tumor stages. H3K9me1 cytoplasmic expression was associated with reduced disease-specific death risk. Furthermore, high H3K9me2 nuclear expression was associated with worse specific-disease and disease-free survival. Finally, high ADM cytoplasmic expression was an independent marker of lymph node metastasis risk.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;JMJD1A, H3K9me1/2 and ADM expression may be predictor markers of progression and prognosis in oral and oropharynx cancer patients, as well as putative therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Lucas de Lima Maia</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194884</link></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fecea2:34f43e70</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/160?rss=1</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><engagement>3</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/160?rss=1</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/160.full</canonicalUrl><title>Adapting to life in the big city</title><keywords><item>Evolution</item></keywords><fingerprint>7cef08aa</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/160?rss=1</link><author><name>Mooers, A.</name></author><published>1523554635000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_162789b6a07:1221751:bdf8aaf1</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00190</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00190/20180330/images/medium/bi-2018-00190s_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00190&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Here we developed a computational technique combining structural bioinformatics approaches and atomic-level free energy simulations to characterize how the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; DNA repair enzyme UvrD changes its conformation at the fork junction to switch its function from unwinding to rezipping DNA. The lowest free energy path shows that UvrD opens the interface between two domains, allowing the bound ssDNA to escape. The simulation results predict a key metastable &apos;tilted&apos; state during ssDNA strand switching. By simulating FRET distributions with fluorophores attached to UvrD, we show that the new state is supported quantitatively by single-molecule measurements. The present study deciphers key elements for the &apos;hyper-helicase&apos; behavior of a mutant, and provides an effective framework to characterize directly structure-function relationships in molecular machines.</description><summary><content>Helicases play key roles in genome maintenance, yet it remains elusive how these enzymes change conformations and how transitions between different conformational states regulate nucleic acid reshaping.

The lowest free energy path shows that UvrD opens the interface between two domains, allowing the bound ssDNA to escape. The simulation results predict a key metastable &apos;tilted&apos; state during ssDNA strand switching. By simulating FRET distributions with fluorophores attached to UvrD, we show that the new state is supported quantitatively by single-molecule measurements. The present study deciphers key elements for the &apos;hyper-helicase&apos; behavior of a mutant, and provides an effective framework to characterize directly structure-function relationships in molecular machines.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>2</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34186</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523966238870</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34186</canonicalUrl><title>Free energy simulations reveal molecular mechanism for functional switch of a DNA helicase</title><keywords><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><fingerprint>b06f07d7</fingerprint><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34186</link><author><name>ychemla@illinois.edu (Kevin D Whitley)</name></author><engagementRate>0.13</engagementRate><published>1523923200000</published></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162d2efb3bf:300ee51:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03803-x</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cooperative STAT/NF-κB signaling regulates lymphoma metabolic reprogramming and aberrant &lt;i&gt;GOT2&lt;/i&gt; expression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooperative STAT/NF-κB signaling regulates lymphoma metabolic reprogramming and aberrant &amp;lt;i&gt;GOT2&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03803-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03803-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Metabolic rewiring of cancer cells can be driven by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors.

It has been suggested that tactile signals are suppressed on a moving limb to free capacities for processing other relevant sensory signals. In line with this notion, we recently showed that tactile suppression is indeed stronger in the presence of reach-relevant somatosensory signals. Here we examined whether this effect also generalizes to the processing of additional visual signals during reaching. Brief vibrotactile stimuli were presented on the participants’ right index finger either during right-hand reaching to a previously illuminated target LED, or during rest. Participants had to indicate whether they detected the vibrotactile stimulus or not. The target LED remained off (&lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt;), or was briefly illuminated (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt;) during reaching, providing additional reach-relevant visual information about the target position. If tactile suppression frees capacities for &lt;i&gt;reach-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual information, suppression should be stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt; condition. In an additional visual-discrimination condition (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt;), the target LED flashed once or twice during reaching and participants had to also report the number of flashes. If tactile suppression occurs to free additional capacities for &lt;i&gt;perception-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual signals, tactile suppression should be even stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; condition. We found that additional visual signals improved reach endpoint accuracy and precision. In all conditions, reaching led to tactile suppression as indicated by higher detection thresholds compared to rest, confirming previous findings. However, tactile suppression was comparable between conditions arguing against the hypothesis that it frees capacities for processing other relevant visual signals.</description><updated>1522875600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</canonicalUrl><title>The role of visual processing on tactile suppression</title><published>1522875600000</published><fingerprint>ba854dbd</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Gertz, Katja Fiehler, Dimitris Voudouris&lt;/p&gt;

Outbreaks of novel highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been reported in poultry species in the United States since 2014. These outbreaks have proven the limitations of biosecurity control programs, and new tools are needed to reinforce the current avian influenza control arsenal. Some enzootic countries have implemented inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in their control programs, but there are serious concerns that a long-term use of IIV without eradication may result in the selection of novel antigenically divergent strains. A broadly protective vaccine is needed, such as live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We showed in our previous studies that pc4-LAIV (a variant that encodes a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein) can provide significant protection against heterologous challenge virus in chickens vaccinated at 2–4 weeks of age through upregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The current study was conducted to compare the performances of pc4-LAIV and IIV in young chickens vaccinated at 1 day of age. A single dose of pc4-LAIV was able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of IIV. Most importantly, when 1-day-old chickens were intranasally primed with pc4-LAIV and subcutaneously boosted with IIV three weeks later, they showed a rapid, robust, and highly cross-reactive serum antibody response and a high level of mucosal IgA antibody response. This vaccination regimen warrants further optimization to increase its range of protection.</description><updated>1523048400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195285</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><title>Efficacy and synergy of live-attenuated and inactivated influenza vaccines in young chickens</title><published>1523048400000</published><fingerprint>260bbdf1</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyesun Jang, Mohamed Elaish, Mahesh KC, Michael C.

Recent advances suggest that impairment in social cognition (SC) may play a role in the development of social anxiety (SA). However, very few studies have analyzed whether SA fosters poorer social-cognitive development as it leads to social avoidance. This study aimed to analyze whether retrospectively assessed behavioral inhibition (BI) (i.e., an early form of SA) in childhood is associated with a deficit in social cognition operationalized as impairment of mentalizing (MZ) in adolescence. A sample of 256 adolescents (range: 12–18 years; mean age: 14.7 years; &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 1.7) from general population were assessed for MZ capacities and retrospective BI through self-report and interview measures. Results comparing three groups of adolescents with different levels of childhood BI (low, moderate or high) and controlling for concurrent SA and depression reveal that the higher the level of BI, the lower the level of MZ. These results were consistent for almost all mentalization measures, including when both extreme (i.e., high vs. low BI) and non-extreme (i.e., high vs. moderate BI) were compared in both self-report and interview measures and in both dimensions of MZ (i.e., MZ referred to others’ and to own mental states). These findings support that childhood forms of SA are associated to deficit in SC in adolescence. A possible bi-directional relationship between SA and SC, and the role that it may play in the pathway to clinical SA are discussed.</description><updated>1522357200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195303</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195303</canonicalUrl><title>Childhood behavioral inhibition is associated with impaired mentalizing in adolescence</title><published>1522357200000</published><fingerprint>e784a6d6</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sergi Ballespí, Ariadna Pérez-Domingo, Jaume Vives, Carla Sharp, Neus Barrantes-Vidal&lt;/p&gt;

The partial repair phenotypes suggest that compensatory pathways limit improvement. Gene expression profiles of mice deficient in &lt;i&gt;Ngr1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a receptor for myelin-associated inhibitors of axonal regeneration such as Nogo, revealed that trauma increased the mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;ORL1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes the receptor for the opioid-related peptide nociceptin.

The partial repair phenotypes suggest that compensatory pathways limit improvement. Gene expression profiles of mice deficient in &lt;i&gt;Ngr1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a receptor for myelin-associated inhibitors of axonal regeneration such as Nogo, revealed that trauma increased the mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;ORL1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes the receptor for the opioid-related peptide nociceptin.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We wanted to re-evaluate the influence of confined placental mosaicism subtypes (type 2 and type 3) on pregnancy characteristics and outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;From July 2009 to December 2015, 5512 chorionic villus samplings were performed in our Fetal Medicine Center. Conventional karyotyping was performed after long-term and short-term cultured villi to define type 2 or type 3 confined placental mosaicisms. Karyotype after amniocentesis was performed to exclude true fetal mosaicism, when appropriate. Pregnancy characteristics and outcomes were collected and compared to a control population.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-six (0.65%) confined placental mosaicisms were observed (13 type 2 and 23 type 3). Nuchal translucency was not increased for type 2 and type 3 confined placental mosaicisms. Pregnancy characteristics and outcomes were comparable between type 2 confined placental mosaicisms and the control population. In type 3 confined placental mosaicisms, median first trimester serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A was lower than for the control population (p&amp;lt;0.001), preterm births were noticed in 56% (p&amp;lt;0.001), small for gestational age newborns in 74% (p&amp;lt;0.001), and adverse pregnancy outcome was reported in 35% (p&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Although type 2 confined placental mosaicisms appeared to have no influence on pregnancy characteristics and outcome, type 3 confined placental mosaicisms were associated with low levels of first trimester serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, preterm birth, small for gestational age newborns, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1523566800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195905</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195905</canonicalUrl><title>Confined placental mosaicism revisited: Impact on pregnancy characteristics and outcome</title><published>1523566800000</published><fingerprint>4732019a</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jérôme Toutain, Damien Goutte-Gattat, Jacques Horovitz, Robert Saura&lt;/p&gt;

The regulatory role of miRNAs has been explored in ovarian cells, and their effects on gonadal development, apoptosis, ovulation, steroid production and corpus luteum (CL) development have been revealed. In this study, we analyzed the expression of miR-29b at different stages of bovine CL development and predicted the target genes of miR-29b. We confirmed that miR-29b reduces the expression of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), affects progesterone (PROG) secretion and regulates the function of the CL. RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-29b was significantly higher in functional CL phases than in the regressed CL phase. Immunohistochemistry showed that OXTR was expressed in both large and small CL cells and was mainly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of these cells. We analyzed the expression levels of OXTR and found that transfection with a miR-29b mimic decreased OXTR expression, but transfection with the inhibitor had a limited effect on the expression of the OXTR protein. At the same time, the secretion of PROG was significantly increased in the miR-29b mimic-transfected group. We also analyzed the effect of miR-29b on the apoptosis of CL cells. Finally, we found that miR-29b could promote the proliferation of bovine CL cells. In conclusion, we found that miR-29b reduces the expression of OXTR and can promote PROG secretion and the proliferation of CL cells via OXTR.</description><updated>1522875600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195562</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195562</canonicalUrl><title>MiR-29b affects the secretion of PROG and promotes the proliferation of bovine corpus luteum cells</title><published>1522875600000</published><fingerprint>b880d74f</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ming-Qiang Xu, Hao Jiang, Li-Qun Zhang, Xu-Lei Sun, Dan Luo, Yao Fu, Yan Gao, Bao Yuan, Jia-Bao Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

The precursor ribosomal RNA is processed by multiple steps of nucleolytic cleavage to generate mature rRNAs. Utp24 is a PIN domain endonuclease in the early 90S precursor of small ribosomal subunit and is proposed to cleave at sites A1 and A2 of pre-rRNA. Here we determine the crystal structure of Utp24 from &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt; at 2.1 angstrom resolution. Utp24 structurally resembles the ribosome assembly factor Utp23 and both contain a Zn-finger motif. Functional analysis in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; shows that depletion of Utp24 disturbs the assembly of 90S and abolishes cleavage at sites A0, A1 and A2. The 90S assembled with inactivated Utp24 is arrested at a post-A0-cleavage state and contains enriched nuclear exosome for degradation of 5&apos; ETS. Despite of high sequence conservation, Utp24 from other organisms is unable to form an active 90S in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that Utp24 needs to be precisely positioned in 90S.

Most weakly electric fish navigate and communicate by sensing electric signals generated by their muscle-derived electric organs. Adults of one lineage (Apteronotidae), which discharge their electric organs in excess of 1 kHz, instead have an electric organ derived from the axons of specialized spinal neurons (electromotorneurons [EMNs]). EMNs fire spontaneously and are the fastest-firing neurons known. This biophysically extreme phenotype depends upon a persistent sodium current, the molecular underpinnings of which remain unknown. We show that a skeletal muscle–specific sodium channel gene duplicated in this lineage and, within approximately 2 million years, began expressing in the spinal cord, a novel site of expression for this isoform. Concurrently, amino acid replacements that cause a persistent sodium current accumulated in the regions of the channel underlying inactivation. Therefore, a novel adaptation allowing extreme neuronal firing arose from the duplication, change in expression, and rapid sequence evolution of a muscle-expressing sodium channel gene.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pubkd-zrN1g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Ammon Thompson</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004892</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ammon Thompson, Daniel T.

Adults of one lineage (Apteronotidae), which discharge their electric organs in excess of 1 kHz, instead have an electric organ derived from the axons of specialized spinal neurons (electromotorneurons [EMNs]). EMNs fire spontaneously and are the fastest-firing neurons known. This biophysically extreme phenotype depends upon a persistent sodium current, the molecular underpinnings of which remain unknown. We show that a skeletal muscle–specific sodium channel gene duplicated in this lineage and, within approximately 2 million years, began expressing in the spinal cord, a novel site of expression for this isoform. Concurrently, amino acid replacements that cause a persistent sodium current accumulated in the regions of the channel underlying inactivation. Therefore, a novel adaptation allowing extreme neuronal firing arose from the duplication, change in expression, and rapid sequence evolution of a muscle-expressing sodium channel gene.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pubkd-zrN1g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f4:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195358</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Magdalena Joanna Grzeszczuk, Aleksandra Bąk, Anna Marta Banaś, Paweł Urbanowicz, Stanislaw Dunin-Horkawicz, Artur Gieldon, Cezary Czaplewski, Adam Liwo, Elżbieta K.

&lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; HP0377 is a thiol oxidoreductase, a member of the CcmG family involved in cytochrome biogenesis, as previously shown by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments. In this report, we document that HP0377 also acts &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in the cytochrome assembly process in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, where it complements the lack of ResA. However, unlike other characterized proteins in this family, HP0377 is a dithiol reductase and isomerase. We elucidated how the amino acid composition of its active site modulates its functionality. We demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-proline (P156) is involved in its interaction with the redox partner (CcdA), as a P156T HP0377 variant is inactive &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and is present in the oxidized form in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, we showed that engineering the HP0377 active motif by changing CSYC motif into CSYS or SSYC, clearly diminishes two activities (reduction and isomerization) of the protein. Whereas HP0377&lt;sub&gt;CSYA&lt;/sub&gt; is inactive in reduction as well as in isomerization, HP0377&lt;sub&gt;CSYS&lt;/sub&gt; retains reductive activity. Also, replacement of F95 by Q decreases its ability to regenerate scRNase and does not influence the reductive activity of HP0377&lt;sub&gt;CSYS&lt;/sub&gt; towards apocytochrome c. HP0377 is also distinguished from other CcmGs as it forms a 2:1 complex with apocytochrome c. Phylogenetic analyses showed that, although HP0377 is capable of complementing ResA in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, its thioredoxin domain has a different origin, presumably common to DsbC.</description><updated>1524258000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195358</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195358</canonicalUrl><title>Impact of selected amino acids of HP0377 (&amp;lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&amp;lt;/i&gt; thiol oxidoreductase) on its functioning as a CcmG (cytochrome c maturation) protein and Dsb (disulfide bond) isomerase</title><published>1524258000000</published><fingerprint>62cd017b</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Magdalena Joanna Grzeszczuk, Aleksandra Bąk, Anna Marta Banaś, Paweł Urbanowicz, Stanislaw Dunin-Horkawicz, Artur Gieldon, Cezary Czaplewski, Adam Liwo, Elżbieta K.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Maslinic acid (MA) is a component derived from a natural olive-based extract known to have pharmacological functions that include suppressing inflammation. This study examined how MA, in conjunction with whole-body vibration training (WBVT), can improve knee and muscle function in elderly women with knee osteoarthritis (OA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized intervention study that enrolled individuals with knee pain. Participants were 26 females aged 65–85 years with knee OA. They performed WBVT and ingested either 16.7 mg of MA or a placebo daily for 20 weeks. We compared the effect of WBVT with placebo (WBVT/P) and WBVT with MA (WBVT/MA) in participants with various degrees of knee OA (Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) grade) using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and isokinetic dynamometer measurements to evaluate knee and muscle function with two-way ANOVA.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Based on the results of two-way ANOVA analysis of muscle function measurements, there was significant interaction (time × group) (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) in the “isokinetic extension peak torque” domain for severe OA (K-L grade ≥ 3). The simple main effect of time in the WBVT/MA group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) contributed to this interaction. The JOA score for WBVT/MA supported the main effect of group as having a significant correlation in the “pain on walking” (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) and “range of motion” (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) domains. Participants with severe knee OA in the WBVT/MA group improved in these domains, whereas the WBVT/P group had few positive results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Participants with severe OA who ingested MA in conjunction with WBVT improved their knee and muscle function. This study suggests that ingesting the anti-inflammatory supplement MA while participating in WBVT, elderly women can reduce knee OA and improve their knee muscle strength.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1521579600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194572</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194572</canonicalUrl><title>Evaluation of maslinic acid with whole-body vibration training in elderly women with knee osteoarthritis</title><published>1521579600000</published><fingerprint>4d15aa92</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jieun Yoon, Akihiro Kanamori, Keisuke Fujii, Hiroko Isoda, Tomohiro Okura&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular events, with a corresponding growth in medical costs. High intensity lifestyle intervention (HILI) is the cornerstone for weight management. We assessed the effectiveness of clinic-based HILI on weight loss and associated clinical outcomes by duration of program participation and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who enrolled in HILI weight management programs at Health Management Resources (HMR) clinics located across the U.S. Patients completed health risk assessments (HRA) and were enrolled for up to 24 months at the time of follow-up HRA. HMR programs provide weekly group coaching to achieve reduced calorie intake, increased fruit/vegetable intake, and physical activity ≥2,000 kcal/wk. A Markov model predicted avoidance of diabetes and cardiovascular events and projected cost savings due to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 500 patients included in the analysis, 67% were female and mean age was 54.1 years (s.d. 11.6). The baseline weight and BMI were 243.5 lbs (range 144.0–545.0) and 38.8 kg/m2 (range 25.4–85.0), respectively. Overall, patients lost an average of 47.4 lbs (18.9% of initial body weight [IBW]); the amount of weight loss was consistent among those with diabetes/pre-diabetes (50%), high/moderate risk for dyslipidemia (60%), hypertension/pre-hypertension (86%), and severe obesity (37%).

Background &lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular events, with a corresponding growth in medical costs. High intensity lifestyle intervention (HILI) is the cornerstone for weight management. We assessed the effectiveness of clinic-based HILI on weight loss and associated clinical outcomes by duration of program participation and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who enrolled in HILI weight management programs at Health Management Resources (HMR) clinics located across the U.S. Patients completed health risk assessments (HRA) and were enrolled for up to 24 months at the time of follow-up HRA. HMR programs provide weekly group coaching to achieve reduced calorie intake, increased fruit/vegetable intake, and physical activity ≥2,000 kcal/wk. A Markov model predicted avoidance of diabetes and cardiovascular events and projected cost savings due to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 500 patients included in the analysis, 67% were female and mean age was 54.1 years (s.d. 11.6). The baseline weight and BMI were 243.5 lbs (range 144.0–545.0) and 38.8 kg/m2 (range 25.4–85.0), respectively. Overall, patients lost an average of 47.4 lbs (18.9% of initial body weight [IBW]); the amount of weight loss was consistent among those with diabetes/pre-diabetes (50%), high/moderate risk for dyslipidemia (60%), hypertension/pre-hypertension (86%), and severe obesity (37%). The mean IBW lost was 16.4%, 19.3%, 20.7% for ≤6 months (n = 165), 7–12 months (n = 140), 13–24 months (n = 195) of program participation, respectively. The simulation model estimated 22 diabetes and 30 cardiovascular events and $1,992,370 medical costs avoided over 5 years in the 500 patients evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Patients in the HMR clinic-based HILI program achieved substantial weight loss regardless of duration of program participation, risk profile and comorbid status.

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) that are symbiotically associated with &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria can kill target insects via direct infection and toxin action. There are limited reports identifying such organisms in the National Park of Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify EPNs and symbiotic bacteria from Nam Nao National Park, Phetchabun Province, Thailand and to evaluate the larvicidal activity of bacteria against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 12 EPN isolates belonging to &lt;i&gt;Steinernema&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heterorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; were obtained form 940 soil samples between February 2014 and July 2016. EPNs were molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;websteri&lt;/i&gt; (10 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates). Symbiotic bacteria were isolated from EPNs and molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (13 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (11 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonica&lt;/i&gt; (1 isolate). For the bioassay, bacterial suspensions were evaluated for toxicity against third to early fourth instar larvae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; spp. The larvae of both &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; species were orally susceptible to symbiotic bacteria. The highest larval mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; was 99% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (bNN112.3_TH) at 96 h, and the highest mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was 98% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (bNN121.4_TH) at 96 h. In contrast to the control groups (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and distilled water), the mortality rate of both mosquito larvae ranged between 0 and 7% at 72 h. Here, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand. Additionally, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; associated with &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand. &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; has potential to be a biocontrol agent for mosquitoes. This investigation provides a survey of the basic diversity of EPNs and symbiotic bacteria in the National Park of Thailand, and it is a bacterial resource for further studies of bioactive compounds.</description><updated>1523480400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195681</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195681</canonicalUrl><title>Identification of entomopathogenic nematodes and symbiotic bacteria from Nam Nao National Park in Thailand and larvicidal activity of symbiotic bacteria against &amp;lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><published>1523480400000</published><fingerprint>722bed90</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Temsiri Yooyangket, Paramaporn Muangpat, Raxsina Polseela, Sarunporn Tandhavanant, Aunchalee Thanwisai, Apichat Vitta&lt;/p&gt;

Despite this, transcriptomic analyses of the human brain have typically been conducted using macro-dissected tissue due to the difficulty of performing single-cell type analyses with donated post-mortem brains. To address this issue statistically, we compiled a database of several thousand transcripts that were specifically-enriched in one of 10 primary cortical cell types in previous publications. Using this database, we predicted the relative cell type composition for 833 human cortical samples using microarray or RNA-Seq data from the Pritzker Consortium (GSE92538) or publicly-available databases (GSE53987, GSE21935, GSE21138, CommonMind Consortium). These predictions were generated by averaging normalized expression levels across transcripts specific to each cell type using our R-package BrainInABlender (validated and publicly-released: https://github.com/hagenaue/BrainInABlender). Using this method, we found that the principal components of variation in the datasets strongly correlated with the neuron to glia ratio of the samples. This variability was not simply due to dissection - the relative balance of brain cell types appeared to be influenced by a variety of demographic, pre- and post-mortem variables. Prolonged hypoxia around the time of death predicted increased astrocytic and endothelial gene expression, illustrating vascular upregulation. Aging was associated with decreased neuronal gene expression. Red blood cell gene expression was reduced in individuals who died following systemic blood loss. Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder had decreased astrocytic gene expression, mirroring previous morphometric observations. Subjects with Schizophrenia had reduced red blood cell gene expression, resembling the hypofrontality detected in fMRI experiments. Finally, in datasets containing samples with especially variable cell content, we found that controlling for predicted sample cell content while evaluating differential expression improved the detection of previously-identified psychiatric effects.

The results illustrate the usefulness of SES and SES-defined physical and geometrical properties for the characterization of protein-solvent interaction and ligand-protein interaction where ligand could be either small molecule compound, or membrane lipid, or DNA or protein.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Wang, L.</name></author><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294025v1?rss=1</link></item><item><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f890d:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017532?af=R</originId><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017532?af=R</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><title>Path integral molecular dynamic simulation of flexible molecular systems in their ground state: Application to the water dimer</title><published>1522134653000</published><fingerprint>da267d51</fingerprint><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Matthew Schmidt</name></author><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017532?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162d525c55d:348c32c:34f43e70</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3645.short?rss=1</originId><description>Epidemics, flame propagation, and cardiac rhythms are classic examples of reaction–diffusion waves that describe a switch from one alternative state to another.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke, is linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is characterized by SUR1-TRPM4 (sulfonylurea receptor 1—transient receptor potential melastatin 4) channel upregulation in microvascular endothelium. In humans and rodents with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), the SUR1 antagonist, glibenclamide, reduces hemorrhagic transformation and plasma MMP-9, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that tPA induces protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-mediated, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium, and that SUR1-TRPM4 is required for this process.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R, of 2 and 4 hours duration, respectively, was obtained using conventional middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunolabeling was used to quantify p65 nuclear translocation. Murine and human brain endothelial cells (BEC) were studied &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, without and with NF-κB activation, using immunoblot, zymography and ELISA, patch clamp electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations were used to identify signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R caused prominent nuclear translocation of p65 in microvascular endothelium. NF-κB-activation of BEC caused &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; expression of SUR1-TRPM4 channels. In NF-κB-activated BEC: (i) tPA caused opening of SUR1-TRPM4 channels in a plasmin-, PAR1-, TRPC3- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner; (ii) tPA caused PAR1-dependent secretion of MMP-9; (iii) tonic secretion of MMP-9 by activated BEC was not influenced by SUR1 inhibition; (iv) phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA or the PAR1-agonist, TFLLR, required functional SUR1-TRPM4 channels, with inhibition of SUR1 decreasing tPA-induced MMP-9 secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;tPA induces PAR1-mediated, SUR1-TRPM4-dependent, phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1522875600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195526</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195526</canonicalUrl><title>SUR1-TRPM4 channel activation and phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA in brain endothelial cells</title><published>1522875600000</published><fingerprint>c656222e</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Volodymyr Gerzanich, Min Seong Kwon, Seung Kyoon Woo, Alexander Ivanov, J.

Design: Retrospective database study. Participants: All patients who obtained a HVF 24-2 at the University of Washington. Methods: All datapoints from consecutive 24-2 HVFs from 1998 to 2018 were extracted from a University of Washington database. Ten-fold cross validation with a held out test set was used to develop the three main phases of model development: model architecture selection, dataset combination selection, and time-interval model training with transfer learning, to train a deep learning artificial neural network capable of generating a point-wise visual field prediction. Main outcome measures: Mean absolute error (MAE) and difference in Mean Deviation (MD) between predicted and actual future HVF. Results: More than 1.7 million perimetry points were extracted to the hundredth decibel from 32,443 24-2 HVFs. The best performing model with 20 million trainable parameters, CascadeNet-5, was selected. The overall MAE for the test set was 2.47 dB (95% CI: 2.45 dB to 2.48 dB).

Hyperopia is a common refractive error, apparent in 25% of Europeans. Treatments include spectacles, contact lenses, laser interventions and surgery including implantable contact lenses and lens extraction. Laser treatment offers an expedient and reliable means of correcting ametropia. LASIK is well-established however SMILE (small-incision lenticule extraction) or lenticule implantation (derived from myopic laser-correction) are newer options. In this study we compared the outcomes of hyperopic LASIK, SMILE and lenticule re-implantation in a primate model at +2D/+4D treatment. While re-implantation showed the greatest regression, broadly comparable refractive results were seen at 3-months with SMILE and LASIK (&amp;lt;1.4D of intended), but a greater tendency to regression in +2D lenticule reimplantation. Central corneal thickness showed greater variation at +2D treatment, but central thickening during lenticule reimplantation at +4D treatment was seen (-17± 27μm LASIK, -45 ± 18μm SMILE and 28 ± 17μm Re-implantation; p &amp;lt;0.01) with expected paracentral thinning following SMILE. Although in vivo confocal microscopy appeared to show higher reflectivity in all +4D treatment groups, there were minimal and inconsistent changes in inflammatory responses between modalities. SMILE and lenticule re-implantation may represent a safe and viable method for treating hyperopia, but further optimization for lower hyperopic treatments is warranted.</description><updated>1522270800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</canonicalUrl><title>Hyperopic refractive correction by LASIK, SMILE or lenticule reimplantation in a non-human primate model</title><published>1522270800000</published><fingerprint>11fd5c8c</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Geraint P.

Diverse cells types have been shown to regulate their numbers via secretion of factors in the extracellular space. These factors act as a proxy for the number of cells and function to reduce cellular proliferation rates creating a negative feedback. It is desirable that the production rate of such factors be kept as low as possible to minimize energy costs and detection by predators. Here we formulate a stochastic model of cell proliferation with feedback control via a secreted extracellular factor. Our results show that while low levels of feedback minimizes random fluctuations in cell numbers around a given set point, high levels of feedback amplify Poisson fluctuations in secreted-factor copy numbers. This trade-off results in an optimal feedback strength, and sets a fundamental limit to noise suppression in cell numbers. Intriguingly, this fundamental limit depends additively on two variables: relative half-life of the secreted factor with respect to the cell proliferation rate, and the average number of factors secreted in a cell&apos;s lifespan. We further expand the model to consider external disturbances in key physiological parameters, such as, proliferation and factor synthesis rates. Intriguingly, while negative feedback effectively mitigates disturbances in the proliferation rate, it amplifies disturbances in the synthesis rate.

Here we describe the chemical tools and target-related knowledge that have been made available, and encourage others to join the project.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34311</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524234559201</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34311</canonicalUrl><title>Donated chemical probes for open science</title><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item></keywords><fingerprint>e8191982</fingerprint><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34311</link><author><name>susanne.mueller-knapp@bmls.de (Adriaan IJzerman)</name></author><published>1524182400000</published></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793640:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196028</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Giorgia Antoni, Elisabetta Marini, Nicoletta Curreli, Valerio Tuveri, Ornella Comandini, Stefano Cabras, Silvia Gabba, Clelia Madeddu, Antonio Crisafulli, Andrea C.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) affects besides muscle also the brain, resulting in memory and behavioral problems. The consequences of dystrophinopathy on gross macroscopic alterations are unclear. To elucidate the effect of full-length dystrophin expression on brain morphology, we used high-resolution post-mortem MRI in mouse models that either express 0% (&lt;i&gt;mdx&lt;/i&gt;), 100% (BL10) or a low amount of full-length dystrophin (&lt;i&gt;mdx&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;Xist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Δhs&lt;/sup&gt;). While absence or low amounts of full-length dystrophin did not significantly affect whole brain volume and skull morphology, we found differences in volume of individual brain structures. The results are in line with observations in humans, where whole brain volume was found to be reduced only in patients lacking both full-length dystrophin and the shorter isoform Dp140.</description><updated>1522443600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194636</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194636</canonicalUrl><title>Influence of full-length dystrophin on brain volumes in mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy</title><published>1522443600000</published><fingerprint>5b78a78f</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bauke Kogelman, Artem Khmelinskii, Ingrid Verhaart, Laura van Vliet, Diewertje I.

Background &lt;p&gt;While links between disability and poverty are well established, there have been few longitudinal studies to clarify direction of causality, particularly among older adults in low and middle income countries. We aimed to study the effect of care dependence among older adult residents on the economic functioning of their households, in catchment area survey sites in Peru, Mexico and China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Households were classified from the evolution of the needs for care of older residents, over two previous community surveys, as ‘incident care’, ‘chronic care’ or ‘no care’, and followed up three years later to ascertain economic outcomes (household income, consumption, economic strain, satisfaction with economic circumstances, healthcare expenditure and residents giving up work or education to care).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Household income did not differ between household groups. However, income from paid work (Pooled Count Ratio pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–1.00) and government transfers (pCR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69–0.93) were lower in care households. Consumption was 12% lower in chronic care households (pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99). Household healthcare expenditure was higher (pCR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26–1.90), and catastrophic healthcare spending more common (pRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.64–2.22) in care households.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While endogeneity cannot be confidently excluded as an explanation for the findings, this study indicates that older people’s needs for care have a discernable impact on household economics, controlling for baseline indicators of long-term economic status. Although living, typically, in multigenerational family units, older people have not featured prominently in global health and development agendas. Population ageing will rapidly increase the number of households where older people live, and their societal significance. Building sustainable long-term care systems for the future will require some combination of improved income security in old age; incentivisation of informal care through compensation for direct and opportunity costs; and development of community care services to support, and, where necessary, supplement or substitute the central role of informal caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1523653200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195567</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><title>A cohort study of the effects of older adult care dependence upon household economic functioning, in Peru, Mexico and China</title><published>1523653200000</published><fingerprint>9d62ddb3</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maëlenn M.

Tubulin isotypes are known to regulate the stability and dynamics of microtubules, and are also involved in the development of resistance against microtubule-targeted cancer drugs. Indanocine, a potent microtubule depolymerizing agent, is highly active against multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells without affecting normal cells. It is known to disrupt microtubule dynamics in cells and induce apoptotic cell death. Indanocine is reported to bind to tubulin at the colchicine site i.e. at the interface of αβ tubulin heterodimer. However, it’s precise binding mode, involved molecular interactions and the binding affinities with different αβ-tubulin isotypes present in MDR cells are not well understood. Here, the binding affinities of human αβ-tubulin isotypes with indanocine were examined, employing the molecular modeling approach i.e. docking, molecular dynamics simulation and binding energy calculations. Multiple sequence analysis suggests that the amino acid sequences are different in the indanocine binding pockets of βI, βIIa, βIII and βVI isotypes. However, such differences are not observed in the amino acid sequences of βIVa, βIVb, and βV tubulin isotypes at indanocine binding pockets. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation results show that indanocine prefers the interface binding pocket of αβIIa, αβIII, αβIVb, αβV, and αβVI tubulin isotypes; whereas it is expelled from the interface binding pocket of αβIVa and αβI-tubulin isotypes. Further, binding free energy calculations show that αβVI has the highest binding affinity and αβI has the lowest binding affinity for indanocine among all β-tubulin isotypes. The binding free energy decreases in the order of αβVI &gt; αβIVb &gt; αβIIa &gt; αβIII &gt; αβV &gt; αβIVa &gt; αβI. Thus, our study provides a significant understanding of involved molecular interactions of indanocine with tubulin isotypes, which may help to design potent indanocine analogues for specific tubulin isotypes in MDR cells in future.</description><updated>1522184400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194934</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194934</canonicalUrl><title>Interaction of microtubule depolymerizing agent indanocine with different human αβ tubulin isotypes</title><published>1522184400000</published><fingerprint>6be3d66c</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bajarang Vasant Kumbhar, Dulal Panda, Ambarish Kunwar&lt;/p&gt;

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have remarkable properties: they represent the most abundant cycling cell population in the adult normal brain and they manage to achieve a uniform and constant density throughout the adult brain. This equilibrium is obtained by the interplay of four processes: division, differentiation or death, migration and active self-repulsion. They are also strongly suspected to be at the origin of gliomas, when their equilibrium is disrupted. In this article, we present a model of the dynamics of OPCs, first in a normal tissue. This model is based on a cellular automaton and its rules are mimicking the ones that regulate the dynamics of real OPCs. The model is able to reproduce the homeostasis of the cell population, with the maintenance of a constant and uniform cell density and the healing of a lesion. We show that there exists a fair quantitative agreement between the simulated and experimental parameters, such as the cell velocity, the time taken to close a lesion, and the duration of the cell cycle. We present three possible scenarios of disruption of the equilibrium: the appearance of an over-proliferating cell, of a deadless/non-differentiating cell, or of a cell that lost any contact-inhibition. We show that the appearance of an over-proliferating cell is sufficient to trigger the growth of a tumor that has low-grade glioma features: an invasive behaviour, a linear radial growth of the tumor with a corresponding growth velocity of less than 2 mm per year, as well a cell density at the center which exceeds the one in normal tissue by a factor of less than two. The loss of contact inhibition leads to a more high-grade-like glioma. The results of our model contribute to the body of evidence that identify OPCs as possible cells of origin of gliomas.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4yhFdqGpIbo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Aloys Dufour</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005977</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aloys Dufour, Emilie Gontran, Christophe Deroulers, Pascale Varlet, Johan Pallud, Basile Grammaticos, Mathilde Badoual&lt;/p&gt;
Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have remarkable properties: they represent the most abundant cycling cell population in the adult normal brain and they manage to achieve a uniform and constant density throughout the adult brain. This equilibrium is obtained by the interplay of four processes: division, differentiation or death, migration and active self-repulsion. They are also strongly suspected to be at the origin of gliomas, when their equilibrium is disrupted. In this article, we present a model of the dynamics of OPCs, first in a normal tissue. This model is based on a cellular automaton and its rules are mimicking the ones that regulate the dynamics of real OPCs. The model is able to reproduce the homeostasis of the cell population, with the maintenance of a constant and uniform cell density and the healing of a lesion. We show that there exists a fair quantitative agreement between the simulated and experimental parameters, such as the cell velocity, the time taken to close a lesion, and the duration of the cell cycle. We present three possible scenarios of disruption of the equilibrium: the appearance of an over-proliferating cell, of a deadless/non-differentiating cell, or of a cell that lost any contact-inhibition. We show that the appearance of an over-proliferating cell is sufficient to trigger the growth of a tumor that has low-grade glioma features: an invasive behaviour, a linear radial growth of the tumor with a corresponding growth velocity of less than 2 mm per year, as well a cell density at the center which exceeds the one in normal tissue by a factor of less than two. The loss of contact inhibition leads to a more high-grade-like glioma.

Hypovitaminosis D has been extensively documented in critically ill humans. However, whether or not critically ill dogs have alterations in vitamin D concentrations remains unconfirmed. The primary aims of our study were to compare serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D] concentrations in critically ill dogs with healthy control dogs, determine the prognostic utility of serum 25(OH)D concentration as a biomarker in critically ill dogs, and to assess if serum 25(OH)D concentrations in critically ill dogs are associated with length of stay in the intensive care unit or illness severity. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D together with a range of other clinical, biochemical, and hematological parameters, were measured in 99 dogs within 24 hours of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Critically ill dogs (P = 0.001) and dogs with sepsis (P = 0.002) had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy control dogs. In addition, serum 25(OH)D concentration was an independent predictor of in-hospital and 30 day survival. Using a cut-off of 33 ng/mL, serum 25(OH)D concentrations had excellent sensitivity (0.94; 95% CI, 0.71–1.00), but poor specificity (0.41; 95% CI, 0.31–0.53) for detection of survival. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLE) fast score but were not associated with ICU length of stay. Hospitalized dogs with critical illness have decreased serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy dogs and can be used to predict survival in this cohort.</description><updated>1522270800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194062</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194062</canonicalUrl><title>Serum vitamin D concentrations in hospitalized critically ill dogs</title><published>1522270800000</published><fingerprint>338237ea</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jared A.

In a search for new potential multitarget anti-HIV compounds from natural products, we have identified in &lt;i&gt;Hypericum scruglii&lt;/i&gt;, an endemic and exclusive species of Sardinia (Italy), a potent plant lead. The phytochemical study of the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from its leaves led to the isolation of its most abundant secondary metabolites, belonging to different chemical classes. In particular, three phloroglucinols derivatives were identified, confirming their significance as chemotaxonomic markers of the &lt;i&gt;Hypericum&lt;/i&gt; genus. Among them, the 3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol was reported here for the first time. All six isolated compounds have been evaluated firstly for the inhibition of both Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-associated DNA Polymerase (RDDP) and Ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities, for the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in biochemical assays, and also for their effect on viral replication. Among the isolated metabolites, three phloroglucinol derivatives and quercitrin were effective on both RT-associated RDDP and RNase H activities in biochemical assays. The same active compounds affected also HIV-1 IN strand transfer function, suggesting the involvement of the RNase H active site. Furthermore, phloroglucinols compounds, included the newly identified compound, were able to inhibit the HIV-1 replication in cell based assays.</description><updated>1522443600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195168</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195168</canonicalUrl><title>Prenylated phloroglucinols from &amp;lt;i&gt;Hypericum scruglii&amp;lt;/i&gt;, an endemic species of Sardinia (Italy), as new dual HIV-1 inhibitors effective on HIV-1 replication</title><published>1522443600000</published><fingerprint>144f49c2</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cinzia Sanna, Monica Scognamiglio, Antonio Fiorentino, Angela Corona, Vittoria Graziani, Alessia Caredda, Pierluigi Cortis, Mariofilippo Montisci, Elisa Rita Ceresola, Filippo Canducci, Ferruccio Poli, Enzo Tramontano, Francesca Esposito&lt;/p&gt;

Multivariate studies are often better suited towards non-linear network analysis than differential expression testing. Here, we present PRESTO, a &apos;PREdictive Stochastic neighbor embedding Tool for Omics&apos;, which allows unsupervised dimensionality reduction of multivariate data matrices with thousands of subjects or conditions. PRESTO is intuitively integrated into an interactive user interface that helps to visualize the multi-dimensional patterns in genome-wide transcriptomic data from basic science and clinical studies. Results: PRESTO was tested with multiple input omics&apos; platforms, including microarray and proteomics from both mouse and human clinical datasets. PRESTO can analyze up to tens of thousands of genes and shows no increase in processing time with a large number of samples or patients. In complex datasets, such as those with multiple time points, several patient groups, or diverse mouse strains, PRESTO outperformed conventional methods. Core co-expressed gene networks were intuitively grouped in clusters, or gates, after dimensionality reduction and remained consistent across users. Networks were identified and assigned to physiological and pathological functions that cannot be gleaned from conventional bioinformatics analyses. PRESTO detected gene networks from the natural variations among mouse macrophages and human blood leukocytes. We applied PRESTO to clinical transcriptomic and proteomic data from large patient cohorts and detected disease-defining signatures in antibody-mediated kidney transplant rejection, renal cell carcinoma, and relapsing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In AML, PRESTO confirmed a previously described gene signature and found a new signature of 10 genes that is highly predictive of patient outcome. Conclusions: PRESTO offers an important integration of powerful bioinformatics tools with an interactive user interface that increases data analysis accessibility beyond bioinformaticians and &apos;coders&apos;. Here, we show that PRESTO out performs conventional methods, such as DE analysis, in multi-dimensional datasets and can identify biologically relevant co-expression gene networks.

Background &lt;p&gt;Whether metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals are at increased risk of ischemic stroke is not well known. We investigated the association of the MHO phenotype with ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 354,083 adults (age 45.8 ± 14.2 years) from the Korean National Health Insurance Service–National Sample Cohort enrolled in 2004–2008 were followed-up for incident ischemic stroke until 2013. Subjects meeting none of the metabolic syndrome criteria were classified as ‘metabolically healthy’. The cohort was categorized into four groups according to obesity and metabolic status: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), MHO, and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke was newly diagnosed in 4,884 (1.4%) individuals during a mean follow-up of 7.4 ± 1.5 years. Stroke incidence rates for the MHNW, MUNW, MHO, and MUO groups were 0.56, 2.61, 0.61, and 2.76 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. While risk for stroke increased significantly in metabolically unhealthy groups, it was not increased in MHO compared to the MHNW group on multivariate analysis. In metabolically healthy individuals, obesity did not increase the risk for ischemic stroke, regardless of the severity of obesity. Meanwhile, in metabolically unhealthy individuals, being obese was significantly associated with increased risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MHO individuals were not at increased risk for ischemic stroke. However, obesity increased risk for ischemic stroke in persons with metabolic risk factors; therefore, maintaining normal weight may be more important for this population. Also, metabolic unhealthiness showed greater association than obesity with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1522443600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195210</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195210</canonicalUrl><title>Risk of ischemic stroke in metabolically healthy obesity: A nationwide population-based study</title><published>1522443600000</published><fingerprint>10bf2e49</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyun-Jung Lee, Eue-Keun Choi, Seung-Hwan Lee, Yong-Jin Kim, Kyung-Do Han, Seil Oh&lt;/p&gt;

The big data from MS machines has led to the development of novel serial and parallel algorithmic tools. However, the absence of data benchmarks and ground truth makes the algorithmic integrity testing and reproducibility a challenging problem. To this end, we present MaSS-Simulator, which is an easy to use simulator and can be configured to generate MS/MS datasets for a wide variety of conditions with known ground truths. MaSS-Simulator offers a large number of configuration options to simulate control datasets with desired properties thus enabling rigorous and large scale algorithmic testing. We assessed 8,031 spectra generated by MaSS-Simulator by comparing them against the experimentally generated spectra of same peptides.

[NEW RESULTS]</title><published>1524034800000</published><fingerprint>e6050c6</fingerprint><content><content>Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has become an essential tool in the study of proteins. The big data from MS machines has led to the development of novel serial and parallel algorithmic tools. However, the absence of data benchmarks and ground truth makes the algorithmic integrity testing and reproducibility a challenging problem. To this end, we present MaSS-Simulator, which is an easy to use simulator and can be configured to generate MS/MS datasets for a wide variety of conditions with known ground truths. MaSS-Simulator offers a large number of configuration options to simulate control datasets with desired properties thus enabling rigorous and large scale algorithmic testing. We assessed 8,031 spectra generated by MaSS-Simulator by comparing them against the experimentally generated spectra of same peptides. Our results showed that MaSS-Simulator generated spectra were very close to the real-experimental spectra and had a relative-error distribution centered around 25%. In contrast the theoretical spectra for same peptides had relative-error distribution centered around 150%.

Lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes (DM2) prevention implementation studies can be effective and lasting. Long-term weight loss maintenance enhances the intervention effect through a significant decrease in diabetes incidence over time. Our objective was to identify factors predicting long-term successful weight reduction maintenance achieved during a DM2 prevention program in patients with high DM2 risk in primary health care. Study participants (n = 263), middle-aged, slightly obese with baseline increased DM2 risk (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC)&gt;14), but no diabetes were invited to receive 11 lifestyle counselling sessions, guided physical activity sessions and motivational support during 10-months. The study participants had three clinical examinations during the study (baseline, one and three years). Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of weight reduction maintenance two years after the discontinuation of the intervention. Out of 105 patients who completed all three examinations (baseline age 56.6 (standard deviation (SD) = 10.7), body mass index 31.1 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (SD = 4.9), FINDRISC 18.6 (SD = 3.1)), 73 patients (70%) showed weight loss during the intervention (mean weight loss 4.2 kg, SD = 5.1). The total weight loss achieved in the maintainers (27 of 73 study participants) two years after the intervention had finished was 6.54 kg (4.47 kg+2.0 kg). The non-maintainers, on the other hand, returned to their initial weight at the start of the intervention (+0.21 kg). In multivariable analysis baseline history of increased glucose (odds ratio (OR) = 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–13.6) and reduction of total fat in diet during follow-up (OR = 4.3; 95% CI 1.5–12.2) were independent predictors of successful weight loss. Further studies exploring predictors of weight loss maintenance in diabetes prevention are needed to help health care providers to redesign interventions and improve long-term outcomes of real life interventions.</description><updated>1521838800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194589</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194589</canonicalUrl><title>Predictors of long term weight loss maintenance in patients at high risk of type 2 diabetes participating in a lifestyle intervention program in primary health care: The DE-PLAN study</title><published>1521838800000</published><fingerprint>a15c8eea</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska, Noël C.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to examine the incidence of the oculocardiac reflex during a non-invasive intracranial pressure measurement when gradual external pressure was applied to the orbital tissues and eye.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients (n = 101) and healthy volunteers (n = 56) aged 20–75 years who underwent a non-invasive intracranial pressure measurement were included in this retrospective oculocardiac reflex analysis.

Transgenic rat models of Alzheimer’s disease were used to examine differences in memory and brain histology. Double transgenic female rats (APP+PS1) over-expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) and single transgenic rats (APP21) over-expressing human APP were compared with wild type Fischer rats (WT). The Barnes maze assessed learning and memory and showed that both APP21 and APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors than the WT rats during the acquisition phase, signifying slower learning. Additionally, the APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors following a retention interval, indicating impaired memory compared to both the APP21 and WT rats. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody against amyloid-β (Aβ) showed extensive and mostly diffuse Aβ plaques in the hippocampus and dense plaques that contained tau in the cortex of the brains of the APP+PS1 rats. Furthermore, the APP+PS1 rats also showed vascular changes, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy with extensive Aβ deposits in cortical and leptomeningeal blood vessel walls and venous collagenosis. In addition to the Aβ accumulation observed in arterial, venous, and capillary walls, APP+PS1 rats also displayed enlarged blood vessels and perivascular space. Overall, the brain histopathology and behavioral assessment showed that the APP+PS1 rats demonstrated behavioral characteristics and vascular changes similar to those commonly observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</description><updated>1523480400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195469</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195469</canonicalUrl><title>Memory deficiency, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and amyloid-β plaques in APP+PS1 double transgenic rat model of Alzheimer’s disease</title><published>1523480400000</published><fingerprint>82314836</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Klakotskaia, Cansu Agca, Rachel A.

Fungal communities in agricultural soils are assumed to be affected by soil and crop management. Our intention was to investigate the impact of different tillage and fertilization practices on fungal communities in a long-term crop rotation field trial established in 1992 in Central Germany. Two winter wheat fields in replicated strip-tillage design, comprising conventional &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. conservation tillage, intensive &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. extensive fertilization and different pre-crops (maize &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. rapeseed) were analyzed by a metabarcoding approach applying Illumina paired-end sequencing of amplicons generated by two recently developed primer pairs targeting the two fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2). Analysis of 5.1 million high-quality sequence reads uncovered a diverse fungal community in the two fields, composed of 296 fungal genera including 3,398 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at the 97% sequence similarity threshold. Both primer pairs detected the same fungal phyla (&lt;i&gt;Basidio&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Asco&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Zygo&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Glomero&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Chytridiomycota&lt;/i&gt;), but in different relative abundances. OTU richness was higher in the ITS1 dataset, while ITS2 data were more diverse and of higher evenness. Effects of farming practice on fungal community structures were revealed. Almost two-thirds of the fungal genera were represented in all different soil treatments, whereas the remaining genera clearly responded to farming practice. Principal Component Analysis revealed four distinct clusters according to tillage practice and pre-crop. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) substantiated the results and proved significant influences of tillage and pre-crop, while fertilization had the smallest and non-significant effect. In-depth analysis of putative phytopathogenic and plant beneficial fungal groups indicated distinct responses; for example &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; was significantly enriched in the intensively fertilized conservation tillage variants with the pre-crop maize, while &lt;i&gt;Phoma&lt;/i&gt; displayed significant association with conventional tillage and pre-crop rapeseed. Many putative plant beneficial fungi also reacted differentially to farming practice with the most distinct responders identified among the &lt;i&gt;Glomeromycota&lt;/i&gt; (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF).</description><updated>1522962000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195345</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195345</canonicalUrl><title>Fungal community profiles in agricultural soils of a long-term field trial under different tillage, fertilization and crop rotation conditions analyzed by high-throughput ITS-amplicon sequencing</title><published>1522962000000</published><fingerprint>66fa4f09</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Loreen Sommermann, Joerg Geistlinger, Daniel Wibberg, Annette Deubel, Jessica Zwanzig, Doreen Babin, Andreas Schlüter, Ingo Schellenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Many putative plant beneficial fungi also reacted differentially to farming practice with the most distinct responders identified among the &lt;i&gt;Glomeromycota&lt;/i&gt; (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Loreen Sommermann</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195345</link></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b924a6a3:c62b9a:34f43e70</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24182-9</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Disturbance Regimes Drive The Diversity of Regional Floristic Pools Across Guianan Rainforest Landscapes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Disturbance Regimes Drive The Diversity of Regional Floristic Pools Across Guianan Rainforest Landscapes, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24182-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24182-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Disturbance Regimes Drive The Diversity of Regional Floristic Pools Across Guianan Rainforest Landscapes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/wzhtJ9uMh8g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24182-9</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/wzhtJ9uMh8g/s41598-018-24182-9</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523524609699</crawled><title>Author Correction: Disturbance Regimes Drive The Diversity of Regional Floristic Pools Across Guianan Rainforest Landscapes</title><published>1523516400000</published><fingerprint>c316a73</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Disturbance Regimes Drive The Diversity of Regional Floristic Pools Across Guianan Rainforest Landscapes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Disturbance Regimes Drive The Diversity of Regional Floristic Pools Across Guianan Rainforest Landscapes, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24182-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24182-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Disturbance Regimes Drive The Diversity of Regional Floristic Pools Across Guianan Rainforest Landscapes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/wzhtJ9uMh8g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Stéphane Guitet</name></author><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24182-9</link><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4602:34f43e70</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195197</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel J.

The assessment of competitive movement demands in team sports has traditionally relied upon global positioning system (GPS) analyses presented as fixed-time epochs (e.g., 5–40 min). More recently, presenting game data as a rolling average has become prevalent due to concerns over a loss of sampling resolution associated with the windowing of data over fixed periods. Accordingly, this study compared rolling average (ROLL) and fixed-time (FIXED) epochs for quantifying the peak movement demands of international rugby union match-play as a function of playing position. Elite players from three different squads (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 119) were monitored using 10 Hz GPS during 36 matches played in the 2014–2017 seasons. Players categorised broadly as forwards and backs, and then by positional sub-group (FR: front row, SR: second row, BR: back row, HB: half back, MF: midfield, B3: back three) were monitored during match-play for peak values of high-speed running (&gt;5 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; HSR) and relative distance covered (m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) over 60–300 s using two types of sample-epoch (ROLL, FIXED). Irrespective of the method used, as the epoch length increased, values for the intensity of running actions decreased (e.g., For the backs using the ROLL method, distance covered decreased from 177.4 ± 20.6 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the 60 s epoch to 107.5 ± 13.3 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for the 300 s epoch). For the team as a whole, and irrespective of position, estimates of fixed effects indicated significant between-method differences across all time-points for both relative distance covered and HSR. Movement demands were underestimated consistently by FIXED versus ROLL with differences being most pronounced using 60 s epochs (95% CI HSR: -6.05 to -4.70 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 95% CI distance: -18.45 to -16.43 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). For all HSR time epochs except one, all backs groups increased more (p &amp;lt; 0.01) from FIXED to ROLL than the forward groups. Linear mixed modelling of ROLL data highlighted that for HSR (except 60 s epoch), SR was the only group not significantly different to FR. For relative distance covered all other position groups were greater than the FR (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The FIXED method underestimated both relative distance (~11%) and HSR values (up to ~20%) compared to the ROLL method. These differences were exaggerated for the HSR variable in the backs position who covered the greatest HSR distance; highlighting important consideration for those implementing the FIXED method of analysis. The data provides coaches with a worst-case scenario reference on the running demands required for periods of 60–300 s in length. This information offers novel insight into game demands and can be used to inform the design of training games to increase specificity of preparation for the most demanding phases of matches.</description><updated>1522962000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195197</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195197</canonicalUrl><title>Assessing worst case scenarios in movement demands derived from global positioning systems during international rugby union matches: Rolling averages versus fixed length epochs</title><published>1522962000000</published><fingerprint>12889cec</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel J.

Antimicrobials are used in animal agriculture to cure bacterial infectious diseases. However, antimicrobial use (AMU) inevitably leads to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially infecting humans. As a global public threat, antimicrobial resistance has led policy makers to implement regulations supervising AMU. The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production.</description><updated>1521752400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</canonicalUrl><title>The farm cost of decreasing antimicrobial use in dairy production</title><published>1521752400000</published><fingerprint>97dca45</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Lhermie, Loren William Tauer, Yrjo Tapio Gröhn&lt;/p&gt;

The origin of the machinery that realizes protein biosynthesis in all organisms is still unclear. One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states. The one unifying aspect of both classes is their function of binding ATP. We identified Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers as most compact ATP binding motifs characteristic for each Class. Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures. Regarding the origin of aaRS, the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis states that the peculiar nature of the two aaRS classes is the result of their primordial forms, called Protozymes, being encoded on opposite strands of the same gene. Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes. Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZqNwxiUByA0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006101</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ZqNwxiUByA0/article</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523900893385</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers delineate Class I and Class II aminoacyl tRNA synthetases</title><published>1523912400000</published><fingerprint>545f066f</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Kaiser, Sebastian Bittrich, Sebastian Salentin, Christoph Leberecht, V.

Mounting evidence suggests that glycans, rather than merely serving as a “shield”, contribute critically to antigenicity of the HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein, representing critical antigenic determinants for many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). While many studies have focused on defining the role of individual glycans or groups of proximal glycans in bNAb binding, little is known about the effects of changes in the overall glycan landscape in modulating antibody access and Env antigenicity. Here we developed a systems glycobiology approach to reverse engineer the complexity of HIV glycan heterogeneity to guide antigenicity-based &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; glycoprotein design. bNAb binding was assessed against a panel of 94 recombinant gp120 monomers exhibiting defined glycan site occupancies. Using a Bayesian machine learning algorithm, bNAb-specific glycan footprints were identified and used to design antigens that selectively alter bNAb antigenicity as a proof-of concept. Our approach provides a new design strategy to predictively modulate antigenicity via the alteration of glycan topography, thereby focusing the humoral immune response on sites of viral vulnerability for HIV.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XbpST9Ne8uU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Wen-Han Yu</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006093</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Han Yu, Peng Zhao, Monia Draghi, Claudia Arevalo, Christina B.

Tristan da Cunha Islands, an archipelago of four rocky volcanic islands situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and part of the United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), present a rare example of a relatively unimpacted temperate marine ecosystem. We conducted the first quantitative surveys of nearshore kelp forests, offshore pelagic waters and deep sea habitats. Kelp forests had very low biodiversity and species richness, but high biomass and abundance of those species present. Spatial variation in assemblage structure for both nearshore fish and invertebrates/algae was greatest between the three northern islands and the southern island of Gough, where sea temperatures were on average 3-4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; colder. Despite a lobster fishery that provides the bulk of the income to the Tristan islands, lobster abundance and biomass are comparable to or greater than many Marine Protected Areas in other parts of the world. Pelagic camera surveys documented a rich biodiversity offshore, including large numbers of juvenile blue sharks, &lt;i&gt;Prionace glauca&lt;/i&gt;. Species richness and abundance in the deep sea is positively related to hard rocky substrate and biogenic habitats such as sea pens, crinoids, whip corals, and gorgonians were present at 40% of the deep camera deployments. We observed distinct differences in the deep fish community above and below ~750 m depth. Concurrent oceanographic sampling showed a discontinuity in temperature and salinity at this depth. While currently healthy, Tristan’s marine ecosystem is not without potential threats: shipping traffic leading to wrecks and species introductions, pressure to increase fishing effort beyond sustainable levels and the impacts of climate change all could potentially increase in the coming years. The United Kingdom has committed to protection of marine environments across the UKOTs, including Tristan da Cunha and these results can be used to inform future management decisions as well as provide a baseline against which future monitoring can be based.</description><updated>1522357200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195167</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><title>First quantification of subtidal community structure at Tristan da Cunha Islands in the remote South Atlantic: from kelp forests to the deep sea</title><published>1522357200000</published><fingerprint>505b6b33</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer E.

&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most important plant pathogens in the world, causing root rot in more than a thousand plant species. This observational study was carried out on a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; infected heathland of &lt;i&gt;Erica umbellata&lt;/i&gt; used as goat pasture. The patterns and shapes of disease foci and their distribution were described in a spatial and temporal context using an aerial photograph record. A set of topographic traits was selected on the basis of a disease dynamic hypothesis and their effects on observed spatial disease patterns were analyzed. Incipient infections situated in flat terrain expanded as compact circular front patterns with a low growth rate. On slopes, disease patches developed more rapidly down slope, forming parabolic shapes. The axis direction of the parabolas was highly correlated with terrain aspect, while the parabolic amplitude was associated with land curvature and slope. New secondary foci appeared over the years producing an accelerated increase of the affected surface. These new foci were observed in sites where disease density was higher or near sites more frequently visited by animals such as the stable or the forage crop. In contrast, a smaller number of disease foci occur in areas which animals are reluctant to visit, such as where they have a short range of vision. Our results suggest that 1) the growth of existing &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; foci is controlled by a combination of root-to-root contact and water flows, 2) the increase in the diseased area arises mainly from the multiplication of patches, 3) the formation of new foci is mediated by long-distance transport due to the movement of animals and humans along certain preferential pathways, and 4) geomorphology and topography traits are associated with the epidemiology of this soil-borne pathogen.</description><updated>1522443600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195060</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195060</canonicalUrl><title>Topographic effects on dispersal patterns of &amp;lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&amp;lt;/i&gt; at a stand scale in a Spanish heathland</title><published>1522443600000</published><fingerprint>7f82b0f</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Enrique Cardillo, Angel Acedo, Enrique Abad&lt;/p&gt;

Increased production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their widespread application in industrial and consumer products have led to a rise in the release of CNTs into the aquatic environment. CNTs have a very strong adsorption affinity for various environmental contaminants; therefore, they may also influence the toxic effects of other pollutants, such as toxic metals. In this study, the effect of two different functionalized carbon nanotubes, carboxylate and polyethyleneimine modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (C-MWCNTs and N-MWCNT, respectively) on lead toxicity and bioaccumulation was investigated with a freshwater zooplankton &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt;. The acute toxicity results indicate that the different surface properties of the two types of MWCNTs have different effects on lead toxicity to &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;magna&lt;/i&gt;. The negatively charged C-MWCNT showed a notable decrease in lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.08 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; C-MWCNT), whereas the positively charged N-MWCNT had only a slight effect on lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 0.16 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; N-MWCNT). The decrease of lead toxicity was related with the reduced bioavailability of free metal form (Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) caused by greater adsorption of lead onto the MWCNTs. The present study suggests that there is a need to consider carefully the complex interaction of CNTs with toxic metals in future ecotoxicological studies.</description><updated>1522357200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194935</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194935</canonicalUrl><title>Effects of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes on toxicity and bioaccumulation of lead in &amp;lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><published>1522357200000</published><fingerprint>d544b27b</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Min-Hee Jang, Yu Sik Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

The human gut microbiome contributes to a broad range of biochemical and metabolic functions that directly or indirectly affect human physiology. Several recent studies have indicated that factors like age, geographical location, genetic makeup, and individual health status significantly influence the diversity, stability, and resilience of the gut microbiome. Of the mentioned factors, geographical location (and related dietary/socio-economic context) appears to explain a significant portion of microbiome variation observed in various previously conducted base-line studies on human gut microbiome. Given this context, we have undertaken a microbiome study with the objective of cataloguing the taxonomic diversity of gut microbiomes sampled from an urban cohort from Ahmedabad city in Western India. Computational analysis of microbiome sequence data corresponding to 160 stool samples (collected from 80 healthy individuals at two time-points, 60 days apart) has indicated a &lt;i&gt;Prevotella&lt;/i&gt;-dominated microbial community. Given that the typical diet of participants included carbohydrate and fibre-rich components (predominantly whole grains and legume-based preparations), results appear to validate the proposed correlation between diet/geography and microbiome composition. Comparative analysis of obtained gut microbiome profiles with previously published microbiome profiles from US, China, Finland, and Japan additionally reveals a distinct taxonomic and (inferred) functional niche for the sampled microbiomes.</description><updated>1523048400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195643</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195643</canonicalUrl><title>A snapshot of gut microbiota of an adult urban population from Western region of India</title><published>1523048400000</published><fingerprint>5aaf8c7b</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Disha Tandon, Mohammed Monzoorul Haque, Saravanan R., Shafiq Shaikh, Sriram P., Ashok Kumar Dubey, Sharmila S.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Azathioprine is a widely used immunosuppressive drug. Genetic polymorphisms and activity of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) have been associated with azathioprine efficacy and toxicity in several populations. We investigated whether these associations also exist for ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) patients, who receive azathioprine maintenance therapy after remission induction with cyclophosphamide.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;207 AAV patients treated with cyclophosphamide induction and azathioprine maintenance therapy were included and followed for 60 months. &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype and tertiles of TPMT activity were compared to relapse free survival and occurrence of adverse events, particularly leukopenia. Multivariable regression was performed to account for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In univariable analysis, relapse free survival was not significantly associated with &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype (P = 0.41) or TPMT activity (P = 0.07), although it tended to be longer in lower tertiles of TPMT activity. There was no significant association of TPMT genotype and activity with occurrence of any adverse event. In multiple regression, leukocyte counts at the end of cyclophosphamide induction were related to risk of leukopenia during azathioprine therapy [P&amp;lt;0.001; OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.43–0.68)] and risk of relapse during follow-up [P = 0.001; HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.07–1.29)] irrespective of TMPT genotype or activity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;TPMT genotype and activity were not independent predictors of relapse, and could not predict leukopenia or other adverse effects from azathioprine. Leukocyte counts after cyclophosphamide induction were related to both outcomes, implying a greater influence of cyclophosphamide response compared to azathioprine and TPMT in AAV patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1523307600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195524</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195524</canonicalUrl><title>Thiopurine methyltransferase genotype and activity cannot predict outcomes of azathioprine maintenance therapy for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis: A retrospective cohort study</title><published>1523307600000</published><fingerprint>d5573a20</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arno C.

Cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet), an oral calcimimetic agent has been widely used for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In sharp contrast to vitamin D receptor activators, cinacalcet suppresses SHPT without inducing hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia. Nevertheless, some patients remain refractory to SHPT with this agent, as the dose cannot be sufficiently increased due to gastrointestinal symptoms. In order to resolve this issue, we have developed a newly synthesized calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580). In a rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy, oral administration of evocalcet efficiently suppressed the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). With regard to the gastro-intestinal effects, cinacalcet induced a significant delay in gastric emptying in rats, while evocalcet did no marked effects on it. Evocalcet also demonstrated the less induction of emesis compared to cinacalcet in common marmosets. The pharmacological effects of evocalcet were observed at lower doses because of its higher bioavailability than cinacalcet, which may have contributed to the reduced GI tract symptoms. In addition, evocalcet showed no substantial direct inhibition of any CYP isozymes in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; liver microsome assay, suggesting a better profile in drug interactions than cinacalcet that inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. These findings suggest that evocalcet can be a better alternative to cinacalcet, an oral calcimimetic agent, with a wider safety margin.</description><updated>1522789200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195316</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195316</canonicalUrl><title>A novel calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580), suppresses the parathyroid cell function with little effect on the gastrointestinal tract or CYP isozymes &amp;lt;i&gt;in vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><published>1522789200000</published><fingerprint>6e5b4f3</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takehisa Kawata, Shin Tokunaga, Miki Murai, Nami Masuda, Waka Haruyama, Youji Shoukei, Yutaka Hisada, Tetsuya Yanagida, Hiroshi Miyazaki, Michihito Wada, Tadao Akizawa, Masafumi Fukagawa&lt;/p&gt;

These findings suggest that evocalcet can be a better alternative to cinacalcet, an oral calcimimetic agent, with a wider safety margin.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Takehisa Kawata</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195316</link></item><item><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b67:7c9981b6</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023281?af=R</originId><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023281?af=R</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><title>Solitonic natural orbitals</title><published>1522988918000</published><fingerprint>4b1147ec</fingerprint><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Jerzy Cioslowski</name></author><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023281?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162ac9be789:18d9190:9aea0a7d</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/297754v1?rss=1</originId><description>Motivation: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods applied to bacterial genomes have shown promising results for genetic marker discovery or fine-assessment of marker effect. Recently, alignment-free methods based on kmer composition have proven their ability to explore the accessory genome. However, they lead to redundant descriptions and results which are hard to interpret. Methods: Here, we introduce DBGWAS, an extended kmer-based GWAS method producing interpretable genetic variants associated with phenotypes. Relying on compacted De Bruijn graphs (cDBG), our method gathers cDBG nodes identified by the association model into subgraphs defined from their neighbourhood in the initial cDBG. DBGWAS is fast, alignment-free and only requires a set of contigs and phenotypes. It produces annotated subgraphs representing local polymorphisms as well as mobile genetic elements (MGE) and offers a graphical framework to interpret GWAS results. Results: We validated our method using antibiotic resistance phenotypes for three bacterial species. DBGWAS recovered known resistance determinants such as mutations in core genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and genes acquired by horizontal transfer in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - along with their MGE context. It also enabled us to formulate new hypotheses involving genetic variants not yet described in the antibiotic resistance literature. Conclusion: Our novel method proved its efficiency to retrieve any type of phenotype-associated genetic variant without prior knowledge. All experiments were computed in less than two hours and reported a compact set of meaningful subgraphs, thereby outperforming other GWAS approaches and facilitating the interpretation of the results.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Current diagnostic assessment tools remain suboptimal in demonstrating complex morphology of congenital heart disease (CHD). This limitation has posed several challenges in preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education. This study aims to investigate the dimensional accuracy and the clinical value of 3D printed model of CHD in the above three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data, a patient-specific 3D model of a 20-month-old boy with double outlet right ventricle was printed in Tango Plus material. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlation of the quantitative measurements taken at analogous anatomical locations between the CCTA images pre- and post-3D printing. Qualitative analysis was conducted by distributing surveys to six health professionals (two radiologists, two cardiologists and two cardiac surgeons) and three medical academics to assess the clinical value of the 3D printed model in these three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Excellent correlation (r = 0.99) was noted in the measurements between CCTA and 3D printed model, with a mean difference of 0.23 mm. Four out of six health professionals found the model to be useful in facilitating preoperative planning, while all of them thought that the model would be invaluable in enhancing patient-doctor communication. All three medical academics found the model to be helpful in teaching, and thought that the students will be able to learn the pathology quicker with better understanding.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The complex cardiac anatomy can be accurately replicated in flexible material using 3D printing technology. 3D printed heart models could serve as an excellent tool in facilitating preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education, although further studies with inclusion of more clinical cases are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1521666000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</canonicalUrl><title>Clinical value of patient-specific three-dimensional printing of congenital heart disease: Quantitative and qualitative assessments</title><published>1521666000000</published><fingerprint>2e27b850</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Wen Wen Lau, Dongting Liu, Lei Xu, Zhanming Fan, Zhonghua Sun&lt;/p&gt;

All three medical academics found the model to be helpful in teaching, and thought that the students will be able to learn the pathology quicker with better understanding.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The complex cardiac anatomy can be accurately replicated in flexible material using 3D printing technology. 3D printed heart models could serve as an excellent tool in facilitating preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education, although further studies with inclusion of more clinical cases are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Ivan Wen Wen Lau</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</link></item><item><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88f4:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021407?af=R</originId><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021407?af=R</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><title>NH3 adsorption on anatase-TiO2(101)</title><published>1521777529000</published><fingerprint>707b2c65</fingerprint><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Stig Koust</name></author><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021407?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a529828:34f43e70</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/111?rss=1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;The Eneolithic Botai culture of the Central Asian steppes provides the earliest archaeological evidence for horse husbandry, ~5500 years ago, but the exact nature of early horse domestication remains controversial.

Discovery of copy number variations (CNVs), a major category of structural variations, have dramatically changed our understanding of differences between individuals and provide an alternate paradigm for the genetic basis of human diseases. CNVs include both copy gain and copy loss events and their detection genome-wide is now possible using high-throughput, low-cost next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. However, accurate detection of CNVs from NGS data is not straightforward due to non-uniform coverage of reads resulting from various systemic biases. We have developed an integrated platform, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV, to handle some of these issues in CNV detection in whole genome NGS data. It has a modular framework comprising five major modules: data pre-treatment, segmentation, variant calling, annotation and visualization. An important feature of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV is the functional annotation module that enables the user to identify and prioritize CNVs encompassing various functional elements, genomic features and disease-associations. Parallelization of the segmentation algorithms makes the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV platform even accessible on a desktop. Here we show the effect of sequencing coverage, read length, bin size, data pre-treatment and segmentation approaches on accurate detection of the complete spectrum of CNVs. Performance of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV is evaluated on both simulated data and real data for different sequencing depths.

The structure and function of clinical dosage insulin and its analogues were assessed. This included ‘native insulins’ (human recombinant, bovine, porcine), ‘fast-acting analogues’ (aspart, glulisine, lispro) and ‘slow-acting analogues’ (glargine, detemir, degludec). Analytical ultracentrifugation, both sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments, were employed to yield distributions of both molar mass and sedimentation coefficient of all nine insulins. Size exclusion chromatography, coupled to multi-angle light scattering, was also used to explore the function of these analogues. On ultracentrifugation analysis, the insulins under investigation were found to be in numerous conformational states, however the majority of insulins were present in a primarily hexameric conformation. This was true for all native insulins and two fast-acting analogues. However, glargine was present as a dimer, detemir was a multi-hexameric system, degludec was a dodecamer (di-hexamer) and glulisine was present as a dimer-hexamer-dihexamer system. However, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the two hexameric fast-acting analogues (aspart and lispro) dissociated into monomers and dimers due to the lack of zinc in the mobile phase. This comprehensive study is the first time all nine insulins have been characterised in this way, the first time that insulin detemir have been studied using analytical ultracentrifugation and the first time that insulins aspart and glulisine have been studied using sedimentation equilibrium. The structure and function of these clinically administered insulins is of critical importance and this research adds novel data to an otherwise complex functional physiological protein.</description><updated>1522357200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195010</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195010</canonicalUrl><title>Characterisation of insulin analogues therapeutically available to patients</title><published>1522357200000</published><fingerprint>72e2dd6e</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gary G.

Background &lt;p&gt;Atypical meningiomas are common central nervous system neoplasms with high recurrence rate and poorer prognosis compared to their grade I counterparts. Surgical excision and radiotherapy remains the mainstay therapy but medical treatments are limited. We explore new drug candidates using computational drug repurposing based on the gene expression signature of atypical meningioma tissue with subsequent analysis of drug-generated expression profiles. We further explore possible mechanisms of action for the identified drug candidates using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We extracted gene expression profiles for atypical meningiomas (12 samples) and normal meningeal tissue (4 samples) from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which were then used to generate a gene signature comprising of 281 differentially expressed genes. Drug candidates were explored using both the Board Institute Connectivity Map (cmap) and Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). Functional analysis of significant differential gene expression for drug candidates was performed with IPA.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using our integrated approach, we identified multiple, already licensed, drug candidates such as emetine, verteporfin, phenoxybenzamine and trazodone. Analysis with IPA revealed that these drugs target signal cascades potentially relevant in pathogenesis of meningiomas, particular examples are the effect on ERK by trazodone, MAP kinases by emetine, and YAP-1 protein by verteporfin.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Gene expression profiling and use of drug expression profiles have yielded several plausible drug candidates for treating atypical meningioma, some of which have already been suggested by preceding studies. Although our analyses suggested multiple anti-tumour mechanisms for these drugs, further &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies are required for validation.&lt;/p&gt; Importance of the study &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge this is the first study which combines relatively new, yet established computational techniques to identify additional treatments for a difficult to manage cerebral neoplasm.

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Mehdi Bouhaddou</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005985</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Bouhaddou, Anne Marie Barrette, Alan D.

&lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; is the most speciose genus of the order Cingulata, including approximately 40% of known living armadillos. Nine species are currently recognized, although comprehensive analyses of the entire genus have never been done. Our aim is to revise the taxonomy of the long-nosed armadillos and properly define the taxa. We examined 2126 specimens of &lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; preserved in 39 different museum collections, including 17 type specimens. Three complementary methods were applied to explore morphological datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative morphological variation in discrete characters was assessed by direct observations of specimens. Linear morphometric variation was based on external data and cranial measurements of 887 adult skulls. The shape and size of the skull was abstracted through two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of dorsal, lateral and ventral views of respectively 421, 211, and 220 adult specimens. Our results converge on the recognition of eight living species (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;beniensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kappleri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mazzai&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;novemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pastasae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pilosus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sabanicola&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;), and three subspecies of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hybridus&lt;/i&gt;, and a new subspecies from Cordoba described here).

Past and recent attempts at devising objective biomarkers for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid have focused on abundance measures of time-dependent proteins. Similar independent determinants would be most welcome in diagnosing the most common form of TBI, mild TBI (mTBI), which remains difficult to define and confirm based solely on clinical criteria. There are currently no consensus diagnostic measures that objectively define individuals as having sustained an acute mTBI. Plasma metabolomic analyses have recently evolved to offer an alternative to proteomic analyses, offering an orthogonal diagnostic measure to what is currently available. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a developed set of metabolomic biomarkers is able to objectively classify college athletes sustaining mTBI from non-injured teammates, within 6 hours of trauma and whether such a biomarker panel could be effectively applied to an independent cohort of TBI and control subjects.
A 6-metabolite panel was developed from biomarkers that had their identities confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in our Athlete cohort. These biomarkers were defined at ≤6 hours following mTBI and objectively classified mTBI athletes from teammate controls, and provided similar classification of these groups at the 2, 3, and 7 days post-mTBI. The same 6-metabolite panel, when applied to a separate, independent cohort provided statistically similar results despite major differences between the two cohorts. Our confirmed plasma biomarker panel objectively classifies acute mTBI cases from controls within 6 hours of injury in our two independent cohorts. While encouraged by our initial results, we expect future studies to expand on these initial observations.</description><updated>1524258000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195318</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195318</canonicalUrl><title>Plasma metabolomic biomarkers accurately classify acute mild traumatic brain injury from controls</title><published>1524258000000</published><fingerprint>b26b5f5c</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Massimo S.

From whole organisms to individual cells, responses to environmental conditions are influenced by genetic makeup, where the effect of genetic variation on a trait depends on the environmental context. RNA-sequencing quantifies gene expression as a molecular trait, and is capable of capturing both genetic and environmental effects. In this study, we explore opportunities of using allele-specific expression (ASE) to discover &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting genotype-environment interactions (GxE)—genetic effects on gene expression that depend on an environmental condition. Treating 17 common, clinical traits as approximations of the cellular environment of 267 skeletal muscle biopsies, we identify 10 candidate environmental response expression quantitative trait loci (reQTLs) across 6 traits (12 unique gene-environment trait pairs; 10% FDR per trait) including sex, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although using ASE is in principle a promising approach to detect GxE effects, replication of such signals can be challenging as validation requires harmonization of environmental traits across cohorts and a sufficient sampling of heterozygotes for a transcribed SNP. Comprehensive discovery and replication will require large human transcriptome datasets, or the integration of multiple transcribed SNPs, coupled with standardized clinical phenotyping.</description><updated>1523912400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195788</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195788</canonicalUrl><title>Interactions between genetic variation and cellular environment in skeletal muscle gene expression</title><published>1523912400000</published><fingerprint>278c3df4</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by D.

Ascorbic acid (AsA), chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and their associated gene expression patterns were analysed in &lt;i&gt;Actinidia chinensis&lt;/i&gt; ‘Hongyang’ outer pericarp. The results showed chlorophyll degradation during fruit development and softening, exposed the yellow carotenoid pigments. &lt;i&gt;LHCB1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CLS1&lt;/i&gt; gene expressions were decreased, while &lt;i&gt;PPH2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPH3&lt;/i&gt; gene expressions were increased, indicating that downregulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis and upregulation of its degradation, caused chlorophyll degradation.

The aim of this study was to analyze the position of the lumbopelvic region and the muscle activation of erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles in a group of pregnant women in the third trimester. The hypothesis was that pregnancy-related biomechanical and morphological changes modify the position of the lumbopelvic region and the activation of extensor muscles. The position of the lumbar spine and pelvis in the sagittal plane, and the EMG activity of the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles, were recorded during standing in 34 nulliparous and 34 pregnant women in the third trimester, and also two months after birth in the group of pregnant women. No significant differences in the position of the lumbar spine or pelvis between the group of pregnant women and nulliparous or postpartum were observed. A significant increase was observed in the EMG activity of the erector spinae (4.6% vs 2.4% and 2.1% in the nulliparous group and postpartum respectively) and the biceps femoris (3.4% vs 1.2% and 1.4%) in pregnant women compared to the other two groups (p &amp;lt;0.01). We conclude that pregnant women in the third trimester show no alterations in lumbopelvic position compared to nulliparous and postpartum women. However, there is an increase of the EMG activity of the trunk extensors. These results indicate that the extensor muscles of the trunk show, in static positions, adaptive responses to the increase of anterior loads during pregnancy.</description><updated>1522184400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194853</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194853</canonicalUrl><title>Changes in trunk posture and muscle responses in standing during pregnancy and postpartum</title><published>1522184400000</published><fingerprint>3af0ee32</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gemma Biviá-Roig, Juan Francisco Lisón, Daniel Sánchez-Zuriaga&lt;/p&gt;

Local and spontaneous calcium signals play important roles in neurons and neuronal networks. Spontaneous or cell-autonomous calcium signals may be difficult to assess because they appear in an unpredictable spatiotemporal pattern and in very small neuronal loci of axons or dendrites. We developed an open source bioinformatics tool for an unbiased assessment of calcium signals in x,y-t imaging series. The tool bases its algorithm on a continuous wavelet transform-guided peak detection to identify calcium signal candidates. The highly sensitive calcium event definition is based on identification of peaks in 1D data through analysis of a 2D wavelet transform surface. For spatial analysis, the tool uses a grid to separate the x,y-image field in independently analyzed grid windows. A document containing a graphical summary of the data is automatically created and displays the loci of activity for a wide range of signal intensities. Furthermore, the number of activity events is summed up to create an estimated total activity value, which can be used to compare different experimental situations, such as calcium activity before or after an experimental treatment. All traces and data of active loci become documented. The tool can also compute the signal variance in a sliding window to visualize activity-dependent signal fluctuations. We applied the calcium signal detector to monitor activity states of cultured mouse neurons. Our data show that both the total activity value and the variance area created by a sliding window can distinguish experimental manipulations of neuronal activity states. Notably, the tool is powerful enough to compute local calcium events and ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in small loci of distal neurites of neurons, which remain during pharmacological blockade of neuronal activity with inhibitors such as tetrodotoxin, to block action potential firing, or inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The tool can also offer information about local homeostatic calcium activity events in neurites.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fH_ykpqpmQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Juan Prada</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006054</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Prada, Manju Sasi, Corinna Martin, Sibylle Jablonka, Thomas Dandekar, Robert Blum&lt;/p&gt;

The results of our recent study on mathematical modeling of microbial genome evolution indicate that, on average, genomes of bacteria and archaea evolve in the regime of mutation-selection balance defined by positive selection coefficients associated with gene acquisition that is counter-acted by the intrinsic deletion bias. This analysis was based on the strong assumption that parameters of genome evolution are universal across the diversity of bacteria and archaea, and yielded extremely low values of the selection coefficient. Here we further refine the modeling approach by taking into account evolutionary factors specific for individual groups of microbes using two independent fitting strategies, an ad hoc hard fitting scheme and a mixture model.

The results of our recent study on mathematical modeling of microbial genome evolution indicate that, on average, genomes of bacteria and archaea evolve in the regime of mutation-selection balance defined by positive selection coefficients associated with gene acquisition that is counter-acted by the intrinsic deletion bias. This analysis was based on the strong assumption that parameters of genome evolution are universal across the diversity of bacteria and archaea, and yielded extremely low values of the selection coefficient. Here we further refine the modeling approach by taking into account evolutionary factors specific for individual groups of microbes using two independent fitting strategies, an ad hoc hard fitting scheme and a mixture model. The resulting estimate of the mean selection coefficient of &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;∼10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; associated with the gain of one gene implies that, on average, acquisition of a gene is beneficial, and that microbial genomes typically evolve under a weak selection regime that might transition to strong selection in highly abundant organisms with large effective population sizes. The apparent selective pressure towards larger genomes is balanced by the deletion bias, which is estimated to be consistently greater than unity for all analyzed groups of microbes. The estimated values of &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; are more realistic than the lower values obtained previously, indicating that global and group-specific evolutionary factors synergistically affect microbial genome evolution that seems to be driven primarily by adaptation to existence in diverse niches.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Itamar Sela</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195571</link></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1626967e384:6423c39:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289934v1?rss=1</originId><description>Biomarkers lie at the heart of precision medicine, biodiversity monitoring, agricultural pathogen detection, amongst others.

Numerous problems encountered in computational biology can be formulated as optimization problems. In this context, optimization of drug release characteristics or dosing schedules for anticancer agents has become a prominent area not only for the development of new drugs, but also for established drugs. However, in complex systems, optimization of drug exposure is not a trivial task and cannot be efficiently addressed through trial-error simulation exercises. Finding a solution to those problems is a challenging task which requires more advanced strategies like optimal control theory. In this work, we perform an optimal control analysis on a previously developed computational model for the testosterone effects of Triptorelin in prostate cancer patients with the goal of finding optimal drug-release characteristics. We demonstrate how numerical control optimization of non-linear models can be used to find better therapeutic approaches in order to improve the final outcome of the patients.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8wx1FdaORT0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Itziar Irurzun-Arana</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006087</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Itziar Irurzun-Arana, Alvaro Janda, Sergio Ardanza-Trevijano, Iñaki F.

Protein trafficking within cilia is mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery composed of large protein complexes. The BBSome consists of eight BBS proteins encoded by causative genes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and has been implicated in the trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), by connecting the IFT machinery to cargo GPCRs. Membrane recruitment of the BBSome to promote cargo trafficking has been proposed to be regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase ARL6/BBS3, through its interaction with the BBS1 subunit of the BBSome. We here investigated how the BBSome core subcomplex composed of BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 assembles and interacts with ARL6, and found that the ARL6–BBS1 interaction is reinforced by BBS9. &lt;i&gt;BBS1&lt;/i&gt;-knockout (KO) cells showed defects in the ciliary entry of other BBSome subunits and ARL6, and in ciliary retrograde trafficking and the export of the GPCRs, Smoothened and GPR161. The trafficking defect of these GPCRs was rescued by the exogenous expression of wild-type BBS1, but not by its mutant lacking BBS9-binding ability. Our data thus indicate that the intact BBSome is required for retrograde trafficking of GPCRs out of cilia.</description><updated>1522270800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195005</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195005</canonicalUrl><title>BBS1 is involved in retrograde trafficking of ciliary GPCRs in the context of the BBSome complex</title><published>1522270800000</published><fingerprint>761ea815</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shohei Nozaki, Yohei Katoh, Takuya Kobayashi, Kazuhisa Nakayama&lt;/p&gt;

LdtR is a master regulator of gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Liberibacter asiaticus&lt;/i&gt;, one of the causative agents of citrus greening disease.

Background &lt;p&gt;Low birth weight infant (LBWIs) are prone to mental and behavioural problems. As an important constituent of the brain and retina, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential for foetal infant mental and visual development.

Background &lt;p&gt;Low birth weight infant (LBWIs) are prone to mental and behavioural problems. As an important constituent of the brain and retina, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential for foetal infant mental and visual development. The effect of lactation supplemented with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) on the improvement of intelligence in low birth weight children requires further validation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this study, a comprehensive search of multiple databases was performed to identify studies focused the association between intelligence and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in LBWIs.

Adapting community-based protected areas to local context and evaluating their success across a range of possible socio-economic and ecological outcomes depends, in part, on understanding the perceptions of local actors. This article presents results from a mixed methods study that focuses on how and why religious identity, a prominent aspect of Ghanaian culture, is related to perceptions of the performance of several Community Resource Management Areas (CREMAs). CREMAs are a form of Ghanaian protected area that emphasizes community participation and a range of socio-economic and ecological objectives. Using importance-satisfaction analysis, large-scale survey results show that respondents that identify as Christians consistently assign greater importance to CREMA outcomes than do those that identify with Traditional religions. Education and whether respondents were native to an area (both of which were correlated with religious identity) were also systematically related to perceptions of CREMA importance, with those that are educated and non-native to an area tending to assign higher importance to CREMA outcomes. Follow up focus group participants from the Avu Lagoon CREMA suggest that the patterns result from differing ‘openness’ to new ideas, relative dependence on natural resources, acceptance of Traditional practices associated with conservation, and a sense, for some, that ecological conditions are divinely ordained. Christianity, education and non-nativity are associated with much larger performance gaps, particularly with respect to socio-economic impacts. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for conservation interventions and the use of perceptions in assessing protected area performance.</description><updated>1522962000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195498</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195498</canonicalUrl><title>Religion and perceptions of community-based conservation in Ghana, West Africa</title><published>1522962000000</published><fingerprint>9befc27c</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Grant Murray, Andrew Agyare&lt;/p&gt;

The role of mental imagery has been puzzling researchers for more than two millennia. Both positive and negative effects of mental imagery on information processing have been discussed. The aim of this work was to examine how mental imagery affects object recognition and associative learning. Based on different perceptual and cognitive accounts we tested our &lt;i&gt;imagery-induced interaction hypothesis&lt;/i&gt; in a series of two experiments. According to that, mental imagery could lead to (1) a superior performance in object recognition and associative learning if these objects are imagery-congruent (semantically) and to (2) an inferior performance if these objects are imagery-incongruent. In the first experiment, we used a static environment and tested associative learning. In the second experiment, subjects encoded object information in a dynamic environment by means of a virtual sewer system. Our results demonstrate that subjects who received a role adoption task (by means of guided mental imagery) performed better when imagery-congruent objects were used and worse when imagery-incongruent objects were used. We finally discuss our findings also with respect to alternative accounts and plead for a multi-methodological approach for future research in order to solve this issue.</description><updated>1522270800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194227</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194227</canonicalUrl><title>A rat in the sewer: How mental imagery interacts with object recognition</title><published>1522270800000</published><fingerprint>7ab1db83</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Harun Karimpur, Kai Hamburger&lt;/p&gt;

Although tau pathology, behavioral deficits, and neuronal loss are observed in patients with tauopathies, the relationship between these endpoints has not been clearly established. Here we found that rTg4510 mice, which overexpress human mutant tau in the forebrain, develop progressive age-dependent increases in locomotor activity (LMA), which correlates with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, hyperphosphorylated tau levels, and brain atrophy. To further clarify the relationship between these endpoints, we treated the rTg4510 mice with either doxycycline to reduce mutant tau expression or an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor Thiamet G, which has been shown to ameliorate tau pathology in animal models. We found that both doxycycline and Thiamet G treatments starting at 2 months of age prevented the progression of hyperactivity, slowed brain atrophy, and reduced brain hyperphosphorylated tau. In contrast, initiating doxycycline treatment at 4 months reduced neither brain hyperphosphorylated tau nor hyperactivity, further confirming the relationship between these measures. Collectively, our results demonstrate a unique behavioral phenotype in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy that strongly correlates with disease progression, and that early interventions which reduce tau pathology ameliorate the progression of the locomotor dysfunction. These findings suggest that better understanding the relationship between locomotor deficits and tau pathology in the rTg4510 model may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying behavioral disturbances in patients with tauopathies.</description><updated>1523048400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195486</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195486</canonicalUrl><title>Early intervention of tau pathology prevents behavioral changes in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy</title><published>1523048400000</published><fingerprint>b761e70b</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaohai Wang, Karen Smith, Michelle Pearson, Anna Hughes, Mali L.

Soil respiration induced by biological soil crusts (BSCs) is an important process in the carbon (C) cycle in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, where vascular plants are restricted by the harsh environment, particularly the limited soil moisture. However, the interaction between temperature and soil respiration remains uncertain because of the number of factors that control soil respiration, including temperature and soil moisture, especially in BSC-dominated areas. In this study, the soil respiration in moss-dominated crusts and lichen-dominated crusts was continuously measured using an automated soil respiration system over a one-year period from November 2015 to October 2016 in the Shapotou region of the Tengger Desert, northern China. The results indicated that over daily cycles, the half-hourly soil respiration rates in both types of BSC-covered areas were commonly related to the soil temperature. The observed diel hysteresis between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature in the BSC-covered areas was limited by nonlinearity loops with semielliptical shapes, and soil temperature often peaked later than the half-hourly soil respiration rates in the BSC-covered areas. The average lag times between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature for both types of BSC-covered areas were two hours over the diel cycles, and they were negatively and linearly related to the volumetric soil water content. Our results highlight the diel hysteresis phenomenon that occurs between soil respiration rates and soil temperatures in BSC-covered areas and the negative response of this phenomenon to soil moisture, which may influence total C budget evaluations. Therefore, the interactive effects of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration in BSC-covered areas should be considered in global carbon cycle models of desert ecosystems.</description><updated>1523048400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</canonicalUrl><title>Diel hysteresis between soil respiration and soil temperature in a biological soil crust covered desert ecosystem</title><published>1523048400000</published><fingerprint>e6b1c326</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guan, Xinrong Li, Peng Zhang, Yongle Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Many catabolic stimuli, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) in combination with oncostatin M (OSM), promote cartilage breakdown via the induction of collagen-degrading collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (&lt;i&gt;MMP1&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; in human articular chondrocytes. Indeed, joint diseases with an inflammatory component are characterised by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) catabolism. Importantly, protein kinase C (PKC) signalling has a primary role in cytokine-induced &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt; expression, and is known to regulate cellular functions associated with pathologies involving ECM remodelling. At present, substrates downstream of PKC remain undefined. Herein, we show that both IL-1- and OSM-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase D (PKD) in human chondrocytes is strongly associated with signalling via the atypical PKCι isoform. Consequently, inhibiting PKD activation with a pan-PKD inhibitor significantly reduced the expression of &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Specific gene silencing of the PKD isoforms revealed that only PKD3 (&lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt;) depletion mirrored the observed &lt;i&gt;MMP&lt;/i&gt; repression, indicative of the pharmacological inhibitor specifically affecting only this isoform. &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing was also shown to reduce serine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as phosphorylation of all three mitogen-activated protein kinase groups. This altered signalling following &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing led to a significant reduction in the expression of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) genes &lt;i&gt;FOS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JUN&lt;/i&gt;, critical for the induction of many MMPs including &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the AP-1 factor activating transcription factor 3 (&lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt;) was also reduced concomitant with the observed reduction in &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; expression. Taken together, we highlight an important role for PKD3 in the pro-inflammatory signalling that promotes cartilage destruction.</description><updated>1523653200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195864</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195864</canonicalUrl><title>Protein kinase D3 modulates MMP1 and MMP13 expression in human chondrocytes</title><published>1523653200000</published><fingerprint>31c2311e</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Baker, Adrian M.

The immunological profiles of human specific IgE (sIgE) and specific IgG4 (sIgG4) vary by genetic predisposition, living conditions in different geographical locations and patient’s age. The aim of our study was to analyze sIgE and sIgG4 patterns and their age-dependent changes in patients from the Moscow region. For identifying sIgE and sIgG4 profiles the blood samples from 513 patients aged 6 months to 17 years who were showing symptoms of allergic diseases were analyzed using microarrays containing 31 allergens. The highest sIgE prevalence was observed for birch pollen (32%) among pollen allergens, cat dander (24%) among indoor allergens, and egg whites (21%) among food allergens. The most common sIgG4 response was developed toward egg whites (80% of patients). Age-related elevation was identified for patients with increased sIgE to pollen allergens and indoor allergens (cat or dog dander and house dust mites). For each allergen, the proportion of cases with significant levels of sIgG4 appeared to increase with patients’ age. The data on allergen-specific sIgE and sIgG4 prevalence show both general trends and some local special aspects that are indicative for the Moscow region. This information should be useful in terms of epidemiology of allergic diseases.</description><updated>1521752400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194775</href></item></alternate><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194775</canonicalUrl><title>Patterns of sensitization to inhalant and food allergens among pediatric patients from the Moscow region (Russian Federation)</title><published>1521752400000</published><fingerprint>51b4d1bc</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sergei Voloshin, Olga Smoldovskaya, Guzel Feyzkhanova, Alla Arefieva, Lyudmila Pavlushkina, Tatiana Filatova, Veronika Butvilovskaya, Marina Filippova, Yuri Lysov, Sergey Shcherbo, Alexander Makarov, Alla Rubina, Alexander Zasedatelev&lt;/p&gt;

This obviously is most important (and can have the biggest effect) if your compound has a short half-life after dosing to begin with (and plenty of compounds do). As the paper notes, if you have constant clearance for the unbound fraction of your compound, then the relationship between dose and half-life is exponential, not linear (whereas most of the other combinations you can come up with are simply linear ones). That really gives you a handle to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, you don’t have to wait until human data to worry about such things. The allometric scaling factor between rats and humans is about 4.3, so if you’ve done your homework about what the mechanisms of clearance are (which enzymes are responsible and how well they correlate to human ones, for example), you’re ready to work from there. The paper notes, though, that these sorts of correlations have a much higher chance of going haywire on you for very short half-life compounds (less than two hours, say), so if you want to have any confidence at all in your dose prediction models, you really should get rat half-life out longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group shows a plot of about 10,000 Merck compounds with rat measurements of unbound-clearance versus steady-state volume of distribution, and it’s (as you might figure) a pretty good correlation. The key, then, is to find changes in a molecule’s structure that will get it off that line, because otherwise you’ll end up in a similar situation to where you started. That is, you can find yourself reducing the unbound clearance and ending up with an effective half life that’s not really improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what sorts of modifications actually improve the half-life? The paper shows the result of a large matched-molecular-pairs (MMP) analysis, where structures were varied at only one place. Increasing lipophilicity will do the trick, sometimes, if the partitioning of your compound into tissue increases more than just its binding to plasma proteins. The Merck data suggest that adding multiple fluorines to a compound’s structure tends to have this effect. The fluorinated compounds tend, apparently, to bind to tissue at an increased rate more than they bind to serum albumin. You may or may not be comfortable with this advice, since polyfluorinated compounds may also be harder to formulate, and some of that tissue binding may be to things that you’d rather not bind to. But it will increase your half-life, and it’s up to each med-chem team to see if they want to make that deal with this particular fluorocarbon-coated devil. The free lunch has (still) not yet arrived in the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, another classic way to increase half-life is to block sites of metabolism. The Merck group noted this in a general way with matched molecular pairs that changed hydrogens to chlorines, hydrogens to methyls, and methyls to chlorines. H to Cl increased half life, presumably for similar reasons to fluorination. H to methyl did not, though: that does increase lipophilicity, but at the expense of adding new groups for the liver enzymes to chew on. But methyl to chloro did improve half-lives, on average – the lipophilicities are nearly the same, but you’ve battened down the hatches for enzymatic degradation. (As you’d imagine, H to CF3 is the extreme example of this effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about replacing with more polar groups, rather than with nonstick coatings? On average, phenyl to pyridyl lowers half life, H to OH does too, and H to COOH &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lowers half-life. It’s worth noting that the carboxylic acids, overall, tend to have higher binding to plasma protein, so that tells you that the increased half-life of the halogenated compounds isn’t coming about by that mechanism, at least not exclusively. It’s worth noting, though, that just greasing up your compounds is not the answer. Fluorination and chlorination seem to work, but as a look at the broader MMP universe shows, increasing lipophilicity in general does not necessarily help your half-life. Decreasing lipophilicity, on the other hand, has a much better chance of hurting it. It looks, overall, as if the steady-state volume of distribution is more sensitive to modifications in the structure than is clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper has a list of groups that seem to help with increasing half-life, more often than not, and ones that seem to hurt. In addition to general halogenation, others in the first beneficial category include primary amines, NH pyrrolidines, piperidines, piperazines, and morpholines, 3,4-dihaloaryls, and (interestingly) 2-methyl-4-pyrimidones. In the likely-to-lower category, on the other hand, are pyridines and pyrimidines attached at the 2 position, N-attached pyrazoles (and other related 5-membered heterocycles that have that core), unsubstituted phenyls (and 4-pyridyls), primary alcohols, and simple cyclopropyls.

Background &lt;p&gt;Segmentation of heterogeneous patient populations into parsimonious and relatively homogenous groups with similar healthcare needs can facilitate healthcare resource planning and development of effective integrated healthcare interventions for each segment. We aimed to apply a data-driven, healthcare utilization-based clustering analysis to segment a regional health system patient population and validate its discriminative ability on 4-year longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality data.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We extracted data from the Singapore Health Services Electronic Health Intelligence System, an electronic medical record database that included healthcare utilization (inpatient admissions, specialist outpatient clinic visits, emergency department visits, and primary care clinic visits), mortality, diseases, and demographics for all adult Singapore residents who resided in and had a healthcare encounter with our regional health system in 2012. Hierarchical clustering analysis (Ward’s linkage) and K-means cluster analysis using age and healthcare utilization data in 2012 were applied to segment the selected population. These segments were compared using their demographics (other than age) and morbidities in 2012, and longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 146,999 subjects, five distinct patient segments “Young, healthy”; “Middle age, healthy”; “Stable, chronic disease”; “Complicated chronic disease” and “Frequent admitters” were identified. Healthcare utilization patterns in 2012, morbidity patterns and demographics differed significantly across all segments. The “Frequent admitters” segment had the smallest number of patients (1.79% of the population) but consumed 69% of inpatient admissions, 77% of specialist outpatient visits, 54% of emergency department visits, and 23% of primary care clinic visits in 2012. 11.5% and 31.2% of this segment has end stage renal failure and malignancy respectively. The validity of cluster-analysis derived segments is supported by discriminative ability for longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016. Incident rate ratios for healthcare utilization and Cox hazards ratio for mortality increased as patient segments increased in complexity. Patients in the “Frequent admitters” segment accounted for a disproportionate healthcare utilization and 8.16 times higher mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our data-driven clustering analysis on a general patient population in Singapore identified five patient segments with distinct longitudinal healthcare utilization patterns and mortality risk to provide an evidence-based segmentation of a regional health system’s healthcare needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1522962000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195243</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195243</canonicalUrl><title>Assessing the validity of a data driven segmentation approach: A 4 year longitudinal study of healthcare utilization and mortality</title><published>1522962000000</published><fingerprint>dfc2be54</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lian Leng Low, Shi Yan, Yu Heng Kwan, Chuen Seng Tan, Julian Thumboo&lt;/p&gt;

We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of combined use of salivary gland ultrasonography (US) and the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatic Disease (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for improving the diagnostic efficiency in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). A US-based salivary gland disease grading system was developed using a cohort comprising 213 SS or non-SS patients who fulfilled the minimum requirements for classifying SS based on the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and ACR criteria. Using 62 SS or non-SS patients from the 213 patients and who had also undergone all the 5 examinations needed for the ACR/EULAR classification, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of various combinations of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications for diagnosing SS, using the clinical diagnosis of SS by rheumatologists as the gold standard. The ACR/EULAR criteria discriminated clinical SS patients with 77% and 79% accuracy for those with primary or secondary SS and for those with primary SS, respectively. However, the integrated score system of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications yielded 92% and 93% accuracy for these 2 SS patient groups, respectively, provided that US score of 3 was assigned to patients with US grade ≥2, and then patients with integrated threshold score of ≥5 were diagnosed as SS. Cross-validation also indicated improved accuracy of the integrated ACR/EULAR and US score system (91.9 and 93.0% for primary/secondary and primary SS patients, respectively) over that by the ACR/EULAR criteria alone. (74.2 and 86.0%, respectively). The integrated ACR/EULAR and US scoring system can improve the diagnosis of patients with clinical SS.</description><updated>1522789200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195113</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195113</canonicalUrl><title>Combined classification system based on ACR/EULAR and ultrasonographic scores for improving the diagnosis of Sjögren&apos;s syndrome</title><published>1522789200000</published><fingerprint>5914b6d6</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yukinori Takagi, Hideki Nakamura, Misa Sumi, Toshimasa Shimizu, Yasuko Hirai, Yoshiro Horai, Ayuko Takatani, Atsushi Kawakami, Sato Eida, Miho Sasaki, Takashi Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

This national online cross-sectional survey in Italy assessed primary care pediatricians’ (PCPs) attitudes and practices regarding Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and the contribution of several characteristics. The questionnaire was distributed from September 2016 to June 2017 to a random sample of 640 PCPs by email via an internet-link leading to a web-based survey platform (Lime Survey). Only 18.4% of PCPs always recommend the HPV vaccine to 11–12 year old boys. PCPs with longer practice activity, working in solo practice, always recommended the HPV vaccine to 11–12 year old girls, and believed that the vaccine was effective for boys were more likely to always recommend the HPV vaccine. PCPs working in a Region where the vaccination was actively recommended and provided free of charge to 11–12 year old boys had higher odds of recommending vaccination. More than two thirds of PCPs (77.4%) always recommend the HPV vaccine to 11–12 year old girls. PCPs who believed that the vaccine was effective for girls and safe in both boys and girls, who always talk with patients of 11–18 years or their parents about HPV infection and vaccination, and who obtain vaccine information from scientific journals were more likely to always recommend the vaccine. PCPs should employ evidence-based educational strategies in order to achieve a better coverage and to reduce the morbidities and mortality of diseases associated with HPV.</description><updated>1522357200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194920</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194920</canonicalUrl><title>Primary care pediatricians’ attitudes and practice towards HPV vaccination: A nationwide survey in Italy</title><published>1522357200000</published><fingerprint>ee3168a7</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Napolitano, Monica Navaro, Luigi Vezzosi, Gabriella Santagati, Italo Francesco Angelillo&lt;/p&gt;

Sensing the environmental signals, the canonical Gα-cAMP/PKA pathway modulates mycelial growth and development, and negatively regulates some secondary metabolism in filamentous fungi, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. aflatoxin in &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus nidulans&lt;/i&gt;. Here we report the characterization of this signaling pathway in &lt;i&gt;Chaetomium globosum&lt;/i&gt;, a widely spread fungus known for synthesizing abundant secondary metabolites, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. chaetoglobosin A (ChA). RNAi-mediated knockdown of a putative Gα-encoding gene &lt;i&gt;gna-1&lt;/i&gt;, led to plural changes in phenotype, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. albino mycelium, significant restriction on perithecium development and decreased production of ChA. RNA-seq profiling and qRT-PCR verified significantly fall in expression of corresponding genes, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pks-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CgcheA&lt;/i&gt;. These defects could be restored by simultaneous knock-down of the &lt;i&gt;pkaR&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding a regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), suggesting that &lt;i&gt;pkaR&lt;/i&gt; had a negative effect on the above mentioned traits. Confirmatively, the intracellular level of cAMP in wild-type strain was about 3.4-fold to that in &lt;i&gt;gna-1&lt;/i&gt; silenced mutant pG14, and addition of a cAMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP, restored the same defects, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., the expression of &lt;i&gt;CgcheA&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the intracellular cAMP in &lt;i&gt;gna-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pkaR&lt;/i&gt; double silenced mutant was approaching the normal level. The following activity inhibition experiment proved that the expression of &lt;i&gt;CgcheA&lt;/i&gt; was indeed regulated by PKA. Down-regulation of &lt;i&gt;LaeA/VeA/SptJ&lt;/i&gt; expression in &lt;i&gt;gna-1&lt;/i&gt; mutant was also observed, implying that Gα signaling may crosstalk to other regulatory pathways. Taken together, this study proposes that the heterotrimeric Gα protein-cAMP/PKA signaling pathway positively mediates the sexual development, melanin biosynthesis, and secondary metabolism in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;globosum&lt;/i&gt;.</description><updated>1523653200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195553</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><title>Gα-cAMP/PKA pathway positively regulates pigmentation, chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis and sexual development in &amp;lt;i&gt;Chaetomium globosum&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><published>1523653200000</published><fingerprint>1bfaf47f</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yang Hu, Xiaoran Hao, Longfei Chen, Oren Akhberdi, Xi Yu, Yanjie Liu, Xudong Zhu&lt;/p&gt;

Confirmatively, the intracellular level of cAMP in wild-type strain was about 3.4-fold to that in &lt;i&gt;gna-1&lt;/i&gt; silenced mutant pG14, and addition of a cAMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP, restored the same defects, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., the expression of &lt;i&gt;CgcheA&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the intracellular cAMP in &lt;i&gt;gna-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pkaR&lt;/i&gt; double silenced mutant was approaching the normal level. The following activity inhibition experiment proved that the expression of &lt;i&gt;CgcheA&lt;/i&gt; was indeed regulated by PKA. Down-regulation of &lt;i&gt;LaeA/VeA/SptJ&lt;/i&gt; expression in &lt;i&gt;gna-1&lt;/i&gt; mutant was also observed, implying that Gα signaling may crosstalk to other regulatory pathways. Taken together, this study proposes that the heterotrimeric Gα protein-cAMP/PKA signaling pathway positively mediates the sexual development, melanin biosynthesis, and secondary metabolism in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;globosum&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Yang Hu</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195553</link></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16267cac4eb:61491ad:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03791-4</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Freeman Dyson’s life of scientific delight&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman Dyson’s life of scientific delight, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03791-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03791-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ann Finkbeiner is charmed by the originality and acuity in the physicist’s letters.</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><engagement>45</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03791-4</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522159764715</crawled><title>Freeman Dyson’s life of scientific delight</title><published>1522134000000</published><fingerprint>fb64b655</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Freeman Dyson’s life of scientific delight&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman Dyson’s life of scientific delight, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03791-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03791-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ann Finkbeiner is charmed by the originality and acuity in the physicist’s letters.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Ann Finkbeiner</name></author><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03791-4</link><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03791-4/d41586-018-03791-4_15559640.jpg</url><height>576</height><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual></item><item><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_162b13a356e:5c2f81:76251cdd</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00201</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00201/20180410/images/medium/bi-2018-00201z_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00201&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Retention, defined as continuous engagement in care, is an important indicator for quality of healthcare services. To achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, emphasis on retention as a predictor of viral suppression in patients initiated on ART is vital. Using routinely collected clinical data, the authors sought to determine the effect of age on retention post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;De-identified electronic data for 32965 HIV-infected persons aged ≥15 years at enrolment into the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program between January 2008 and December 2014 were analyzed. Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson’s Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ≥50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults. Retention rates in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation were 73.9% (95% CL: 72.2, 75.5), 62.9% (95% CL: 61.0, 64.7) and 55.4% (95% CL: 53.5, 57.3) among older adults compared to 69.8% (95% CL: 69.1, 70.4), 58.1% (95% CL: 57.4, 58.8) and 49.3% (95% CL: 48.6, 50.0) among younger adults (p &amp;lt;0.001). A higher proportion of older adults were retained in HIV care post ART initiation compared to younger adults, Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) though they were more likely to die, AHR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of older adults are initiated on ART and have better retention in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation than younger adults.

Background &lt;p&gt;Retention, defined as continuous engagement in care, is an important indicator for quality of healthcare services. To achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, emphasis on retention as a predictor of viral suppression in patients initiated on ART is vital. Using routinely collected clinical data, the authors sought to determine the effect of age on retention post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;De-identified electronic data for 32965 HIV-infected persons aged ≥15 years at enrolment into the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program between January 2008 and December 2014 were analyzed. Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson’s Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ≥50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults. Retention rates in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation were 73.9% (95% CL: 72.2, 75.5), 62.9% (95% CL: 61.0, 64.7) and 55.4% (95% CL: 53.5, 57.3) among older adults compared to 69.8% (95% CL: 69.1, 70.4), 58.1% (95% CL: 57.4, 58.8) and 49.3% (95% CL: 48.6, 50.0) among younger adults (p &amp;lt;0.001). A higher proportion of older adults were retained in HIV care post ART initiation compared to younger adults, Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) though they were more likely to die, AHR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of older adults are initiated on ART and have better retention in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation than younger adults. However, older adults have a higher all-cause mortality rate, perhaps partially driven by late presentation to care.

Chronic stress is an important factor influencing people’s health. It usually causes endocrinal disorders and a decline in reproduction in females. Although studies of both human and animals suggest a detrimental effect of stress on reproduction, the influence of chronic stress on the ovarian reservation and follicular development is still not clear. In this study, a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model was used to investigate the effect of stress on ovarian reservation and follicular development and explore the underlying mechanism. In this study, after 8 weeks of CRS, primordial follicles were excessively activated in the ovaries of the CRS group compared with the control group. Further results showed that the activation of primordial follicles induced by CRS was involved in the increasing expression level of Kit ligand and its receptor Kit and the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. The corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide released due to stress, which plays an important role in regulating follicle development. A high level of serum CRH was detected in the CRS mouse model, and the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay showed that the mRNA level of its main receptor CRHR1increased in the ovaries of the CRS mouse group. Moreover, 100nM CRH significantly improved the activation of primordial follicles in newborn mouse ovaries &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. These results demonstrated that CRS could induce immoderate activation of primordial follicles accompanied by the activation of Kit-PI3K signaling, in which CRH might be an important endocrine factor.</description><updated>1522443600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194894</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194894</canonicalUrl><title>Chronic restraint stress induces excessive activation of primordial follicles in mice ovaries</title><published>1522443600000</published><fingerprint>63232578</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Minhua Xu, Junyan Sun, Qian Wang, Qiuwan Zhang, Chunsheng Wei, Dongmei Lai&lt;/p&gt;

Skeletal muscle (SM) health and integrity is dependent on the dynamic balance between protein synthesis and degradation, and central to this process is the availability of amino acids (AA) in the amino pool. While Doxorubicin (DOX) remains one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies, little is known of the effect of the drug on SM, particularly its effect on the availability of amino acids in the tissue. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of DOX administration on vascular, interstitial and intracellular concentrations of AA in SM of the rat up to 8 days after the administration of a 1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg i.p. dose of DOX. In the plasma, total amino acids (TAA) were significantly increased compared to control where greater (P&amp;lt;0.05) concentrations were observed following the 1.5 mg/kg dose compared to the 4.5 mg/kg dose. Compared to control, the 1.5 mg/kg dose resulted in an increase (P&amp;lt;0.05) in interstitial TAA whereas the 4.5 mg/kg resulted in a sustained decrease (P&amp;lt;0.05). Intracellular TAA, essential amino acids (EAA) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) where significantly increased in each muscle group analyzed, following the 1.5 and 4.5 mg/kg doses compared to control. This study provides important insight into the amino acid response following DOX chemotherapy and presents a substantial foundation for future studies focused on reducing SM damage and recovery by targeting amino acid metabolism.</description><updated>1522875600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195330</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195330</canonicalUrl><title>Doxorubicin chemotherapy affects the intracellular and interstitial free amino acid pools in skeletal muscle</title><published>1522875600000</published><fingerprint>bc1ca964</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sergio Fabris, David A.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of DOX administration on vascular, interstitial and intracellular concentrations of AA in SM of the rat up to 8 days after the administration of a 1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg i.p. dose of DOX. In the plasma, total amino acids (TAA) were significantly increased compared to control where greater (P&amp;lt;0.05) concentrations were observed following the 1.5 mg/kg dose compared to the 4.5 mg/kg dose. Compared to control, the 1.5 mg/kg dose resulted in an increase (P&amp;lt;0.05) in interstitial TAA whereas the 4.5 mg/kg resulted in a sustained decrease (P&amp;lt;0.05). Intracellular TAA, essential amino acids (EAA) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) where significantly increased in each muscle group analyzed, following the 1.5 and 4.5 mg/kg doses compared to control. This study provides important insight into the amino acid response following DOX chemotherapy and presents a substantial foundation for future studies focused on reducing SM damage and recovery by targeting amino acid metabolism.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Sergio Fabris</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195330</link></item><item><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_162df916472:59fbc0:bdf8aaf1</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00579</originId><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00579&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

However, the quality of any prediction based on molecular dynamics results will strongly depend on the validity of underlying physical assumptions.
Unphysical behavior of simulations can have significant influence on the results and reproducibility of these simulations, such as folding of proteins and DNA or properties of lipid bilayers determined by cutoff treatment, dynamics of peptides and polymers affected by the choice of thermostat, or liquid properties depending on the simulation time step. Motivated by such examples, we propose a two-fold approach to increase the robustness of molecular simulations. The first part of this approach involves tests which can be performed by the users of MD programs on their respective systems and setups. We present a number of tests of different complexity, ranging from simple post-processing analysis to more involved tests requiring additional simulations. These tests are shown to significantly increase the reliability of MD simulations by catching a number of common simulation errors violating physical assumptions, such as non-conservative integrators, deviations from the Boltzmann ensemble, and lack of ergodicity between degrees of freedom. To make the usage as easy as possible, we have developed an open-source and platform-independent Python library (https://physical-validation.readthedocs.io) implementing these tests.
The second part of the approach involves testing for code correctness. While unphysical behavior can be due to poor or incompatible choices of parameters by the user, it can just as well originate in coding errors within the program. We therefore propose to include physical validation tests in the code-checking mechanism of MD software packages. We have implemented such a validation for the GROMACS software package, ensuring that every major releases passes a number of physical sanity checks performed on selected representative systems before shipping. It is, to our knowledge, the first major molecular mechanics software package to run such validation routinely.

On a daily basis, planktonic organisms migrate vertically and thus experience widely varying conditions in their physico-chemical environment. In the Gulf of Finland, these changes are larger than values predicted by climate change scenarios predicted for the next century (up to 0.5 units in pH and 5°C in temperature). In this work, we are interested in how temporal variations in physico-chemical characteristics of the water column on a daily and weekly scale influence oxidative stress level and antioxidant responses in the planktonic copepod of the genus &lt;i&gt;Acartia&lt;/i&gt;. Responses were determined from samples collected during a two-week field survey in the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Our results showed that GST (Glutathione-S-transferase) enzyme activity increased in the surface waters between Weeks I and II, indicating antioxidant defense mechanism activation. This is most likely due to elevating temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen observed between these two weeks. During Week II also GSSG (oxidized glutathione) was detected, indicating that copepods responded to stressor(s) in the environment. Our results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Acartia&lt;/i&gt; copepods seem fairly tolerant to weekly fluctuations in environmental conditions in coastal and estuarine areas, in terms of antioxidant defense and oxidative stress. This could be directly connected to a very efficient glutathione cycling system acting as antioxidant defense system for neutralizing ROS and avoiding elevated levels of LPX.</description><updated>1523653200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195981</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195981</canonicalUrl><title>Oxidative stress and antioxidant defense responses in &amp;lt;i&gt;Acartia&amp;lt;/i&gt; copepods in relation to environmental factors</title><published>1523653200000</published><fingerprint>6e289a4</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Olivier Glippa, Jonna Engström-Öst, Mirella Kanerva, Anni Rein, Kristiina Vuori&lt;/p&gt;

Births outside marriage (BoM) account for around 15% of all births globally. However, the distribution around the world is very uneven, as are cultural and political attitudes towards them. Studies from East Asia have shown that the percentage of such births is very low, with only modest increases in recent years. The orthodox demographic view holds that the maintenance of conservative views around the relationship between marriage and childbearing can play a role in keeping fertility low. Prenuptial pregnancies (PNP) (where births occur within eight months of marriage) have been identified as a growing phenomenon in Japan, possibly being an ‘alternative’ Asian pathway to family formation. As yet, no comprehensive statistical analysis of the trends of BoM or PNP has been performed for Hong Kong. Using a comprehensive microdata set of birth registration in Hong Kong from 1984–2015 (N = 1,680,831) we provide evidence of recent trends in such ‘alternative pathways’ to family formation and examine predictors through regression analysis. Our results indicate, in common with elsewhere in East Asia, low overall period rates of either BoM or PNP (although the latter has risen notably in recent years). While more recent birth cohorts exhibit higher prevalence of such births, their incomplete nature and higher expected propensity suggests that the figures are exaggerated. In our regression analysis, we find that lower educational attainment is a strong predictor of both BoM and PNP, suggesting that a bifurcation of experience may be occurring. This adds further evidence to the theory that the maintenance of traditional family formation systems in the context of revolutionised educational and work opportunities for women mean that the opportunity costs of the ‘marriage package’ become too high. Current disparities in rights and privileges between married and unmarried parents–and especially their children–means that targeted family planning services and support for vulnerable families are policy priorities.</description><updated>1522357200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194948</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194948</canonicalUrl><title>The changing relationship between marriage and childbearing in Hong Kong</title><published>1522357200000</published><fingerprint>de73defb</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stuart Gietel-Basten, Georgia Verropoulou&lt;/p&gt;
Births outside marriage (BoM) account for around 15% of all births globally. However, the distribution around the world is very uneven, as are cultural and political attitudes towards them. Studies from East Asia have shown that the percentage of such births is very low, with only modest increases in recent years. The orthodox demographic view holds that the maintenance of conservative views around the relationship between marriage and childbearing can play a role in keeping fertility low. Prenuptial pregnancies (PNP) (where births occur within eight months of marriage) have been identified as a growing phenomenon in Japan, possibly being an ‘alternative’ Asian pathway to family formation.

Leukemic cells often carry chromosome aberrations which generate chimeric genes of pathogenetic, diagnostic, and prognostic importance. New rearrangements giving rise to novel fusion genes define hitherto unrecognized genetic leukemia subgroups. G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular genetic analyses were done on bone marrow cells from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and secondary myelodysplasia. The G-banding analysis revealed the karyotype 46,XX,del(21)(q22)[9]/46,XX[2]. FISH on metaphase spreads with a &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; break apart probe demonstrated that part of &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; (from 21q22) had moved to chromosome band 5p15. RNA sequencing showed in-frame fusion of &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;PDCD6&lt;/i&gt; (from 5p15), something that was verified by RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing. Further FISH analyses with &lt;i&gt;PDCD6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; home-made break apart/double fusion probes showed a red signal (&lt;i&gt;PDCD6&lt;/i&gt;) on chromosome 5, a green signal on chromosome 21 (&lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt;), and two yellow fusion signals, one on der(5) and the other on der(21). Reassessment of the G-banding preparations in light of the FISH and RNA-sequencing data thus yielded the karyotype 46,XX,t(5;21)(p15;q22)[9]/46,XX[2]. The t(5;21)(p15;q22)/&lt;i&gt;RUNX1-PDCD6&lt;/i&gt; was detected only by performing molecular studies of the leukemic cells, but should be sought after also in other leukemic/myelodysplastic cases with del(21q).</description><updated>1524171600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196181</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196181</canonicalUrl><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;RUNX1-PDCD6&amp;lt;/i&gt; fusion resulting from a novel t(5;21)(p15;q22) chromosome translocation in myelodysplastic syndrome secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia</title><published>1524171600000</published><fingerprint>d1890391</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ioannis Panagopoulos, Ludmila Gorunova, Eva-Marie Jacobsen, Kristin Andersen, Francesca Micci, Sverre Heim&lt;/p&gt;

Here, we show that co-evolution can be used to identify quasi-independent gene groups inside of larger cellular systems. Using folate metabolism as a case study, we show that co-evolution indicates a sparse architecture of interactions, with three small groups of genes co-evolving in the midst of others that evolve independently. For one such module - dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) - we use epistasis measurements and forward evolution to demonstrate both internal functional coupling and independence from the remainder of the genome. Mechanistically, the coupling is driven by a constraint on their relative activities, which must be balanced to prevent accumulation of a metabolic intermediate. Applying co-evolution analyses genome-wide reveals a number of other gene pairs with statistical signatures similar to DHFR/TYMS, suggesting that small adaptive units are a general feature of cellular systems.</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/120006v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523911902075</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/16/120006</canonicalUrl><title>A two-enzyme adaptive unit in bacterial folate metabolism [NEW RESULTS]</title><published>1523862000000</published><fingerprint>87177f6f</fingerprint><content><content>The activity of a gene may be influenced or modified by other genes in the genome. Here, we show that co-evolution can be used to identify quasi-independent gene groups inside of larger cellular systems. Using folate metabolism as a case study, we show that co-evolution indicates a sparse architecture of interactions, with three small groups of genes co-evolving in the midst of others that evolve independently. For one such module - dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) - we use epistasis measurements and forward evolution to demonstrate both internal functional coupling and independence from the remainder of the genome.

Vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde), a food additive with rich milk flavor, is commonly used in the food, beverage and cosmetic industries. However, excessive consumption of vanillin may cause liver and kidney damage. Therefore, methods for detecting and controlling the level of vanillin in food, especially in infant powder, have important practical significance. In this study, we established a colorimetric assay for vanillin detection. The detection was performed under high-temperature and acidic conditions, which can induce the reaction of the aldehyde group of vanillin with the amino group of o-toluidine. The resulting product had a maximum absorption at 363 nm, which was quantified by a UV spectrophotometer. This assay had a limit of detection (&lt;i&gt;LOD&lt;/i&gt;) of 1 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and a linear range between 1 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 100 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The average recoveries at three spiked levels were in the range from 91.1% to 101.6% with a relative standard deviation (&lt;i&gt;RSD&lt;/i&gt;) of 4.62% ~ 7.27%.</description><updated>1524258000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194010</href></item></alternate><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194010</canonicalUrl><title>A colorimetric assay for vanillin detection by determination of the luminescence of o-toluidine condensates</title><published>1524258000000</published><fingerprint>f5e02dda</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jin Zhao, Haixiong Xia, Tingyu Yu, Lu Jin, Xuehua Li, Yinghui Zhang, Liping Shu, Lingwen Zeng, Zhixu He&lt;/p&gt;

The detection was performed under high-temperature and acidic conditions, which can induce the reaction of the aldehyde group of vanillin with the amino group of o-toluidine. The resulting product had a maximum absorption at 363 nm, which was quantified by a UV spectrophotometer. This assay had a limit of detection (&lt;i&gt;LOD&lt;/i&gt;) of 1 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and a linear range between 1 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 100 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The average recoveries at three spiked levels were in the range from 91.1% to 101.6% with a relative standard deviation (&lt;i&gt;RSD&lt;/i&gt;) of 4.62% ~ 7.27%.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Jin Zhao</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194010</link></item><item><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162d3641294:320131a:9f3b30f2</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35037</originId><description>How multicellular organisms respond to and are impacted by severe hypothermic stress is largely unknown.

The incidence of cancers attributable to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) that affect males is on the rise. Currently in the UK teenage boys are not vaccinated against HPV while teenage girls are. The rationale for not vaccinating boys is that vaccinating girls should provide herd immunity to boys, however this does not protect men who have sex with men or men who have sex with unvaccinated women.

The immune state of wild animals is largely unknown. Knowing this and what affects it is important in understanding how infection and disease affects wild animals. The immune state of wild animals is also important in understanding the biology of their pathogens, which is directly relevant to explaining pathogen spillover among species, including to humans. The paucity of knowledge about wild animals&apos; immune state is in stark contrast to our exquisitely detailed understanding of the immunobiology of laboratory animals. Making an immune response is costly, and many factors (such as age, sex, infection status, and body condition) have individually been shown to constrain or promote immune responses. But, whether or not these factors affect immune responses and immune state in wild animals, their relative importance, and how they interact (or do not) are unknown. Here, we have investigated the immune ecology of wild house mice—the same species as the laboratory mouse—as an example of a wild mammal, characterising their adaptive humoral, adaptive cellular, and innate immune state. Firstly, we show how immune variation is structured among mouse populations, finding that there can be extensive immune discordance among neighbouring populations. Secondly, we identify the principal factors that underlie the immunological differences among mice, showing that body condition promotes and age constrains individuals’ immune state, while factors such as microparasite infection and season are comparatively unimportant. By applying a multifactorial analysis to an immune system-wide analysis, our results bring a new and unified understanding of the immunobiology of a wild mammal.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6q0s1nnNEUE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Stephen Abolins</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003538</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephen Abolins, Luke Lazarou, Laura Weldon, Louise Hughes, Elizabeth C.

ACDtool can thus analyze datasets from transcriptomic, proteomic, metagenomics, barcoding, ChIP-seq, population genetics, etc, using the same mathematical approach.

The hypothesis that pigs placed on diets with reduced indispensable amino acid (AA) content attempts to offset the reduction in the nutrient density with increased feed intake was tested. In the experiment, feeds with a high or a low AA content were administrated to pigs fed &lt;i&gt;ad-libitum&lt;/i&gt; or restrictively according to a 2 × 2 factorial design. Ninety-six barrows were housed in 8 pens (12 pigs/pen) equipped with automatic feeders. Within pen, and from 47 body weight (BW) onwards, 6 pigs were fed &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt;. The others pigs were allowed to consume, as a maximum, the feed amounts indicated by the breeding company feeding plane to optimize the feed efficiency. In early (86–118 kg BW) and late (118–145 kg BW) finishing, the pigs of 4 pens received feeds with high indispensable AA contents (8.1 and 7.5 g lysine/kg in the two periods, respectively). The other pigs received feeds with reduced indispensable AA contents (lysine, methionine, threonine and tryptophan) by 9 and 18% in early and late finishing, respectively. Body lipid and protein (Pr) retentions were estimated from BW and back-fat depth measures recorded at the beginning and the end of each period. Nitrogen excretion was estimated as actual intake minus estimated N-retention (Pr/6.25). Pigs were slaughtered at 144 kg BW. Restricted feeding decreased feed intake (-7%), daily gain (-5%), carcass weight (-2.6%) and back-fat depth (-8.0%) but increased gain:feed ratio (+2%). The AA restriction increased feed intake (+5.9%), carcass weight (+4.9%) and intramuscular fat (+17.6%), and reduced carcass weight variation (-36%), with no effects on the feed efficiency and the estimated Pr (142 g/d). N excreted was reduced by feed (-9%) and dietary AA (-15%) restrictions. Irrespectively of the feeding level, the pigs responded to a reduction of the dietary essential AA content by increasing their feed intake.</description><updated>1522962000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>3</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195645</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195645</canonicalUrl><title>Effects of feed allowance and indispensable amino acid reduction on feed intake, growth performance and carcass characteristics of growing pigs</title><published>1522962000000</published><fingerprint>3de839a6</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefano Schiavon, Mirco Dalla Bona, Giuseppe Carcò, Luca Carraro, Lutz Bunger, Luigi Gallo&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine the factors associated with gait parameters in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The gait analysis was performed in a large cohort of RA patients, and three basic gait parameters (step length, cadence and gait speed) were calculated. Clinical and laboratory data were also collected. Factors associated with gait parameters were analyzed using multivariable linear regression in the three models with forced entry. Then, we divided those patients with Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ) scores ≤ 0.5 into two groups according to their gait speed that were compared to identify the characteristics of patients with a good HAQ score but poor walking ability.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 318 female patients were analyzed. Knee extension strength had the strongest positive association with all three gait parameters (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), while methotrexate use was also positively associated with all three gait parameters (step length: P &amp;lt; 0.05, cadence: P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 3, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01). The disease activity score was negatively associated with step length and gait speed (step length, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 3). 26% of patients with good HAQ scores showed slow gait speed. Patients with good HAQ scores and slow gait speed had higher disease activity scores (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and lower knee extension strength (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) than those with good HAQ scores and normal gait speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;High knee extension strength, low disease activity and administration of methotrexate were strongly associated with good walking ability in female patients with RA. And, even if patients showed good HAQ scores, about quarter of those patients had poor walking ability, and they showed higher disease activity, lower knee extension strength, compared to the patients with normal gait speed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><updated>1522184400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195059</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195059</canonicalUrl><title>Factors affecting walking ability in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis</title><published>1522184400000</published><fingerprint>2cc3d27f</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yugo Morita, Hiromu Ito, Mie Torii, Akiko Hanai, Moritoshi Furu, Motomu Hashimoto, Masao Tanaka, Masayuki Azukizawa, Hidenori Arai, Tsuneyo Mimori, Shuichi Matsuda&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Children with chronic health conditions may perform poorer at school. Associations may be confounded by numerous social factors. We aimed to estimate the effects of a chronic health condition on overall school performance in first graders with an emphasis on rigorous adjustment for potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A population-based cohort study was performed in the area of Mainz-Bingen (Germany). In 2015 all preschoolers were approached and the presence of a chronic health condition was assessed by parental questionnaires and preschool health examination data. The identification of a chronic health condition was based on special health care needs and presence of a doctor’s diagnosis out of 24 school-relevant diseases. At the end of the first school year, overall school performance was assessed by teachers and rated on a 5-item scale ranging from -10 to +10.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 3683 children approached, 2003 were enrolled. Overall school performance was available for 1462 children (51% boys). Of these, 52% suffered from a chronic health condition. Compared to children without a chronic health condition, children with special health care needs (15%) performed worse at school (adjusted mean difference: -0.95, 95% CI: [-1.55; -0.35], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). Children with a doctor’s diagnosis but without special health care needs (37%) did not perform worse at school. The effect was further analysed considering the extent of special health care needed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Chronic health conditions affect overall school performance early in primary school.

Academic misconduct/dishonesty has become widespread behavior among many university students across the globe, and medical education is not an exception. Until recently, few efforts have been made to study the dishonest behavior in Middle-Eastern universities. This study examined the prevalence and predisposing factors of cheating among medical students in Saudi Arabia and suggests suitable preventive measures. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at a government medical college during the 2014–2015 academic year. The response rate was 58.5% (421/720). The overall cheating behavior practiced by the participants was 29%, predominantly by male students. High GPA scoring students were the least likely to cheat.

Academic misconduct/dishonesty has become widespread behavior among many university students across the globe, and medical education is not an exception. Until recently, few efforts have been made to study the dishonest behavior in Middle-Eastern universities. This study examined the prevalence and predisposing factors of cheating among medical students in Saudi Arabia and suggests suitable preventive measures. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at a government medical college during the 2014–2015 academic year. The response rate was 58.5% (421/720). The overall cheating behavior practiced by the participants was 29%, predominantly by male students. High GPA scoring students were the least likely to cheat. The participants living with their families were more likely to cheat compared to those who were living apart from their families. The reasons participants gave to justify their cheating behavior included getting better grades, passing the course, and lacking preparation while still recognizing that cheating is a ‘mistake.’ Overall, significant academic misconduct concerning cheating was found among the Saudi medical students; this misconduct is alarming in a reputable government institution. The implementation of strict punishments, requiring ethical courses and creating ethical awareness by exploiting the potential of Islamic religious belief might help to control this problem.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Hamza Mohammad Abdulghani</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194963</link></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1628acdc610:9385a98:9f3b30f2</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23819-z</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23819-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23819-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/bylwsAoqO_4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23819-z</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/bylwsAoqO_4/s41598-018-23819-z</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522747164176</crawled><title>Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies</title><published>1522738800000</published><fingerprint>4cf58ae0</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23819-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23819-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/bylwsAoqO_4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Nicole H.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive weakness of the skeletal and cardiac muscles. This X-linked disorder is caused by open reading frame disrupting mutations in the DMD gene, resulting in strong reduction or complete absence of dystrophin protein. In order to use dystrophin as a supportive or even surrogate biomarker in clinical studies on investigational drugs aiming at correcting the primary cause of the disease, the ability to reliably quantify dystrophin expression in muscle biopsies of DMD patients pre- and post-treatment is essential. Here we demonstrate the application of the ProteinSimple capillary immunoassay (Wes) method, a gel- and blot-free method requiring less sample, antibody and time to run than conventional Western blot assay. We optimized dystrophin quantification by Wes using 2 different antibodies and found it to be highly sensitive, reproducible and quantitative over a large dynamic range. Using a healthy control muscle sample as a reference and α-actinin as a protein loading/muscle content control, a panel of skeletal muscle samples consisting of 31 healthy controls, 25 Becker Muscle dystrophy (BMD) and 17 DMD samples was subjected to Wes analysis. In healthy controls dystrophin levels varied 3 to 5-fold between the highest and lowest muscle samples, with the reference sample representing the average of all 31 samples. In BMD muscle samples dystrophin levels ranged from 10% to 90%, with an average of 33% of the healthy muscle average, while for the DMD samples the average dystrophin level was 1.3%, ranging from 0.7% to 7% of the healthy muscle average. In conclusion, Wes is a suitable, efficient and reliable method for quantification of dystrophin expression as a biomarker in DMD clinical drug development.</description><updated>1523480400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195850</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195850</canonicalUrl><title>Use of capillary Western immunoassay (Wes) for quantification of dystrophin levels in skeletal muscle of healthy controls and individuals with Becker and Duchenne muscular dystrophy</title><published>1523480400000</published><fingerprint>980c2f6c</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chantal Beekman, Anneke A.

The modulatory role of the primary motor cortex (M1), reflected by an inhibitory effect of M1-stimulation on clinical pain, motivated us to deepen our understanding of M1’s role in pain modulation. We used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)-induced virtual lesion (VL) to interrupt with M1 activity during noxious heat pain. We hypothesized that TMS-VL will effect experimental pain ratings. Three VL protocols were applied consisting of single-pulse TMS to transiently interfere with right M1 activity: (1) VL&lt;sub&gt;M1&lt;/sub&gt;- TMS applied to 11 subjects, 20 msec before the individual’s first pain-related M1 peak activation, as determined by source analysis (sLORETA), (2) VL&lt;sub&gt;-50&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 50 ms prior to noxious stimulus onset), and (3) VL&lt;sub&gt;+150&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 150 ms after noxious stimulus onset). Each protocol included 3 conditions (&apos;pain-alone&apos;, &apos; TMS-VL&apos;, and ‘SHAM-VL’), each consisted of 30 noxious heat stimuli. Pain ratings were compared, in each protocol, for TMS-VL vs. SHAM-VL and vs. pain-alone conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance, corrected for multiple comparisons revealed no significant differences in the pain ratings between the different conditions within each protocol. Therefore, our results from this exploratory study suggest that a single pulse TMS-induced VL that is targeted to M1 failed to interrupt experimental pain processing in the specific three stimulation timing examined here.</description><updated>1523307600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</href></item></alternate><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</canonicalUrl><title>Can a single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation targeted to the motor cortex interrupt pain processing?</title><published>1523307600000</published><fingerprint>228e14c4</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lee-Bareket Kisler, Ilan Gurion, Yelena Granovsky, Alon Sinai, Elliot Sprecher, Simone Shamay-Tsoory, Irit Weissman-Fogel&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The use of iodine-based contrast agents entails the risk of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Radiocontrast agents elicit the third most common cause of nephropathy among hospitalized patients, accounting for 11–12% of cases. CIN is connected with clinically significant consequences, including increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, increased risk of complications, potential need for dialysis, and increased mortality rate. The number of in-hospital examinations using iodine-based contrast media has been significantly increasing over the last decade. In order to protect patients from possible complications of such examinations, new biomarkers are needed that are able to predict a risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Urinary and plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations are influenced by renal function. Urinary cGMP is primarily of renal cellular origin. Therefore, we assessed if urinary cGMP concentration may predict major adverse renal events (MARE) after contrast media exposure during coronary angiography.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Urine samples were prospectively collected from non-randomized consecutive patients with either diabetes or preexisting impaired kidney function receiving intra-arterial contrast medium (CM) for emergent or elective coronary angiography at the Charité Campus Mitte, University Hospital Berlin.

Background &lt;p&gt;The use of iodine-based contrast agents entails the risk of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Radiocontrast agents elicit the third most common cause of nephropathy among hospitalized patients, accounting for 11–12% of cases. CIN is connected with clinically significant consequences, including increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, increased risk of complications, potential need for dialysis, and increased mortality rate. The number of in-hospital examinations using iodine-based contrast media has been significantly increasing over the last decade. In order to protect patients from possible complications of such examinations, new biomarkers are needed that are able to predict a risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Urinary and plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations are influenced by renal function. Urinary cGMP is primarily of renal cellular origin. Therefore, we assessed if urinary cGMP concentration may predict major adverse renal events (MARE) after contrast media exposure during coronary angiography.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Urine samples were prospectively collected from non-randomized consecutive patients with either diabetes or preexisting impaired kidney function receiving intra-arterial contrast medium (CM) for emergent or elective coronary angiography at the Charité Campus Mitte, University Hospital Berlin. Urinary cGMP concentration in spot urine was analyzed 24 hours after CM exposure. Patients were followed up over 90 days for occurrence of death, initiation of dialysis, doubling of plasma creatinine concentration or MARE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 289 consecutive patients were included into the study. Urine cGMP/creatinine ratio 24 hours before CM exposure expressed as mean±SD was predictive for the need of dialysis (no dialysis: 89.77±92.85 μM/mM, n = 277; need for dialysis: 140.3±82.90 μM/mM, n = 12, p = 0.008), death (no death during follow-up: 90.60±92.50 μM/mM, n = 280; death during follow-up: 169.88±81.52 μM/mM, n = 9; p = 0.002), and the composite endpoint MARE (no MARE: 86.02±93.17 μM/mM, n = 271; MARE: 146.64±74.68 μM/mM, n = 18, p&amp;lt;0.001) during the follow-up of 90 days after contrast media application. cGMP/creatinine ratio stayed significantly increased at values exceeding 120 μM/mM in patients who developed MARE, required dialysis or died.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Urinary cGMP/creatinine ratio ≥ 120 μM/mM before CM exposure is a promising biomarker for the need of dialysis and all-cause mortality 90 days after CM exposure in patients with preexisting renal impairment or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Lyubov Chaykovska</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195828</link></item><item><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_162bbae32b8:c5e60:bdf8aaf1</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00357</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00357/20180412/images/medium/bi-2018-00357u_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00357&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The prevalence of stunting among children below 5 years of age is higher in the slum-dwelling population of Bangladesh compared to that in both urban and rural areas. Studies have reported that several factors such as inadequate nutrition, low socio-economic status, poor hygiene and sanitation and lack of maternal education are the substantial predictors of childhood stunting. Almost all these factors are universally present in the slum-dwelling population of Bangladesh. However, few studies have prospectively examined such determinants of stunting among slum populations. In this paper, we reveal the findings of a cohort study with an aim to explore the status of micronutrient adequacy among such vulnerable children and establish its association with stunting along with other determinants. Two-hundred-sixty-five children were enrolled and followed since birth until 24 months of age. We collected anthropometric, morbidity and dietary intake data monthly. We used the 24-hour multiple-pass recall approach to collect dietary intake data from the age of 9 months onward. Micronutrient adequacy of the diet was determined by the mean adequacy ratio (MAR) which was constructed from the average intake of 9 vitamins and 4 minerals considered for the analysis. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models to establish the determinants of stunting between 12–24 months of age in our study population. The prevalence of low-birth-weight (LBW) was about 28.7% and approximately half of the children were stunted by the age of 24 months. The average micronutrient intake was considerably lower than the recommended dietary allowance and the MAR was only 0.48 at 24 months of age compared to the optimum value of 1. However, the MAR was not associated with stunting between 12–24 months of age. Rather, LBW was the significant determinant (AOR = 3.03, 95% CI: 1.69–5.44) after adjusting for other factors such as age (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.45–3.11 at 24 months and AOR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.49–2.59 at 18 months, ref: 12 months) and sex (AOR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.17–3.33, ref: female). Improving the nutritional quality of complementary food in terms of adequacy of micronutrients is imperative for optimum growth but may not be adequate to mitigate under-nutrition in this setting. Further research should focus on identifying multiple strategies that can work synergistically to diminish the burden of stunting in resource-poor settings.</description><updated>1522357200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195072</href></item></alternate><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195072</canonicalUrl><title>Micronutrient adequacy is poor, but not associated with stunting between 12-24 months of age: A cohort study findings from a slum area of Bangladesh</title><published>1522357200000</published><fingerprint>459b9215</fingerprint><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kazi Istiaque Sanin, M.
