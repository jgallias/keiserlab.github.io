From 2006 to 2013, an increasing incidence of fusariosis was observed in the hematologic patients of our University Hospital. We suspected of an environmental source, and the indoor hospital air was investigated as a potential source of the fungemia. Air samplings were performed in the hematology and bone marrow transplant (BMT) wards using an air sampler with pre-defined air volumes. To study the molecular relationship among environmental and clinical isolates, 18 &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; spp. recovered from blood cultures were included in the study. DNA sequencing of a partial portion of &lt;i&gt;TEF1α&lt;/i&gt; gene was performed for molecular identification. Molecular typing was carried out by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) using a four-gene scheme: &lt;i&gt;TEF1α&lt;/i&gt;, rDNA, &lt;i&gt;RPB1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RPB2&lt;/i&gt;. One hundred four isolates were recovered from the air of the hematology (n = 76) and the BMT (n = 28) wards. &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; isolates from the air were from five species complexes: &lt;i&gt;Fusarium fujikuroi&lt;/i&gt; (FFSC, n = 56), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti&lt;/i&gt; (FIESC, n = 24), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium solani&lt;/i&gt; (FSSC, n = 13), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium chlamydosporum&lt;/i&gt; (FCSC, n = 10), and &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; (FOSC, n = 1). Fifteen &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from blood belonged to FSSC, and three to FFSC. MLST identified the same sequence type (ST) in clinical and environmental isolates. ST1 was found in 5 isolates from blood and in 7 from the air, both identified as FSSC (&lt;i&gt;Fusarium petroliphilum&lt;/i&gt;). STn1 was found in one isolate from blood and in one from the air, both identified as FFSC (&lt;i&gt;Fusarium napiforme&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;napiforme&lt;/i&gt; was isolated from the air of the hospital room of the patient with fungemia due to &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;napiforme&lt;/i&gt;. These findings suggested a possible clonal origin of the &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; spp. recovered from air and bloodcultures.

The conversion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show a maximum &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) crystals out of plane. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe crystals is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe crystals with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport).

The conversion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show a maximum &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) crystals out of plane. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe crystals is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe crystals with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport). A continuous phase transition increases the symmetry and diverges two converged conduction bands. These two factors improve carrier mobility, while preserving a large Seebeck coefficient.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In light of the limited impact the syndromic management approach has had on the global sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic, we assessed a care model comprising point-of-care (POC) STI testing, immediate treatment, and expedited partner therapy (EPT) among a cohort of young women at high HIV risk in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;HIV negative women presenting for STI care underwent POC testing for &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT), &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; (NG) and &lt;i&gt;Trichomonas vaginalis&lt;/i&gt; (TV), and swabs were sent for NG culture and susceptibility testing. Results were available within 2 hours and women with STIs were immediately treated and offered EPT packs, including medication, condoms, and information for sexual partners. An EPT questionnaire was administered after one week, and women retested for STIs after 6 and 12 weeks. 267 women, median age 23 (IQR 21–26), were recruited and 88.4% (236/267) reported genital symptoms. STI prevalence was CT 18.4% (95%CI 13.7–23.0), NG 5.2% (95%CI 2.6–7.9) and TV 3.0% (95%CI 1.0–5.0). After 12 weeks, all but one NG and two CT infections were cleared. No cephalosporin-resistant NG was detected. Of 63/267 women (23.6%) diagnosed with STIs, 98.4% (62/63) were offered and 87.1% (54/62) accepted EPT. At one week 88.9% (48/54) stated that their partner had taken the medication. No allergic reactions or social harms were reported.

One of the most ambitious endeavors in the field of diabetes technology is non-invasive glucose sensing. In the past decades, a number of different technologies have been assessed, but none of these have found its entry into general clinical use. We report on the development of a table-top confocal Raman spectrometer that was used in the home of patients with diabetes and operated for extended periods of time unsupervised and without recalibration. The system is based on measurement of glucose levels at a ‘critical depth’ in the skin, specifically in the interstitial fluid located below the stratum corneum but above the underlying adipose tissue layer. The region chosen for routine glucose measurements was the base of the thumb (the thenar). In a small clinical study, 35 patients with diabetes analyzed their interstitial fluid glucose for a period of 60 days using the new critical-depth Raman (CD-Raman) method and levels were correlated to reference capillary blood glucose values using a standard finger-stick and test strip product. The calibration of the CD-Raman system was stable for &gt; 10 days. Measurement performance for glucose levels present at, or below, a depth of ~250μm below the skin surface was comparable to that reported for currently available invasive continuous glucose monitors. In summary, using the CD-Raman technology we have demonstrated the first successful use of a non-invasive glucose monitor in the home.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f78:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526072400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Signe M.

In recent years, two-photon calcium imaging has become a standard tool to probe the function of neural circuits and to study computations in neuronal populations. However, the acquired signal is only an indirect measurement of neural activity due to the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent calcium indicators. Different algorithms for estimating spike rates from noisy calcium measurements have been proposed in the past, but it is an open question how far performance can be improved. Here, we report the results of the &lt;i&gt;spikefinder&lt;/i&gt; challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike rate inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity. The competition shows that benchmark challenges can drive algorithmic developments in neuroscience.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a1WS4uygAIc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16383cd4876:d8bafa:abeb7260</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526936400000</published><recrawled>1526935325513</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Berens, Jeremy Freeman, Thomas Deneux, Nicolay Chenkov, Thomas McColgan, Artur Speiser, Jakob H.

&lt;i&gt;Deltoblastus batheri&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Deltoblastus delta&lt;/i&gt; occur concurrently in many Permian deposits from Timor. Closely related sister species living in direct proximity without alteration in feeding habit would be in direct violation of Lotka-Volterra dynamics. These two species were measured and compared to see if any evidence of differentiation along feeding lines has occurred in order to reduce direct competition. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-values obtained via Student’s t test display significant differentiation across all measured parameters. Thin-plate splines were used to visualize these differences, and clearly show the differences which are focused on the ambulacral region of the blastoids, which are the primary food gathering point for these species.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7bc:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526504400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryan FitzGerald Morgan&lt;/p&gt;

Thin-plate splines were used to visualize these differences, and clearly show the differences which are focused on the ambulacral region of the blastoids, which are the primary food gathering point for these species.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197512</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>34bcf482</fingerprint><title>Niche partitioning as a mechanism for locally high species diversity within a geographically limited genus of blastoid</title><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><updated>1526504400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Ryan FitzGerald Morgan</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197512</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197512</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197512</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163405ce4f5:39c5c1:93d646dc</id><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525667421000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/17&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>93fd64aa</fingerprint><title>High-density equation of state for a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones solid</title><crawled>1525793219829</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Kaihang Shi</name></author><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029488?af=R</link><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029488?af=R</originId><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029488?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leanne G.

Plant leaves of different ages differ in nutrients and toxic metabolites and thus exhibit various resistance levels against insect herbivores. However, little is known about the influence of leaf ontogeny on plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects. In this study, we found that the green peach aphid, &lt;i&gt;Myzus persicae&lt;/i&gt;, preferred to settle on young cabbage leaves compared with mature or old leaves, although young leaves contained the highest concentration of glucosinolates. Furthermore, aphids feeding on young leaves had higher levels of glucosinolates in their body, but aphids performed better on young leaves in terms of body weight and population growth. Phloem sap of young leaves had higher amino acid:sugar molar ratio than mature leaves, and aphids feeding on young leaves showed two times longer phloem feeding time and five times more honeydew excretion than on other leaves. These results indicate that aphids acquired the highest amount of nutrients and defensive metabolites when feeding on young cabbage leaves that are strong natural plant sinks. Accordingly, we propose that aphids generally prefer to obtain more nutrition rather than avoiding host plant defense, and total amount of nutrition that aphids could obtain is significantly influenced by leaf ontogeny or source-sink status of feeding sites.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb9b:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524517200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by He-He Cao, Zhan-Feng Zhang, Xiao-Feng Wang, Tong-Xian Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Nitrogen assimilation and metabolism are essential processes for all living organisms, yet there is still much to be learnt on how they are regulated. The use of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; as a model system has been instrumental not only in identifying conserved regulation mechanisms that control the nitrogen assimilation pathway, but also in understanding how the intracellular nitrogen status regulates metabolic processes of industrial interest such as the synthesis of biolipids. While the genetic regulators that control the nitrogen pathway are successfully being unravelled, other layers of regulation have received less attention. Amino acids, for example, regulate nitrogen assimilation in certain organisms, but their role in Chlamydomonas has not thoroughly been explored. Previous results had suggested that arginine might repress key genes of the nitrogen assimilation pathway by acting within the ammonium negative signalling cascade, upstream of the nitric oxide (NO) inducible guanylate cyclase &lt;i&gt;CYG56&lt;/i&gt;. We tested this hypothesis with a combination of genetic and chemical approaches. Antagonising the effects of arginine with an arginine biosynthesis mutant or with two chemical analogues released gene expression from ammonium mediated repression. The &lt;i&gt;cyg56&lt;/i&gt; and related &lt;i&gt;non1&lt;/i&gt; mutants, which are partially insensitive to ammonium repression, were also partially insensitive to repression by arginine. Finally, we show that the addition of arginine to the medium leads to an increase in intracellular NO. Our data reveal that arginine acts as a negative signal for the assimilation of nitrogen within the ammonium-CYG56 negative signalling cascade, and provide a connection between amino acid metabolism and nitrogen assimilation in microalgae.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb99:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524517200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by David González-Ballester, Emanuel Sanz-Luque, Aurora Galván, Emilio Fernández, Amaury de Montaigu&lt;/p&gt;

We find that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity depends on the pathogen and both protection and morbidity do not always increase with increasing inoculum dose. An intermediate inoculum dose can provide the best balance between immune protection and morbidity, though this depends on the specific weighting of protection and morbidity.

The HIV-1 nucleocapsid 7 (NCp7) plays crucial roles in multiple stages of HIV-1 life cycle, and its biological functions rely on the binding of zinc ions. Understanding the molecular mechanism of how the zinc ions modulate the conformational dynamics and functions of the NCp7 is essential for the drug development and HIV-1 treatment. In this work, using a structure-based coarse-grained model, we studied the effects of zinc cofactors on the folding and target RNA(SL3) recognition of the NCp7 by molecular dynamics simulations. After reproducing some key properties of the zinc binding and folding of the NCp7 observed in previous experiments, our simulations revealed several interesting features in the metal ion modulated folding and target recognition. Firstly, we showed that the zinc binding makes the folding transition states of the two zinc fingers less structured, which is in line with the Hammond effect observed typically in mutation, temperature or denaturant induced perturbations to protein structure and stability. Secondly, We showed that there exists mutual interplay between the zinc ion binding and NCp7-target recognition. Binding of zinc ions enhances the affinity between the NCp7 and the target RNA, whereas the formation of the NCp7-RNA complex reshapes the intrinsic energy landscape of the NCp7 and increases the stability and zinc affinity of the two zinc fingers. Thirdly, by characterizing the effects of salt concentrations on the target RNA recognition, we showed that the NCp7 achieves optimal balance between the affinity and binding kinetics near the physiologically relevant salt concentrations. In addition, the effects of zinc binding on the inter-domain conformational flexibility and folding cooperativity of the NCp7 were also discussed.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a65:11c251fd</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525208400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Weitong Ren, Dongqing Ji, Xiulian Xu&lt;/p&gt;

Stressor-exposure has been shown to exacerbate inflammation and change the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota; however stressor-induced effects on microbiota-derived metabolites and their receptors are unknown. Thus, bacterial-produced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as microbial community composition, were assessed in the colons of mice exposed to stress during infection with &lt;i&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/i&gt;. Mice were exposed to overnight restraint on 7 consecutive nights, or left undisturbed as a control. After the first exposure of restraint, mice were orally challenged with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt; or with vehicle. Microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SCFA levels measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Pathogen levels and colonic inflammation were also assessed 6 days post-infection. Results demonstrated that the microbial community structure and SCFA production were significantly affected by both stressor exposure and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt;-infection. Exposure to prolonged restraint in the absence of infection significantly reduced SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid). Multiple bacterial taxa were affected by stressor exposure, with the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; being significantly reduced and directly correlated with propionic acid. &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; abundances were inversely correlated with colonic inflammation, supporting the contention that &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; helps to regulate mucosal inflammatory responses. Our data indicates that restraint stressor can have significant effects on pathogen-induced colonic inflammation and suggest that stressor-induced changes in the microbiota, microbial-produced SCFAs and their receptors may be involved.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed7:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525899600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ross M.

Aim &lt;p&gt;To determine choroidal thickness in healthy Indian subjects using Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective, observational, cross-sectional study; healthy Indian subjects (n = 230) with no history of ocular and/or systemic disorders were enrolled in the study. Choroidal thickness was measured for 230 eyes using SS-OCT. Subjects were divided into six age groups. Main outcome measures were subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and macular choroidal thickness (MCT) up to 3 mm at 500-micron interval from the fovea was measured in eight different quadrants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean SFCT was 307±79 μm and mean MCT was 285±75 μm. No difference in the choroidal thickness was found among genders. Mean SFCT of the different age groups was 327±68 μm (12–18 years), 364±70 μm (18.1–30 years), 321±78 μm (30.1–40 years), 304±79 μm (40.1–50 years), 283±69 μm (50.1–60 years) and 262±72μm (above 60 years; p &amp;lt;0.001; One way ANOVA). Mean macular choroidal thickness was 305±60 μm, 342±61 μm, 306±72 μm, 282±79 μm, 261±66 μm, 238±68μm respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001; one way ANOVA). A significant weak negative correlation was found between age with SFCT (r = -0.368, p&amp;lt;0.001) and MCT (r = -0.40, p&amp;lt;0.001). No significant correlation was found with refractive error, axial length and ocular perfusion pressure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that mean SFCT and MCT was 307±79μm and 285±75 μm, respectively, among healthy Indian subjects. Mean CT was found to decrease with age, although there was no difference in CT between genders.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a1c04be:41f7c58:3dd877af</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526504400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zeeshan Akhtar, Pukhraj Rishi, Ramasubramanian Srikanth, Ekta Rishi, Muna Bhende, Rajiv Raman&lt;/p&gt;

The stolbur phytoplasma vector &lt;i&gt;Hyalesthes obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; is generally considered as a polyphagous species associated with numerous wild and cultivated plants. However, recent research in southeastern Europe, the distribution centre of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; and the area of most stolbur-inflicted crop diseases, points toward specific host-plant associations of the vector, indicating specific vector-based transmission routes. Here, we study the specificity of populations associated with four host-plants using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers, and we evaluate the evolution of host-shifts in &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt;.

In the United States (US), the sugarcane aphid (SCA) &lt;i&gt;Melanaphis sacchari&lt;/i&gt; (Zehnter) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was introduced in the 1970s, however at that time it was only considered a pest of sugarcane. In 2013, a massive outbreak of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sacchari&lt;/i&gt; occured on sorghum, resulting in significant economic damage to sorghum grown in North America including the US, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The aim of the present study was to determine if the SCA pest emergence in American sorghum resulted from the introduction of new genotypes. To this end we used microsatellite markers and COI sequencing to compare the genetic diversity of SCA populations collected in the Americas after the 2013 SCA outbreak on sorghum (during 2013–2017) to older samples collected before the pest outbreak (during 2007–2009). Our results show that the SCA outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean observed since 2013 belong to populations exhibiting low genetic diversity and consisting of a dominant clonal lineage, MLL-F, which colonizes &lt;i&gt;Sorghum&lt;/i&gt; spp. and sugarcane. The comparison of MLL-F specimens collected post-2013 with specimens collected in Louisiana in 2007 revealed that both populations are genetically distinct, according to COI sequencing and microsatellite data analyses. Our result suggest that MLL-F is a new invasive genotype introduced into the Americas that has spread rapidly across sorghum growing regions in the US, Mexico, Honduras and the Caribbean. The origin of this introduction is either Africa or Asia, with Asia being the most probable source.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b0:91749e5b</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524690000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Nibouche, Laurent Costet, Jocelyn R.

The circuit organization within the mammalian brainstem respiratory network, specifically within and between the pre-Bötzinger (pre-BötC) and Bötzinger (BötC) complexes, and the roles of these circuits in respiratory pattern generation are continuously debated. We address these issues with a combination of optogenetic experiments and modeling studies. We used transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 under the VGAT-promoter to investigate perturbations of respiratory circuit activity by site-specific photostimulation of inhibitory neurons within the pre-BötC or BötC. The stimulation effects were dependent on the intensity and phase of the photostimulation. Specifically: (1) Low intensity (≤ 1.0 mW) pulses delivered to the pre-BötC during inspiration did not terminate activity, whereas stronger stimulations (≥ 2.0 mW) terminated inspiration. (2) When the pre-BötC stimulation ended in or was applied during expiration, rebound activation of inspiration occurred after a fixed latency. (3) Relatively weak sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–2.0 mW) of pre-BötC inhibitory neurons increased respiratory frequency, while a further increase of stimulus intensity (&gt; 3.0 mW) reduced frequency and finally (≥ 5.0 mW) terminated respiratory oscillations. (4) Single pulses (0.2–5.0 s) applied to the BötC inhibited rhythmic activity for the duration of the stimulation. (5) Sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–3.0 mW) of the BötC reduced respiratory frequency and finally led to apnea. We have revised our computational model of pre-BötC and BötC microcircuits by incorporating an additional population of post-inspiratory inhibitory neurons in the pre-BötC that interacts with other neurons in the network. This model was able to reproduce the above experimental findings as well as previously published results of optogenetic activation of pre-BötC or BötC neurons obtained by other laboratories. The proposed organization of pre-BötC and BötC circuits leads to testable predictions about their specific roles in respiratory pattern generation and provides important insights into key circuit interactions operating within brainstem respiratory networks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2-EXg_xghbA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163032286b6:a8a5f:ed160cc3</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524776400000</published><recrawled>1524775327424</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica Ausborn, Hidehiko Koizumi, William H.

The proposed organization of pre-BötC and BötC circuits leads to testable predictions about their specific roles in respiratory pattern generation and provides important insights into key circuit interactions operating within brainstem respiratory networks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2-EXg_xghbA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><engagement>1</engagement><fingerprint>3c9cd4af</fingerprint><author><name>Jessica Ausborn</name></author><crawled>1524765984438</crawled><updated>1524776400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Organization of the core respiratory network: Insights from optogenetic and modeling studies</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006148</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006148</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006148</originId><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2-EXg_xghbA/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tim Rahmel, Simon T.

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is now operationally defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an infection, identified by an acute change in SOFA-Score of at least two points, including clinical chemistry such as creatinine or bilirubin concentrations. However, little knowledge exists about organ-specific microRNAs as potentially new biomarkers. Accordingly, we tested the hypotheses that micro-RNA-122, the foremost liver-related micro-RNA (miR), 1) discriminates between sepsis and infection, 2) is an early predictor for mortality, and 3) improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-score.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed 108 patients with sepsis (infection + increase SOFA-Score ≥2) within the first 24h of ICU admission and as controls 20 patients with infections without sepsis (infection + SOFA-Score ≤1). Total circulating miR was isolated from serum and relative miR-122 expression was measured (using spiked-in cel-miR-54) and associated with 30-day survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;30-day survival of the sepsis patients was 63%. miR-122 expression was 40-fold higher in non-survivors (p = 0.001) and increased almost 6-fold in survivors (p = 0.013) compared to controls. miR-122 serum-expression discriminated both between sepsis vs. infection (AUC 0.760, sensitivity 58.3%, specificity 95%) and survivors vs. non-survivors (AUC 0.728, sensitivity 42.5%, specificity 94%). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed miR-122 (HR 4.3; 95%-CI 2.0–8.9, p&amp;lt;0.001) as independent prognostic factor for 30-day mortality. Furthermore, the predictive value for 30-day mortality of the SOFA-Score (AUC 0.668) was improved by adding miR-122 (AUC 0.743; net reclassification improvement 0.37, p&amp;lt;0.001; integrated discrimination improvement 0.07, p = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Increased miR-122 serum concentration supports the discrimination between infection and sepsis, is an early and independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, and improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-Score, suggesting a potential role for miR-122 in sepsis-related prediction models.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761235:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526936400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tim Rahmel, Simon T.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether stopping the effective antibiotic treatment following clinical improvement at Day 7 (Truncated treatment) would be non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 (Continued treatment) in patients with acute pyelonephritis (APN) requiring hospitalization treated with non-fluoroquinolone (non-FQ) antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Hospitalized adult men and non-pregnant women with culture-confirmed APN were eligible for participation after they had clinically improved following empirical or culture-guided treatment with intravenous non-FQ antibiotic(s). We excluded patients with severe sepsis, abscesses, prostatitis, recurrent or catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or urinary tract obstruction. We randomized eligible patients on Day 7 of effective treatment and assessed them at Weeks 1 and 6 after treatment completion. The primary outcome was retreatment for recurrent urinary tract infection. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 15%.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 17, 2015 and August 22, 2016, we randomly allocated 54 patients—27 patients in each arm. Twenty-four (44%) patients were male, and 26 (48%) had diabetes mellitus. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was the most common urinary isolate (47 [87%] patients); 36 (78%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In all, 41 (76%) patients received amikacin-based treatment. At the end of 6 weeks, no patient in the truncated treatment arm required retreatment, whereas 1 patient in the continued treatment arm was retreated. Difference (90% CI) in retreatment was −3.7% (−15.01% to 6.15%). Upper bound of the difference (6.15%) was below the prespecified limit, establishing non-inferiority of truncated treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria at Week 6 was similar between the two arms (3/24 vs. 3/26; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.0). Patients in the truncated treatment arm had significantly shorter hospital stay (8 [7–10] vs. 14 [14–15] days; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and less antibiotic consumption per patient (8.4 ± 2.8 vs. 17.4 ± 8.3 DDDs; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Stopping the effective non-FQ antibiotics following clinical improvement at Day 7 is non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 in selected patients with APN requiring hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;Clinical Trials Registry-India; CTRI/2016/04/006810.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b0:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526504400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pavankumar Rudrabhatla, Surendran Deepanjali, Jharna Mandal, Rathinam Palamalai Swaminathan, Tamilarasu Kadhiravan&lt;/p&gt;

Monocyte-like cell lines (MCLCs), including THP-1, HL-60 and U-937 cells, are used routinely as surrogates for isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To systematically evaluate these immortalised cells and PBMCs as model systems to study inflammation relevant to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes and immuno-metabolism, we compared mRNA expression of inflammation-relevant genes, cell surface expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers, and chemotactic responses to inflammatory stimuli. Messenger RNA expression analysis suggested most genes were present at similar levels across all undifferentiated cells, though notably, &lt;i&gt;IDO1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes for indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and catabolises tryptophan to kynureninase (shown to be elevated in serum from diabetic patients), was not expressed in any PMA-treated MCLC, but present in GM-CSF-treated PBMCs. There was little overall difference in the pattern of expression of CD markers across all cells, though absolute expression levels varied considerably and the correlation between MCLCs and PBMCs was improved upon MCLC differentiation. Functionally, THP-1 and PBMCs migrated in response to chemoattractants in a transwell assay, with varying sensitivity to MCP-1, MIP-1α and LTB-4. However, despite similar gene and CD expression profiles, U-937 cells were functionally impaired as no migration was observed to any chemoattractant. Our analysis reveals that the MCLCs examined only partly replicate the genotypic and phenotypic properties of human PBMCs. To overcome such issues a universal differentiation protocol should be implemented for these cell lines, similar to those already used with isolated monocytes. Although not perfect, in our hands the THP-1 cells represent the closest, simplified surrogate model of PBMCs for study of inflammatory cell migration.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559156:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525986000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Darren M.

A growing literature has been developed demonstrating the clinical relevance of a biomathematical model, the Proliferation-Invasion (PI) model, of glioblastoma growth. Of interest here is the development of a treatment response metric, Days Gained (DG). This metric is based on individual tumor kinetics estimated through segmented volumes of hyperintense regions on T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced (T1Gd) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs). This metric was shown to be prognostic of time to progression. Further, it was shown to be more prognostic of outcome than standard response metrics. While promising, the original paper did not account for uncertainty in the calculation of the DG metric leaving the robustness of this cutoff in question. We harness the Bayesian framework to consider the impact of two sources of uncertainty: 1) image acquisition and 2) interobserver error in image segmentation. We first utilize synthetic data to characterize what non-error variants are influencing the final uncertainty in the DG metric. We then consider the original patient cohort to investigate clinical patterns of uncertainty and to determine how robust this metric is for predicting time to progression and overall survival. Our results indicate that the key clinical variants are the time between pre-treatment images and the underlying tumor growth kinetics, matching our observations in the clinical cohort. Finally, we demonstrated that for this cohort there was a continuous range of cutoffs between 94 and 105 for which the prediction of the time to progression and was over 80\% reliable.

The most popular visualization method for scRNA-seq is t-Stochastic Neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which accurately captures the local structure of datasets, but often distorts global structure, such as distances between clusters. We developed a method for visualization and interpretation of scRNA-seq datasets, Similarity Weighted Nonnegative Embedding (SWNE), which captures both the global and local structure of the data, and embeds biological information directly onto the visualization. SWNE uses nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to decompose the gene expression matrix into biologically relevant factors, embeds both the cells and the factors in a two dimensional visualization, and uses a similarity matrix to ensure that cells which are close in the original gene expression space are also close in the visualization. SWNE can also embed genes onto the visualization directly, while the embedded biological factors can be interpreted via their gene loadings, enhancing biological interpretatability. We demonstrate SWNE&apos;s ability to visualize and facilitate interpretation of hematopoietic progenitors and cells from the human visual cortex and cerebellum.

We demonstrate SWNE&apos;s ability to visualize and facilitate interpretation of hematopoietic progenitors and cells from the human visual cortex and cerebellum.

Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power–integrated information (Φ), and showing that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to “beat” the micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for Φ across different spatial and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible &lt;i&gt;black boxes&lt;/i&gt;. These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of Φ across several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nmwWC-o9ix4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162f3a6e287:392bb:a077e55f</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524517200000</published><recrawled>1524516127247</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by William Marshall, Larissa Albantakis, Giulio Tononi&lt;/p&gt;

A consistent determinant of the establishment success of alien species appears to be the number of individuals that are introduced to found a population (propagule pressure), yet variation in the form of this relationship has been largely unexplored. Here, we present the first quantitative systematic review of this form, using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. The relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success has been evaluated for a broad range of taxa and life histories, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants and long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. We found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success to be a feature of every hypothesis we tested. However, establishment success most critically depended on propagule pressures in the range of 10–100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated primarily with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. Conversely, no variation was accounted for in any analysis by the scale of study (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy) used. Our analyses reveal remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien population establishment success.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7aUJblC5EI4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f3ad5b12:38e8b5:76251cdd</id><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524517200000</published><recrawled>1525453924895</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Phillip Cassey, Steven Delean, Julie L.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Objective was to examine the temporal variation of HIV sero-discordancy in select representative countries (Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Niger, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe) in sub-Saharan Africa at different HIV epidemic scales. A sero-discordant couple is defined as a stable couple (SC) in which one partner is HIV-positive while the other is HIV-negative.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A deterministic compartmental mathematical model was constructed to describe HIV transmission dynamics. The model was pair-based, that is explicitly modeling formation of SCs and infection dynamics in both SCs and in single individuals. The model accommodated for different forms of infection statuses in SCs. Using population-based nationally-representative epidemiologic and demographic input data, historical (1980–2014) and future (2015–2030) trends of sero-discordancy and other demographic and epidemiologic indicators were projected throughout HIV epidemic phases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;As the epidemics emerged, about 90% of SCs affected by HIV were sero-discordant. This proportion declined to 45%-88% at epidemic peak and stabilized as the epidemics started their natural decline. The largest reductions in sero-discordancy were in high HIV-prevalence countries. As the epidemics further declined with antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up, the proportion of sero-discordant couples among HIV-affected couples was projected to increase to 70%-92% by 2030. The proportion of sero-discordant couples among all SCs increased as the epidemics emerged and evolved, then peaked at 2%-20% as the epidemics peaked, and then declined as the epidemics declined to reach 0.3%-16% by 2030.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sero-discordancy patterns varied with the evolution of the epidemics, and were affected by both epidemic phase and scale. The largest variations were found in high HIV-prevalence countries. The fraction of stable couples that are sero-discordant, as opposed to being sero-concordant positive, was projected to increase with ART scale-up and further HIV incidence decline over the coming two decades. These findings inform strategic planning and resource allocation for interventions among sero-discordant couples.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e53:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525122000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne F.

These findings inform strategic planning and resource allocation for interventions among sero-discordant couples.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196613</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>f79e9a8</fingerprint><title>Temporal evolution of HIV sero-discordancy patterns among stable couples in sub-Saharan Africa</title><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Susanne F.

Med. Chem. on “&lt;em&gt;What Makes a Great Medicinal Chemist&lt;/em&gt;“. As he makes clear from the beginning, if you’ve been doing this stuff for a while, you’ve likely heard many of these recommendations before. But it’s useful for people starting out, and it’s also useful for organization to think about what they’re encouraging (and what they’re not!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several characteristics common to good scientists in general – paraphrasing, we have: (1) intellectual curiosity, (2) ability to focus on the problem at hand, (3) pragmatic approach to problem-solving, (4) respect for data, (5) attention to detail, (6) sense of urgency, (7) awareness of other work in the field, (8) openness to new technologies (once they’ve proved their utility!), (9) willingness to challenge assumptions and ditch old ones, (10) enjoyment of their work, (11) awareness of the limits of their knowledge, (12) resiliency, (13) effective at communication, (14) working well with team members (there are exceptions!), (15) not constantly seeking credit, and (16) looking for mentors early on, and serving as one later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past that, he has traits that are more specific to medicinal chemists: (17) never losing sight of the final drug profile, (18) the ability to come up with unusual structural ideas when needed, (19) attention to more than just potency, (20) three-dimensional thinking, (21) awareness of the need for different chemical series/scaffolds, (22) awareness of the competition, but not being scared of IP space, (23) never giving on validated targets, since they’re rare, (24) a deep understanding of biology, (25) decisiveness about what the next steps in a project should be, (26) being unafraid of tough chemistry (in a good cause), (27) a willingness to repurpose anything (in a good cause), and (28) awareness of the history of the field and its current state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s quite a list! And it should be clear at the outset that you’re not going to find people – or not too many – who have all those qualities turned up to 11. But they’re all useful and important, and it’s worth looking over them to see what your strengths are (and especially what you might need to shore up a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few comments on specific items: I think that (3), (9), and (27) are aspects of the same approach to applied research – that is, a willingness to go with what works, even if it isn’t your idea, even if it disproves your favorite assumptions, even if it seems weird or even if it seems obvious or old. Things that work, that really work, are the ace cards in the deck. Solid experimental evidence brushes aside feelings, theories, and assumptions (quality 4 above ), and you have to be ready to come to terms with it and figure out where it’s telling you to go next (quality 25). A corollary is that if you’re running experiments whose results are not going to be solid or important enough for you to base such decisions on, then why? We’ve all sat in meetings where someone outlines an experiment that (if it works) means the project goes on as planned. But if it doesn’t work? Then. . .the project goes on as planned anyway. It’s hard to see how that’s not, at some level, a waste of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also has a connection with (11), knowing what you don’t know. There are mistakes at both ends of the scale (there always are), and in this case it’s being too tentative or being too confident. Chemists, in my experience, are more prone to the latter, the mistake the Greeks called &lt;em&gt;hubris&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone who’s honest with themselves about biomedical research has to admit that most of the time, about most things, we can only aspire to the level of actually knowing jack diddley. What really causes Alzheimer’s? What are the specific neuronal processes involved in consciousness? What’s the specific molecular process you’d need to hit to stop multiple sclerosis or lupus? On a more immediate level, why does Compound Series A get into cells while Compound Series B doesn’t? What do I need to do to the lead compound to make it about two times more potent at the target? Or about ten times less potent at that other target it’s hitting? What other targets is the thing hitting, anyway? And so on. Decision-making under these conditions is. . .nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why many of the desirable qualities above can in fact work against each other, if taken to extremes or misapplied. Attention to detail is important – but not to the point where you become unable to make a call because you can think of bad consequences every way you turn. Ability to focus is important, but not if it leads to glossing over key experimental data that are trying to tell you something. Mistakes at both ends of the scale!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(24), understanding of biology, deserves some comment. My feeling is that not many people from other fields tend to know much about organic or medicinal chemistry, nor do they seem particularly eager to learn. So we chemists have a real advantage, knowing this stuff already, but you can’t rest on that advantage, either. The point is to start from there and &lt;em&gt;go learn about the other stuff&lt;/em&gt;. You can be useful as a chemist (at an entry-level position) without knowing much about the biology involved – just bang out compounds. But you cannot be really good at the job with that approach, nor (as time goes on) will you continue to be as valuable to your employer – or any other employer. The chemistry is just a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quality worth noting is (12), resilience. A constant feature of drug research is that most things, most of the time, don’t work that well. Your ideas about improving the compounds? By golly, here come the assay data, and it’s back to the bench we go. You have to be ready for your best ideas, your biggest bolts of inspiration, to land in a tangled heap over and over. It takes getting used to, and some personality types are just not suited to it. Longterm med-chemists exhibit survivorship bias; they’re the ones who have been able to deal, but not everyone can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been focusing on individual behavior, but as mentioned above, there’s something to be said about organizations, too. Managers of all types should think about whether their labs, departments, or companies are providing a good home for these behaviors or not. Be honest. I’m not talking about wall posters, e-mail newsletters, or “State of the Company” speeches. Your mission statement might say that you’re committed to innovation or something, but talk is as cheap as it’s ever been. For employees looking at their own management, my advice is always this: don’t pay so much attention to what they say, but rather &lt;em&gt;watch what they do&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t read the slogans on the intranet pages – pay attention and &lt;em&gt;watch what behaviors your company actually rewards&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they’re valuing the sorts of things on Murcko’s list, that’s good news. But if they’re not, they may be rewarding some less worthwhile behaviors, like delivering on deadline even if it means delivering crap, whacking people on the head for coming up with inconvenient data or ideas, advancing projects based more on who proposed them than intrinsic merit, etc. There’s a whole Devil’s Dictionary/Screwtape Letters list of things that good medicinal chemists and scientists &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; do, and you need to be alert to their presence, too.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively reviewed the evolution of segmentectomy for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and the feasibility of multi- and single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Of 348 patients undergoing surgery for TB, the medical records of 121 patients undergoing segmentectomy between January 1996 and November 2015 were reviewed. Clinical information and computed tomography (CT) image characteristics were investigated and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighteen patients underwent direct or intended thoracotomy. Sixty-four underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy (VATS), including 53 multi-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (MITS), and 11 single-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (SITS). Thirty-nine were converted to thoracotomy. The intended thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) and hospital stay (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) than the VATS group although the VATS group had higher grade of cavity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007). The intended thoracotomy group did not differ from converted thoracotomy in operative time, blood loss, or hospital stay, and the grade of pleural thickening was higher in the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). The converted thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss, hospital stay, and complication rate than the MITS group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009, respectively). The MITS group had lower pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, cavity, and tuberculoma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.017, respectively). The SITS group had lower grading in pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, and aspergilloma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, 0.010, and 0.031, respectively). Four patients in the intended thoracotomy group and seven in the converted thoracotomy group had complications compared with three patients in the MITS and two in the SITS group. Risk factors of conversion were pleural thickening and peribronchial lymph node calcification.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Although segmentectomy is technically challenging in patients with pulmonary TB, it could be safely performed using MITS or SITS and should be attempted in selected patients. Its efficacy for medical treatment failure needs investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b7d:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526418000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yau-Lin Tseng, Chao-Chun Chang, Ying-Yuan Chen, Yi-Sheng Liu, Lili Cheng, Jia-Ming Chang, Ming-Ho Wu, Yi-Ting Yen&lt;/p&gt;

The widespread use of social media has created a valuable but underused source of data for the environmental sciences. We demonstrate the potential for images posted to the website Twitter to capture variability in vegetation phenology across United States National Parks. We process a subset of images posted to Twitter within eight U.S. National Parks, with the aim of understanding the amount of green vegetation in each image. Analysis of the relative greenness of the images show statistically significant seasonal cycles across most National Parks at the 95% confidence level, consistent with springtime green-up and fall senescence. Additionally, these social media-derived greenness indices correlate with monthly mean satellite NDVI (r = 0.62), reinforcing the potential value these data could provide in constraining models and observing regions with limited high quality scientific monitoring.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ec:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525986000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sam J.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to obtain population norms and to assess test-retest reliability of EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF for the Indonesian population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A representative sample of 1056 people aged 17–75 years was recruited from the Indonesian general population. We used a multistage stratified quota sampling method with respect to residence, gender, age, education level, religion and ethnicity. Respondents completed EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF with help from an interviewer. Norms data for both instruments were reported. For the test-retest evaluations, a sub-sample of 206 respondents completed both instruments twice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The total sample and test-retest sub-sample were representative of the Indonesian general population. The EQ-5D-5L shows almost perfect agreement between the two tests (Gwet’s AC: 0.85–0.99 and percentage agreement: 90–99%) regarding the five dimensions. However, the agreement of EQ-VAS and index scores can be considered as poor (ICC: 0.45 and 0.37 respectively). For the WHOQOL-BREF, ICCs of the four domains were between 0.70 and 0.79, which indicates moderate to good agreement. For EQ-5D-5L, it was shown that female and older respondents had lower EQ-index scores, whilst rural, younger and higher-educated respondents had higher EQ-VAS scores. For WHOQOL-BREF: male, younger, higher-educated, high-income respondents had the highest scores in most of the domains, overall quality of life, and health satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study provides representative estimates of self-reported health status and quality of life for the general Indonesian population as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF instruments. The descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L and the WHOQOL-BREF have high test-retest reliability while the EQ-VAS and the index score of EQ-5D-5L show poor agreement between the two tests.

Little is known about people’s ability to detect subclinical psychopathy from others’ quotidian social behavior, or about the correlates of variation in this ability. This study sought to address these questions using a thin slice personality judgment paradigm. We presented 108 undergraduate judges (70.4% female) with 1.5 minute video thin slices of zero-acquaintance triadic conversations among other undergraduates (targets: n = 105, 57.1% female). Judges completed self-report measures of general trust, caution, and empathy. Target individuals had completed the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy (LSRP) scale. Judges viewed the videos in one of three conditions: complete audio, silent, or audio from which semantic content had been removed using low-pass filtering. Using a novel other-rating version of the LSRP, judges’ ratings of targets’ primary psychopathy levels were significantly positively associated with targets’ self-reports, but only in the complete audio condition. Judge general trust and target LSRP interacted, such that judges higher in general trust made less accurate judgments with respect to targets higher in primary and total psychopathy. Results are consistent with a scenario in which psychopathic traits are maintained in human populations by negative frequency dependent selection operating through the costs of detecting psychopathy in others.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a189:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525294800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joseph H.

Such antibodies target the HIV-1-envelope (Env) trimer, which is shielded from immune recognition by extraordinary glycosylation and sequence variability. Recognition by broadly neutralizing antibodies thus provides insight into how antibody can bypass these immune-evasion mechanisms. Remarkably, antibodies neutralizing &gt;25% of HIV-1 strains have now been identified that recognize all major exposed surfaces of the prefusion-closed Env trimer. Here we analyzed all 206 broadly neutralizing antibody-HIV-1 Env complexes in the PDB with resolution suitable to define their interaction chemistries. These segregated into 20 antibody classes based on ontogeny and recognition, and into 6 epitope categories (V1V2, glycan-V3, CD4-binding site, silent face center, fusion peptide, and subunit interface) based on recognized Env residues. We measured antibody neutralization on a 208-isolate panel and analyzed features of paratope and B cell ontogeny. The number of protruding loops, CDR H3 length, and level of somatic hypermutation for broadly HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies were significantly higher than for a comparison set of non-HIV-1 antibodies. For epitope, the number of independent sequence segments was higher (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), as well as the glycan component surface area (P = 0.0005). Based on B cell ontogeny, paratope, and breadth, the CD4-binding site antibody IOMA appeared to be a promising candidate for lineage-based vaccine design. In terms of epitope-based vaccine design, antibody VRC34.01 had few epitope segments, low epitope-glycan content, and high epitope-conformational variability, which may explain why VRC34.01-based design is yielding promising vaccine results.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163222f5525:6c9cc6:5785ab88</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525244400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies are desired for their therapeutic potential and as templates for vaccine design.

We analyze the model of social interactions with coevolution of the topology and states of the nodes. This model can be interpreted as a model of language change. We propose different rewiring mechanisms and perform numerical simulations for each. Obtained results are compared with the empirical data gathered from two online databases and anthropological study of Solomon Islands. We study the behavior of the number of languages for different system sizes and we find that only local rewiring, i.e. triadic closure, is capable of reproducing results for the empirical data in a qualitative manner. Furthermore, we cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case. Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d753:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524862800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomasz Raducha, Tomasz Gubiec&lt;/p&gt;

Age is a major risk factor for diseases caused by ischemic hypoxia, such as stroke and coronary artery disease. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are the major cells respond to ischemic hypoxia through angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. However, the effect of aging on EPCs and their responses to hypoxia are not well understood. CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs were isolated from healthy volunteers and aged by replicative senescence, which was to passage cells until their doubling time was twice as long as the original cells. Young and aged CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs were exposed to a hypoxic environment (1% oxygen for 48hrs) and their gene expression profiles were evaluated using gene expression array. Gene array results were confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and BALB/c female athymic nude mice hindlimb ischemia model. We identified 115 differentially expressed genes in young CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs, 54 differentially expressed genes in aged CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs, and 25 common genes between normoxia and hypoxia groups. Among them, the expression of solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 1 (SLC2A1) increased the most by hypoxia in young cells. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated the pathways affected by aging and hypoxia most, including genes “response to oxygen levels” in young EPCs and genes involved “chondroitin sulfate metabolic process” in aged cells. Our study results indicate the key factors that contribute to the effects of aging on response to hypoxia in CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs. With the potential applications of EPCs in cardiovascular and other diseases, our study also provides insight on the impact of ex vivo expansion might have on EPCs.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e50:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525122000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tzu-Wei Wu, Chun-Chieh Liu, Chung-Lieh Hung, Chih-Hsien Yen, Yih-Jer Wu, Li-Yu Wang, Hung-I Yeh&lt;/p&gt;

By means of such process, which occurs at a microscopic scale, worn out bone is replaced by new, fully functional one. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously and independently throughout the body, so the whole skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years. Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types; some are specialized in destroying old bone, whereas others produce new bone to replace the former. The whole process is tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced exactly balances that of old one removed and bone microscopic structure is maintained. To date, many regulatory molecules involved in bone remodeling have been identified, but the precise mechanism of BMU operation remains to be fully elucidated. Given the complexity of the signaling pathways already known, the question arises of ascertaining whether such complexity is an inherent requirement of the process, or a consequence of operational redundancy. In this work we propose a minimal model of BMU function which involves a small number of signals and accounts for fully functional BMU operation. Our main assumptions are i) at any given time, any cell within a BMU can select only one among a reduced choice of decisions: divide, die, migrate or differentiate, ii) such decision is irreversibly determined by depletion of an appropriate internal inhibitor and iii) the dynamics of any such inhibitor is coupled to that of a few external mediators. It is shown that efficient BMU operation then unfolds as an emergent property, which results from individual decisions taken by cells in the BMU unit in the absence of any external planning.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1634a035710:134134b:93d646dc</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525935600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Human skeleton undergoes constant remodeling during the whole life.

There is a severe lack of aphasia screening tools for bedside use in Chinese. A number of aphasia assessment tools have recently been developed abroad, but some of these scales were not suitable for patients with acute stroke. The Language Screening Test (which includes two parallel versions [a/b]) in French has been proven to be an effective and time-saving aphasia screening scale for early-stage stroke patients. Therefore, we worked out a Chinese version of the LAST taking into consideration Chinese language and culture. Two preliminary parallel versions (a/b) were tested on 154 patients with stroke at acute phase and 107 patients with stroke at non-acute phase, with the Western Aphasia Battery serving as a gold standard. The equivalence between the two parallel versions and the reliability/validity of each version were assessed. The median time to complete one preliminary Chinese version (each had some item redundancy) was 98 seconds. Two final parallel versions were established after adjustment/elimination of the redundant items and were found to be equivalent (intra-class correlation coefficient: 0.991). Internal consistency is(Cronbach α for each version [a/b] was 0.956 and 0.965, respectively) good. Internal validity was fine: (a) no floor or ceiling effect/item redundancy; (b) construct validity revealed a 1-dimension structure, just like the French version. The higher educated subjects scored higher than their lower educated counterparts (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;). The external validity: at the optimum cut-off point where the score of version a/b &amp;lt;14 in higher educated group(&amp;lt;13 in lower): the specificity of each version was 0.878/0.902(1/1 in lower) and sensitivity was 0.972/0.944(0.944/0.944 in lower). Inter-rater equivalence (intra-class correlation coefficient) was 1. The Chinese version of the Language Screening Test was proved to be an efficient and time-saving bedside aphasia screening tool for stroke patients at acute phase and can be used by an average medical physician.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1632c3c60b0:1621674:3dd877af</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525467600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hongyan Yang, Shenghua Tian, Constance Flamand-Roze, Ling Gao, Wei Zhang, Yan Li, Jiajia Wang, Zhou Sun, Ying Su, Libin Zhao, Zhihou Liang&lt;/p&gt;

This paper is concerned with the potential multistability of protein concentrations in the cell. That is, situations where one, or a family of, proteins may sit at one of two or more different steady state concentrations in otherwise identical cells, and in spite of them being in the same environment. For models of multisite protein phosphorylation for example, in the presence of excess substrate, it has been shown that the achievable number of stable steady states can increase linearly with the number of phosphosites available. In this paper, we analyse the consequences of adding enzyme docking to these and similar models, with the resultant sequestration of phosphatase and kinase by the fully unphosphorylated and by the fully phosphorylated substrates respectively. In the large molecule numbers limit, where deterministic analysis is applicable, we prove that there are always values for these rates of sequestration which, when exceeded, limit the extent of multistability. For the models considered here, these numbers are much smaller than the affinity of the enzymes to the substrate when it is in a modifiable state. As substrate enzyme-sequestration is increased, we further prove that the number of steady states will inevitably be reduced to one. For smaller molecule numbers a stochastic analysis is more appropriate, where multistability in the large molecule numbers limit can manifest itself as multimodality of the probability distribution; the system spending periods of time in the vicinity of one mode before jumping to another. Here, we find that substrate enzyme sequestration can induce bimodality even in systems where only a single steady state can exist at large numbers. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a weakly chained diagonally dominant M-matrix formulation of the Chemical Master Equation, allowing greater insights in the way particular mechanisms, like enzyme sequestration, can shape probability distributions and therefore exhibit different behaviour across different regimes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2a3YD9EnPsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1636f49ddb2:4e2d25:abeb7260</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526590800000</published><recrawled>1526589728774</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Petrides, Glenn Vinnicombe&lt;/p&gt;

These studies validate BPL as a potential drug target that could serve as an alternate frontline target in the development of new drugs against &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/438/eaal1803.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>befc74a3</fingerprint><title>[Research Articles] Targeting protein biotinylation enhances tuberculosis chemotherapy</title><crawled>1524679859179</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Tiwari, D., Park, S.

LncRNAs are regulatory noncoding RNAs that play crucial roles in many biological processes. The dysregulation of lncRNA is thought to be involved in many complex diseases; lncRNAs are often the targets of miRNAs in the indirect regulation of gene expression. Numerous studies have indicated that miRNA-lncRNA interactions are closely related to the occurrence and development of cancers. Thus, it is important to develop an effective method for the identification of cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA interactions. In this study, we compiled 155653 experimentally validated and predicted miRNA-lncRNA associations, which we defined as basic interactions. We next constructed an individual-specific miRNA-lncRNA network (ISMLN) for each cancer sample and a basic miRNA-lncRNA network (BMLN) for each type of cancer by examining the expression profiles of miRNAs and lncRNAs in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. We then selected potential miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers based on the BLMN. Using this method, we identified cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers and modules specific to a certain cancer. This method of profiling will contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of cancers at the level of gene regulatory networks.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a67:11c251fd</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525208400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guangle Zhang, Cong Pian, Zhi Chen, Jin Zhang, Mingmin Xu, Liangyun Zhang, Yuanyuan Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Epiretinal traction is not responsible only for epiretinal but also intraretinal changes. This study aims to describe structural and vascular intraretinal changes after macular peeling in idiopathic (iERM) vs diabetic ERM (dERM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective interventional study on forty-two eyes, 23 with iERMs and 19 with dERMs, undergoing ERM-ILM peeling. We performed SD-OCT preoperatively, 1 and 6 months postoperatively to assess central macular thickness (CMT), intraretinal cysts (IC) and/or continuous ectopic inner foveal layers (CEIFL), superficial and deep capillary free zone (CFZ) area on OCT-A. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as a Müller cells marker, was detected immunohistochemically on ILM specimens, to assess Müller cells iatrogenic damage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The CEIFLs were significantly more common in iERMs (12 (52.2%) in iERMs vs 2 (10.5%) in dERMs, p = 0.004), whereas ICs in dERMs (6 (26.1%) in iERMs vs 17 (89.5%) in dERMs, p&amp;lt;0.001). Median preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/50 [20/40-20/66] and 20/33 [20/25-20/40] in iERMs and 20/100 [20/66-20/200] and 20/50 [20/50-20/66] in dERMs, respectively. Median preoperative and postoperative CMT was 423 [370–488] and 364 [329–382] μm in iERM group and 465 [447–503] and 378 [359–433] μm in dERM group, respectively. The BCVA improvement and reduction of CMT thickness were significant in both groups (p&amp;lt;0.001). The presence of CEIFL was associated with lower BCVA in iERMs. Deep CFZ network significantly increased only in dERMs, passing from 0.34 [0.29–0.42] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; preoperatively to 0.56 [0.46–0.6] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 6-month follow-up (p&amp;lt;0.001). The GFAP expression was significantly higher in dERMs (p = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The intraretinal changes are different in iERMs and dERMs, as increased expression of CEIFLs in iERMs vs ICs in dERMs. The CEIFLs are associated with worse anatomical and functional outcomes in iERMs, whereas GFAP espression in peeled ILMs is higher in dERMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475067:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525813200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mario R.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Different phenotypes of wheezing have been described to date but not in early life. We aim to describe wheezing phenotypes between the ages of two months and one year, and assess risk factors associated with these wheezing phenotypes in a large birth cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 18,041 infants from the ELFE (French Longitudinal Study of Children) birth cohort. Parents reported wheezing and respiratory symptoms at two and 12 months, and answered a complete questionnaire (exposure during pregnancy, parental allergy).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Children with no symptoms (controls) accounted for 77.2%, 2.1% had had wheezing at two months but no wheezing at one year (intermittent), 2.4% had persistent wheezing, while 18.3% had incident wheezing at one year. Comparing persistent wheezing to controls showed that having one sibling (ORa = 2.19) or 2 siblings (ORa = 2.23) compared to none, nocturnal cough (OR = 5.2), respiratory distress (OR = 4.1) and excess bronchial secretions (OR = 3.47) at two months, reflux in the child at 2 months (OR = 1.55), maternal history of asthma (OR = 1.46) and maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.57) were significantly associated with persistent wheezing. These same factors, along with cutaneous rash in the child at 2 months (OR = 1.13) and paternal history of asthma (OR = 1.32) were significantly associated with increased odds of incident wheezing. Having one sibling (ORa = 1.9) compared to none, nocturnal cough at 2 months (OR = 1.76) and excess bronchial secretions at 2 months (OR = 1.65) were significantly associated with persistent compared to intermittent wheezing.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Respiratory symptoms (cough, respiratory distress, and excessive bronchial secretion) were significantly associated with a high risk of persistent wheezing at one year.

Prepartum supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) may influence lipolysis and hyperketonemia in dairy cows. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of prepartum CLA supplementation on lactation performance and serum fatty acids (FA) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in early lactation dairy cows, and secondarily on reproductive performance. Multiparous cows were enrolled in the study at 18 days prior to expected calving date, and randomly assigned 100 g/day of Lutrell Pure (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; 75% FA), providing 10 g/day of each CLA isomer (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-10 &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-12 and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-9 &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-11 CLA) or equivalent amount of rumen inert fatty acids as control (78 g/day of Energy Booster 100; Milk Specialties Global, Eden Prairie, MN). Treatments were top dressed daily to individual cows from enrollment to calving and all cows were offered the same ration. Blood samples were collected on the first day of supplementation, 10 days prepartum, and 1, 7, 14, and 30 days postpartum. Hyperketonemia was defined as serum BHB ≥ 1.2 mM. Milk yield was recorded daily until 60 days postpartum and averaged weekly. Milk samples were obtained weekly for component analysis. Prepartum CLA supplementation tended to increase serum concentration of cis-9, trans-11 CLA and increased trans-10, cis-12 CLA prepartum. Cows supplemented with CLA had increased milk protein yield and tended to have increased milk fat yield and milk yield, which together resulted in greater energy content of milk. Cows supplemented with CLA had lower serum FA on day 1 and 7 postpartum and overall lower serum BHB postpartum, which resulted in decreased prevalence of hyperketonemia on day 14 postpartum. There were no differences in body condition score change, other health disorders, or reproductive outcomes by treatment. Together, these findings indicate that prepartum CLA supplementation may be a plausible strategy to positively influence postpartum performance.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85441:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526590800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael Caputo Oliveira, Ryan S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Almost all medical journals now require authors to publicly disclose conflicts of interests (COI). The same standard and scrutiny is rarely employed for the editors of the journals although COI may affect editorial decisions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective observational study to determine the prevalence and magnitude of financial relationships among editors of 60 influential US medical journals (10 each for internal medicine and five subspecialties: cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, dermatology and allergy &amp;amp; immunology). Open Payments database was reviewed to determine the percentage of physician editors receiving payments and the nature and amount of these payments.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;703 unique physician editors were included in our analysis. 320/703 (46%) received 8659 general payments totaling $8,120,562. The median number of payments per editor was 9 (IQR 3–26) and the median amount per payment was $91 (IQR $21–441). The median total payment received by each editor in one year was $4,364 (IQR $319–23,143). 152 (48%) editors received payments more than $5,000 in a year, a threshold considered significant by the National Institutes of Health.

Background &lt;p&gt;Almost all medical journals now require authors to publicly disclose conflicts of interests (COI). The same standard and scrutiny is rarely employed for the editors of the journals although COI may affect editorial decisions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective observational study to determine the prevalence and magnitude of financial relationships among editors of 60 influential US medical journals (10 each for internal medicine and five subspecialties: cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, dermatology and allergy &amp;amp; immunology). Open Payments database was reviewed to determine the percentage of physician editors receiving payments and the nature and amount of these payments.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;703 unique physician editors were included in our analysis. 320/703 (46%) received 8659 general payments totaling $8,120,562. The median number of payments per editor was 9 (IQR 3–26) and the median amount per payment was $91 (IQR $21–441). The median total payment received by each editor in one year was $4,364 (IQR $319–23,143). 152 (48%) editors received payments more than $5,000 in a year, a threshold considered significant by the National Institutes of Health. COI policies for editors were available for 34/60 (57%) journals but only 7/34 (21%) publicly reported the disclosures and only 2 (3.%) reported the dollar amount received.&lt;/p&gt; Interpretation &lt;p&gt;A significant number of editors of internal medicine and subspecialty medical journals have financial COI and very few are publicly disclosed. Specialty journal editors have more COI compared to general medicine journal editors. Current policies for disclosing COI for editors are inconsistent and do not comply with the recommended standards.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197141</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>c119da2c</fingerprint><title>Conflicts of interest of editors of medical journals</title><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Waqas Haque</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197141</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197141</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197141</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16339790828:2611d9c:3dd877af</id><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525325536000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/17&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>e1b88d9a</fingerprint><title>Effects of surface motion and electron-hole pair excitations in CO2 dissociation and scattering on Ni(100)</title><crawled>1525677623336</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Xuan Luo</name></author><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025029?af=R</link><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025029?af=R</originId><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025029?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: &lt;i&gt;mi&lt;/i&gt;R-3140 suppresses tumor cell growth by targeting &lt;i&gt;BRD4&lt;/i&gt;

The P8 stem-loop region of the &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L intron, which is known to be hypervariable in size with multiple repeat motifs and created difficulties in alignment, is always excluded in phylogenetic as well as barcode analyses. This region was investigated for species discrimination in 98 taxa of orchids belonging to the tribe Vandeae using in silico mapping of restriction site polymorphism. The length of the P8 regions varied from 200 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Aerides rosea&lt;/i&gt; to 669 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Dendrophylax sallei&lt;/i&gt;. Forty two taxa had unique lengths, while as many as eight shared a common length of 521 nucleotides. Of the 35 restriction endonucleases producing digestions in the P8 regions, three, viz., &lt;i&gt;Ags&lt;/i&gt;I, &lt;i&gt;Apo&lt;/i&gt;I and &lt;i&gt;Tsp&lt;/i&gt;DTI turned out to have recognition sites across all the 98 taxa being studied. When their restriction data were combined, 92 taxa could be discriminated leaving three taxon pairs.

To address this limitation we use viral infection, specifically HIV-1 and HCV, as a paradigm to model control of an infected cell. Using a large human signalling network comprised of over 6000 human proteins and more than 34000 directed interactions, we compared two dynamic states: normal/uninfected and infected. Our network controllability analysis demonstrates how a virus efficiently brings the dynamic host system into its control by mostly targeting existing critical control nodes, requiring fewer nodes than in the uninfected network. The driver nodes used by the virus are distributed throughout the pathways in specific locations enabling effective control of the cell via the high control centrality of the viral and targeted host nodes. Furthermore, this viral infection of the human system permits discrimination between available network-control models, and demonstrates the minimum-dominating set (MDS) method better accounts for how biological information and signals are transferred than the maximum matching (MM) method as it identified most of the HIV-1 proteins as critical driver nodes and goes beyond identifying receptors as the only critical driver nodes. This is because MDS, unlike MM, accounts for the inherent non-linearity of signalling pathways. Our results demonstrate control-theory gives a more complete and dynamic understanding of the viral hijack mechanism when compared with previous analyses limited to static single-state networks.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16322507d6a:69c65d:3dd877af</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525244400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>In recent years control theory has been applied to biological systems with the aim of identifying the minimum set of molecular interactions that can drive the network to a required state.

Our results provide mechanistic insight into immune modulation by DMF and represent a proof of concept that aerobic glycolysis is a therapeutic target in autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/449.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>151</engagement><fingerprint>1112b948</fingerprint><keywords><item>Immunology, Medicine, Diseases</item></keywords><crawled>1524766155374</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Dimethyl fumarate targets GAPDH and aerobic glycolysis to modulate immunity</title><author><name>Kornberg, M.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16340d7cea2:14b5655:abeb7260</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525813200000</published><recrawled>1525801327188</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew E.

Motor tics are sudden, repetitive, involuntary movements representing the hallmark behaviors of the neurodevelopmental disease Tourette’s syndrome (TS). The primary cause of TS remains unclear. The initial observation that dopaminergic antagonists alleviate tics led to the development of a dopaminergic theory of TS etiology which is supported by &lt;i&gt;post mortem&lt;/i&gt; and in vivo studies indicating that non-physiological activation of the striatum could generate tics. The striatum controls movement execution through the balanced activity of dopamine receptor D1 and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons of the direct and indirect pathway, respectively. Different neurotransmitters can activate or repress striatal activity and among them, dopamine plays a major role. In this study we introduced a chronic dopaminergic alteration in juvenile rats, in order to modify the delicate balance between direct and indirect pathway. This manipulation was done in the dorsal striatum, that had been associated with tic-like movements generation in animal models. The results were movements resembling tics, which were categorized and scored according to a newly developed rating scale and were reduced by clonidine and riluzole treatment. Finally, &lt;i&gt;post mortem&lt;/i&gt; analyses revealed altered RNA expression of dopaminergic receptors D1 and D2, suggesting an imbalanced dopaminergic regulation of medium spiny neuron activity as being causally related to the observed phenotype.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae77:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524776400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ester Nespoli, Francesca Rizzo, Tobias Boeckers, Ulrike Schulze, Bastian Hengerer&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Cancer and factor V Leiden mutation are both risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Beta cell dysfunction accompanies and drives the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), but there are few clinical biomarkers available to assess islet cell stress in humans. Secretagogin, a protein enriched in pancreatic islets, demonstrates protective effects on beta cell function in animals. However, its potential as a circulating biomarker released from human beta cells and islets has not been studied. In this study primary human islets, beta cells and plasma samples were used to explore secretion and expression of secretagogin in relation to the T2D pathology. Secretagogin was abundantly and specifically expressed and secreted from human islets. Furthermore, T2D patients had an elevated plasma level of secretagogin compared with matched healthy controls, which was confirmed in plasma of diabetic mice transplanted with human islets. Additionally, the plasma secretagogin level of the human cohort had an inverse correlation to clinical assessments of beta cell function. To explore the mechanism of secretagogin release &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, human beta cells (EndoC-βH1) were exposed to elevated glucose or cellular stress-inducing agents. Secretagogin was not released in parallel with glucose stimulated insulin release, but was markedly elevated in response to endoplasmic reticulum stressors and cytokines. These findings indicate that secretagogin is a potential novel biomarker, reflecting stress and islet cell dysfunction in T2D patients.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d754:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524862800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sara F.

A high-throughput plant phenotyping system automatically observes and grows many plant samples. Many plant sample images are acquired by the system to determine the characteristics of the plants (populations). Stable image acquisition and processing is very important to accurately determine the characteristics. However, hardware for acquiring plant images rapidly and stably, while minimizing plant stress, is lacking. Moreover, most software cannot adequately handle large-scale plant imaging. To address these problems, we developed a new, automated, high-throughput plant phenotyping system using simple and robust hardware, and an automated plant-imaging-analysis pipeline consisting of machine-learning-based plant segmentation. Our hardware acquires images reliably and quickly and minimizes plant stress. Furthermore, the images are processed automatically. In particular, large-scale plant-image datasets can be segmented precisely using a classifier developed using a superpixel-based machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest), and variations in plant parameters (such as area) over time can be assessed using the segmented images. We performed comparative evaluations to identify an appropriate learning algorithm for our proposed system, and tested three robust learning algorithms. We developed not only an automatic analysis pipeline but also a convenient means of plant-growth analysis that provides a learning data interface and visualization of plant growth trends. Thus, our system allows end-users such as plant biologists to analyze plant growth via large-scale plant image data easily.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d755:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524862800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Unseok Lee, Sungyul Chang, Gian Anantrio Putra, Hyoungseok Kim, Dong Hwan Kim&lt;/p&gt;

This work presents an alternative device for cancer screening in liquid biopsies. It combines a biomimetic film (i) with electrochemical detection (ii). The biomimetic film (i) was obtained by electro-polymerizing amine-substituted benzene rings around a CA 15–3 target. This protein target was previously adsorbed on a gold (Au) support and incubated in charged monomers (4-Styrenesulfonate sodium and 3-Hydroxytyraminium chloride). The protein was further eliminated by enzymatic activity, leaving behind vacant sites for subsequent rebinding. Electrochemical detection (ii) was achieved on an Au working electrode, designed on commercial screen-printed electrodes. Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and ellipsometric readings were used to follow the chemical modification of the Au surface. The ability of the material to rebind CA15-3 was monitored by electrochemical techniques. The device displayed linear responses to CA15-3 ranging from 0.25 to 10.00 U/mL, with detection limits of 0.05 U/mL. Accurate results were obtained by applying the sensor to the analysis of CA15-3 in PBS buffer and in serum samples. This biosensing device displayed successful features for the detection of CA 15–3 and constitutes a promising tool for breast cancer screening procedures in point-of-care applications. Moreover, its scale-up seems feasible as it contains a plastic antibody assembled &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;, in less than 1 minute, and the analysis of serum takes less than 30 minutes.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a64:11c251fd</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525208400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rui S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obstetric complications and maternal deaths can be prevented through safe delivery process. Facility based delivery significantly reduces maternal mortality by increasing women’s access to skilled personnel attendance. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, most deliveries take place without skilled attendants and outside health facilities. Utilization of facility-based delivery is affected by socio-cultural norms and several other factors including cost, long distance, accessibility and availability of quality services. This study examined country-level variations of the self-reported causes of not choosing to deliver at a health facility.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional data on 37,086 community dwelling women aged between 15–49 years were collected from DHS surveys in Ethiopia (n = 13,053) and Nigeria (n = 24,033). Outcome variables were the self-reported causes of not delivering at health facilities which were regressed against selected sociodemographic and community level determinants. In total eight items complaints were identified for non-use of facility delivery: 1) Cost too much 2) Facility not open, 3) Too far/no transport, 4) don’t trust facility/poor service, 5) No female provider, 6) Husband/family didn’t allow, 7) Not necessary, 8) Not customary. Multivariable regression methods were used for measuring the associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In both countries a large proportion of the women mentioned facility delivery as not necessary, 54.9% (52.3–57.9) in Nigeria and 45.4% (42.0–47.5) in Ethiopia. Significant urban-rural variations were observed in the prevalence of the self-reported causes of non-utilisation. Women in the rural areas are more likely to report delivering at health facility as not customary/not necessary and healthy facility too far/no transport. However, urban women were more likely to complain that husband/family did not allow and that the costs were too high.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Women in the rural were more likely to regard facility delivery as unnecessary and complain about transportation and financial difficulties. In order to achieving the maternal mortality related targets, addressing regional disparities in accessing maternal healthcare services should be regarded as a priority of health promotion programs in Nigeria and Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3aec:5785ab88</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525381200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sanni Yaya, Ghose Bishwajit, Olalekan A.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of exercise training with modest or greater weight loss (≥3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) on insulin sensitivity, lipoprotein concentrations, and lipoprotein particle size in overweight and obese participants.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Adults (N = 163, body mass index: 25–37 [kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]) participated in 8 months of exercise training. Insulin sensitivity, lipid concentrations, lipid particle size and other cardiometabolic variables were measured at baseline and follow-up. Participants were categorized by whether they achieved at least modest weight loss (≥ 3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) following the intervention.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A greater improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in adults performing exercise training with at least modest weight loss (2.2 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 1.5 to 2.8) compared to those who did not (0.8 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 0.5 to 1.2). Similar results were observed for acute insulin response, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol concentration, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size (p&amp;lt;0.05), when all exercise groups were combined. No significant results across weight loss categories were observed for LDL, HDL, glucose, or insulin levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The present study suggests that aerobic exercise combined with at least modest weight loss leads to greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, triglycerides as well as other non-traditional lipid risk factors (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL/LDL particle size). Clinicians should advocate patients who are overweight/obese to exercise and obtain modest weight loss for improved cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7218:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526677200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Damon L.

Clinicians should advocate patients who are overweight/obese to exercise and obtain modest weight loss for improved cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196637</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>a4ae04b1</fingerprint><title>Effects of aerobic training with and without weight loss on insulin sensitivity and lipids</title><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Damon L.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH. Consistently funded interventions included testing, partner services and linkage to care and interventions for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal allocation shifted when there were differences in transmission category proportions and progress along the HIV care continuum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The robustness of the results suggests that most health departments can use these analyses to guide the investment of CDC HIV prevention funds into strategies to prevent the most new cases of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b8:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526504400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emine Yaylali, Paul G.

and Cs, from 0 K to 200 K. To determine the relative stability of different isomers of each M+(H2O)n cluster as a function of temperature, replica exchange simulations are
carried out at both classical and quantum levels with the recently developed many-body
MB-nrg potential energy functions, which have been shown to exhibit chemical accuracy. Anharmonic vibrational spectra are then calculated within the local monomer
approximation and found to be in agreement with the available experimental data,
providing further support for the accuracy of the MB-nrg potential energy functions.
The present analysis indicates that nuclear quantum effects become increasingly im-
portant for larger M+(H2O)n clusters containing the heavier alkali metal ions, which
is explained in terms of competing ion-water and water-water interactions along with
the interplay between energetic and entropic effects. Directly connecting experimental
measurements with molecular properties calculated at the quantum mechanical level,
this study represents a further step toward the development of a consistent picture of
ion hydration from the gas to the condensed phase.</description><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>A quantitative characterization of the molecular mechanisms that regulate ion solvation is key to the microscopic understanding of fundamental processes taking place in

The evaluation of protected area networks on their capacity to preserve species distributions is a key topic in conservation biology. There are different types of protected areas, with National Parks those with highest level of protection. National Parks can be declared attending to many ecological features that include the presence of certain animal species. Here, we selected 37 vertebrate species that were highlighted as having relevant natural value for at least one of the 10 National Parks of mainland Spain. We modelled species distributions with the favourability function, and applied the Insecurity Index to detect the degree of protection of favourable areas for each species. Two metrics of Insecurity Index were defined for each species: the Insecurity Index in each of the cells, and the Overall Insecurity Index of a species. The former allows the identification of insecure areas for each species that can be used to establish spatial conservation priorities. The latter gives a value of Insecurity for each species, which we used to calculate the Representativeness of favourable areas for the species in the network. As expected, due to the limited extension of the National Park network, all species have high values of Insecurity; i.e., just a narrow proportion of their favourable areas are covered by a National Park. However, the majority of species favourable areas are well represented in the network, i.e., the percentage of favourable areas covered by the National Park network is higher than the percentage of mainland Spain covered by the network (result also supported by a randomization approach). Even if a reserve network only covers a low percentage of a country, the Overall Insecurity Index allows an objective assessment of its capacity to represent species. Beyond the results presented here, the Insecurity Index has the potential to be extrapolated to other areas and to cover a wide range of species.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122b:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526936400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alba Estrada, Raimundo Real&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;For behaviour-change interventions to be successful they must be acceptable to users and overcome barriers to behaviour change. The Person-Based Approach can help to optimise interventions to maximise acceptability and engagement. This article presents a novel, efficient and systematic method that can be used as part of the Person-Based Approach to rapidly analyse data from development studies to inform intervention modifications. We describe how we used this approach to optimise a digital intervention for patients with hypertension (HOME BP), which aims to implement medication and lifestyle changes to optimise blood pressure control.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In study 1, hypertensive patients (N = 12) each participated in three think-aloud interviews, providing feedback on a prototype of HOME BP. In study 2 patients (N = 11) used HOME BP for three weeks and were then interviewed about their experiences. Studies 1 and 2 were used to identify detailed changes to the intervention content and potential barriers to engagement with HOME BP. In study 3 (N = 7) we interviewed hypertensive patients who were not interested in using an intervention like HOME BP to identify potential barriers to uptake, which informed modifications to our recruitment materials. Analysis in all three studies involved detailed tabulation of patient data and comparison to our modification criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Studies 1 and 2 indicated that the HOME BP procedures were generally viewed as acceptable and feasible, but also highlighted concerns about monitoring blood pressure correctly at home and making medication changes remotely. Patients in study 3 had additional concerns about the safety and security of the intervention. Modifications improved the acceptability of the intervention and recruitment materials.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This paper provides a detailed illustration of how to use the Person-Based Approach to refine a digital intervention for hypertension. The novel, efficient approach to analysis and criteria for deciding when to implement intervention modifications described here may be useful to others developing interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3ae7:5785ab88</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525381200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine Bradbury, Katherine Morton, Rebecca Band, Anne van Woezik, Rebecca Grist, Richard J.

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, can elude hosts’ innate and adaptive immunity as part of the course of infection. The ability of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; to invade or be internalized by host cells in vitro has been proposed as a mechanism for the pathogen to evade immune responses or antimicrobials. We have previously shown that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; can be internalized by human neuroglial cells. In this study we demonstrate that these cells take up &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; via coiling phagocytosis mediated by the formin, Daam1, a process similarly described for human macrophages. Following coincubation with glial cells, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was enwrapped by Daam1-enriched coiling pseudopods. Coiling of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was significantly reduced when neuroglial cells were pretreated with anti-Daam1 antibody indicating the requirement for Daam1 for borrelial phagocytosis. Confocal microscopy showed Daam1 colocalizing to the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface suggesting interaction with borrelial membrane protein(s). Using the yeast 2-hybrid system for identifying protein-protein binding, we found that the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface lipoprotein, BBA66, bound the FH2 subunit domain of Daam1. Recombinant proteins were used to validate binding by ELISA, pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation. Evidence for native Daam1 and BBA66 interaction was suggested by colocalization of the proteins in the course of borrelial capture by the Daam1-enriched pseudopodia. Additionally, we found a striking reduction in coiling for a BBA66-deficient mutant strain compared to BBA66-expressing strains. These results show that coiling phagocytosis is a mechanism for borrelial internalization by neuroglial cells mediated by Daam1.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559164:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525986000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shanna K.

MRL/MpJ mice have abundant ovarian mast cells (MCs) as compared with other strains at postnatal day 0 (P0); however, they sharply decrease after birth. These ovarian MCs, particularly beneath the ovarian surface epithelium (SE), which express mucosal MC (MMC) marker, might participate in early follicular development. This study investigated the changes in spatiotemporal distribution of MCs in the perinatal MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. At P0 to P7, the MCs were densely localized to the ovary, especially their caudomedial region around the ovary-fimbria connection. The neonatal ovarian MCs showed intermediate characteristics of MMC and connective tissue MC (CTMC), and the latter phenotype became evident with aging. However, the expression ratio of the MMC to CTMC marker increased from P0 to P4 in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovary. Similarly, the ratio of MCs facing SE to total MC number increased with aging, although the number of ovarian MCs decreased, indicating the relative increase in MMC phenotypes in the early neonatal ovary. Neither proliferating nor apoptotic MCs were found in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. The parenchymal cells surrounding MCs at ovary-fimbria connection showed similar molecular expression patterns (E-cadherin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Foxl2&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/Gata4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as that of the ovarian surface epithelial cells. At P2, around the ovary-fimbria connection, c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; immature oocytes formed clusters called nests, and some MCs localized adjacent to c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; oocytes within the nests. These results indicated that in postnatal MRL/MpJ mice, ovarian MCs changed their distribution by migrating toward the parenchymal cells composing ovary-fimbria connection, which possessed similar characteristics to the ovarian surface epithelium. Thus, we elucidated the spatiotemporal alterations of the ovarian MCs in MRL/MpJ mice, and suggested their importance during the early follicular development by migrating toward the ovary-fimbria connection. MRL/MpJ mice would be useful to elucidate the relationship between neonatal immunity and reproductive systems.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba8:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524517200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Teppei Nakamura, Masataka Chihara, Osamu Ichii, Saori Otsuka-Kanazawa, Ken-ichi Nagasaki, Yaser Hosny Ali Elewa, Osamu Tatsumi, Yasuhiro Kon&lt;/p&gt;

Sulphonylurea drugs stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells primarily by inhibiting ATP sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channels in the β-cell membrane. The effective sulphonylurea concentration at its site of action is significantly attenuated by binding to serum albumin, which makes it difficult to compare &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. We therefore measured the ability of gliclazide and glibenclamide to inhibit K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of serum albumin. We used this data, together with estimates of free drug concentrations from binding studies, to predict the extent of sulphonylurea inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels at therapeutic concentrations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents from mouse pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes were measured using the patch-clamp technique. Gliclazide and glibenclamide binding to human plasma were determined in spiked plasma samples using an ultrafiltration-mass spectrometry approach. Bovine serum albumin (60g/l) produced a mild, non-significant reduction of gliclazide block of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents in pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration &amp;lt;0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect. In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543a:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526590800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Proks, Holger Kramer, Elizabeth Haythorne, Frances M.

In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>9be6efb0</fingerprint><title>Binding of sulphonylureas to plasma proteins – A K&amp;lt;sub&gt;ATP&amp;lt;/sub&gt; channel perspective</title><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><updated>1526590800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Peter Proks</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>Why is the alligator heart so similar to the hearts of birds and mammals?</description><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1633f21b297:14c0ca:3dd877af</id><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Why is the alligator heart so similar to the hearts of birds and mammals?</content></summary><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36882</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36882</canonicalUrl><engagement>13</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>fbd08b31</fingerprint><keywords><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item><item>Genomics and Evolutionary Biology</item></keywords><crawled>1525772563095</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>The beat goes on</title><author><name>tobias.wang@bios.au.dk (Tobias Wang)</name></author><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36882</link><published>1525737600000</published><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36882</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyo Geun Choi, Woojin Bang, Bumjung Park, Songyong Sim, Kyung Tae, Chang Myeon Song&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of sialolithiasis in nephrolithiasis patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from the national cohort study from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, we selected 24,038 patients with nephrolithiasis. The control group consisted of 96,152 participants without nephrolithiasis who were matched 1:4 by age, sex, income, region of residence, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The incidence of sialolithiasis in the two groups was compared, with a follow-up period of up to 12 years. The crude and adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of nephrolithiasis to sialolithiasis was analyzed with a Cox-proportional hazard regression model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The rates of sialolithiasis in the nephrolithiasis group and the control group were not significantly different (0.08% vs. 0.1%, P = 0.447). The crude and adjusted hazard ratios of nephrolithiasis to sialolithiasis were not statistically significant (crude HR = 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–1.35, P = 0.448; adjusted HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.49–1.33, P = 0.399). Subgroup analyses according to age and sex also failed to reveal statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;There is no evidence of an increased risk of sialolithiasis associated with nephrolithiasis.

Insect growth regulator insecticides mimic the action of hormones on the growth and development of insect pests. However, they can affect the development of non-target arthropods. In the present study, we tested the effects of the growth regulator insecticide fenoxycarb on several endpoints in the freshwater crustacean &lt;i&gt;Gammarus fossarum&lt;/i&gt; (Amphipoda). Females carrying embryos in their open brood pouch were exposed to 50 μg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; fenoxycarb throughout the entire oogenesis (i.e. 21 days). After exposure, newborn individuals from exposed embryos were removed from the maternal open brood pouch for lipidomic analysis, while males were added to assess the reproductive success. After fertilization, the lipid profile, energy reserve content (lipids, proteins and glycogen), and activity of phenoloxidase − an enzyme involved in the immune response − were measured in females. No significant effect of fenoxycarb exposure was observed on the lipid profile of both newborn individuals and females, while reproductive success was severely impaired in exposed females. Particularly, precopulatory behavior was significantly reduced and fertilized eggs were unviable. This study highlighted the deleterious effects of the insect growth regulator fenoxycarb on gammarid reproduction, which could have severe repercussions on population dynamics.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d74a:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524862800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hélène Arambourou, Inmaculada Fuertes, Emmanuelle Vulliet, Gaëlle Daniele, Patrice Noury, Nicolas Delorme, Khedidja Abbaci, Carlos Barata&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between experiences of being bullied at school and psychological distress/work engagement, with six steps.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis was conducted for 3,111 workers. The number of respondents who reported being bullied in elementary or junior high school was 1,318 (42%). We found that the experience of being bullied at school was significantly associated with high psychological distress in adulthood (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .079, p = &amp;lt; .0001); however, the work engagement scores of respondents who were bullied were significantly higher than for people who were not bullied at school (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .068, p = &amp;lt; .0001), after adjusting all covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Being bullied at school was positively associated with both psychological distress and work engagement in a sample of workers. Being bullied at school may be a predisposing factor for psychological distress, as previously reported. The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559154:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525986000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Iwanaga, Kotaro Imamura, Akihito Shimazu, Norito Kawakami&lt;/p&gt;

The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197168</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>48429c9d</fingerprint><title>The impact of being bullied at school on psychological distress and work engagement in a community sample of adult workers in Japan</title><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Mai Iwanaga</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197168</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197168</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197168</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shugang Luo, Yuexia Sun, Jing Hou, Xiangrui Kong, Pan Wang, Qingnan Zhang, Jan Sundell&lt;/p&gt;
This study aims to find out the relationship between pet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children aged 0–8 years old in Tianjin, China. Parental or guardians reports of 7360 children were analyzed. 1490 (21.6%) families kept pets at the time of the survey (current), among them 4.0% cats, and 14.7% dogs. For the first year of life of children (early), 1196 (18.4%) families kept pets, and among them 3.2% cats, and 13.7% dogs. Exposure to a pet in early childhood significantly increased the risk of current wheeze, current dry cough, and diagnosed rhinitis. 17.9% of parents reported an avoidance behavior, i.e., had removed or refrained a pet due to asthma or allergy in the family. After adjustment for avoidance behavior, the negative effect of pet keeping on children’s health became even more obvious, with e.g. an AOR of 3.37 (1.58–7.19) for diagnosed asthma, 3.60 (2.07–6.27) for diagnosed rhinitis, 1.92 (1.31–2.81) for diagnosed eczema. A dose-response relationship between pet keeping at current and current wheeze, current eczema and diagnosed eczema was found. In conclusion, pet exposure in early life of children in Tianjin is a risk factor for asthma and allergies among children aged 0–8 years old.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7af:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526504400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shugang Luo, Yuexia Sun, Jing Hou, Xiangrui Kong, Pan Wang, Qingnan Zhang, Jan Sundell&lt;/p&gt;

Systematics is considered important for effective toothbrushing. A theoretical concept of systematics in toothbrushing and a validated index to quantify it using observational data is suggested. The index consists of three components: completeness (all areas of the dentition reached), isochronicity (all areas brushed equally long) and consistency (avoiding frequent alternations between areas). Toothbrushing should take a sufficient length of time; therefore, this parameter is part of the index value calculation. Quantitative data from video observations were used including the number of changes between areas, number of areas reached, absolute brushing time and brushing time per area. These data were fed into two algorithms that converted the behaviour into two index values (each with values between 0 and 1) and were summed as the Toothbrushing Systematics Index (TSI) value; 0 indicates completely unsystematic and 2 indicates perfectly systematic brushing. The index was developed using theoretical data. The data matrices revealed the highest values when all areas are reached and brushed equally long. Few changes occurred between the areas when the brushing duration was ≥90 s; the lowest values occurred under opposite conditions. Clinical applicability was tested with data from re-analysed videos from an earlier intervention study aiming to establish a pre-defined toothbrushing sequence. Subjects who fully adopted this sequence had a baseline TSI of 1.30±0.26, which increased to 1.74±0.09 after the intervention (p≤0.001). When the participants who only partially adopted the sequence were included, the respective values were 1.25±0.27 and 1.69±0.14 (p≤0.001). The suggested new TS-index can cover a variety of clinically meaningful variations of systematic brushing, validly quantifies the changes in toothbrushing systematics and has discriminative power.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4b:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525122000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nadine Schlueter, Katrin Winterfeld, Vicenç Quera, Tobias Winterfeld, Carolina Ganss&lt;/p&gt;

For the last 100 years, it has been uncontroversial to state that the plant germline is set aside late in development, but there is surprisingly little evidence to support this view. In contrast, much evolutionary theory and several recent empirical studies seem to suggest the opposite—that the germlines of some and perhaps most plants may be set aside early in development. But is this really the case? How much does it matter? How can we reconcile the new evidence with existing knowledge of plant development? And is there a way to reliably establish the timing of germline segregation in both model and nonmodel plants? Answering these questions is vital to understanding one of the most fundamental aspects of plant development and evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0LiCyHbkEf4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1636a1fc414:493cd6:abeb7260</id><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526504400000</published><recrawled>1526494327964</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Lanfear&lt;/p&gt;

Mesothelin is a cell surface protein that is overexpressed in numerous cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, liver, and pancreatic tumors. Aberrant expression of mesothelin has been shown to promote tumor progression and metastasis through interaction with established tumor biomarker CA125. Therefore, molecules that specifically bind to mesothelin have potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, no mesothelin-targeting molecules are currently approved for routine clinical use. While antibodies that target mesothelin are in development, some clinical applications may require a targeting molecule with an alternative protein fold. For example, non-antibody proteins are more suitable for molecular imaging and may facilitate diverse chemical conjugation strategies to create drug delivery complexes. In this work, we engineered variants of the fibronectin type III domain (Fn3) non-antibody protein scaffold to bind to mesothelin with high affinity, using directed evolution and yeast surface display. Lead engineered Fn3 variants were solubly produced and purified from bacterial culture at high yield. Upon specific binding to mesothelin on human cancer cell lines, the engineered Fn3 proteins internalized and co-localized to early endosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-antibody proteins engineered to bind mesothelin. The results validate that non-antibody proteins can be engineered to bind to tumor biomarker mesothelin, and encourage the continued development of engineered variants for applications such as targeted diagnostics and therapeutics.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475064:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525813200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Allison R.

Kay, Pramodh Vallurupalli&lt;/p&gt;
Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding.

Kay, Pramodh Vallurupalli&lt;/p&gt;
Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; dominant pathway for ligand binding.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v22HP1dNVjw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>43541b1d</fingerprint><author><name>Jagannath Mondal</name></author><crawled>1526665788268</crawled><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Atomic resolution mechanism of ligand binding to a solvent inaccessible cavity in T4 lysozyme</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</originId><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/v22HP1dNVjw/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24853-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24853-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/7A__SGOLens&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1636d2f50ed:47c65fa:93d646dc</id><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526540400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24853-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24853-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/7A__SGOLens&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>6d83b20d</fingerprint><title>Publisher Correction: Shedding new light on the Crab with polarized X-rays</title><crawled>1526545207533</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>M.

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape. We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed1:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525899600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoling Dou, Shingo Shirahata, Hiroki Sugimoto&lt;/p&gt;

Monte Carlo (RMC) methods, have been applied to study some properties of the

configuration interaction (SDCI) wavefunctions with a valence quadruple zeta
atomic natural orbital (VQZ/ANO) basis set were used as trial wavefunctions.
Values for the potential energy curve, dissociation energy and dipole moment

from the potential energy curves—yield a value of 3.5 Å, in agreement with the

case, a conventional CCSD(T) calculation with an extended aug-pc-4 basis set
gives a much better agreement to experiment. On the contrary, the CCSD(T),
other MO and DFT methods are not able to reproduce correctly the large dipole

Interferon lambda (IFNλ) is a group of cytokines that belong to the IL-10 family. They exhibit antiviral activities against certain viruses during infection of the liver and mucosal tissues. Here we report that IFNλ restricts &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; replication of the β-herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV). However, IFNλR1-deficient (&lt;i&gt;Ifnλr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) mice were not preferentially susceptible to mCMV infection &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; during acute infection after systemic or mucosal challenge, or during virus persistence in the mucosa. Instead, our studies revealed that IFNλ influences NK cell responses during mCMV infection. &lt;i&gt;Ifnλr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited defective development of conventional interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-expressing NK cells in the spleen during mCMV infection whereas accumulation of granzyme B-expressing NK cells was unaltered. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, development of splenic IFNγ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; NK cells following stimulation with IL-12 or, to a lesser extent, IL-18 was abrogated by IFNλR1-deficiency. Thus, IFNλ regulates NK cell responses during mCMV infection and restricts virus replication &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; but is redundant in the control of acute and persistent mCMV replication within mucosal and non-mucosal tissues.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c2:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526504400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Silvia Gimeno Brias, Morgan Marsden, Jessica Forbester, Mathew Clement, Cordelia Brandt, Katherine Harcourt, Leanne Kane, Lucy Chapman, Simon Clare, Ian R.

Thus, IFNλ regulates NK cell responses during mCMV infection and restricts virus replication &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; but is redundant in the control of acute and persistent mCMV replication within mucosal and non-mucosal tissues.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197596</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>31837e37</fingerprint><title>Interferon lambda is required for interferon gamma-expressing NK cell responses but does not afford antiviral protection during acute and persistent murine cytomegalovirus infection</title><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><updated>1526504400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Silvia Gimeno Brias</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197596</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197596</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197596</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>Chromatin interactions measured by the 3C-based family of next generation technologies are becoming increasingly important for measuring the physical basis for regulatory interactions between different classes of functional domains in the genome.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Quick background for those not in the field: a great many three-dimensional molecules can exist in right-handed and left-handed mirror-image forms (enantiomers), exactly like pairs of shoes. They have the property of “chirality”. When this happens with drug compounds, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/28/right-hand-left-hand-either-hand&quot;&gt;generally the case&lt;/a&gt; that the two have different activities, because proteins in the body are chiral, too. Where that handedness comes from is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/12/15/chirality-from-chemical-supply-houses-to-life-as-we-know-it&quot;&gt;rather deep question&lt;/a&gt;. Separating enantiomers is generally done by using another chiral substance (making derivatives or salts of the parent compound or passing across a purification column loaded with some chiral solid phase].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of proposals in this vein, although it’s a minefield of subtlety (and of irreproducible experiments). But there are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/05/24/a_new_way_to_determine_chirality&quot;&gt;electromagnetic effects&lt;/a&gt; that are both theoretically feasible and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/05/enantioselectivity-with-microwaves&quot;&gt;experimentally real&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/05/09/science.aar4265.full&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt; seems to be another one. The paper starts off, I should note, with a brief history on the intersection of chirality and magnetism, a topic that involved heavy hitters like Pasteur, Lord Kelvin, and Pierre Curie in its early days. During my own career, I well recall reports of chiral induction in magnetic fields that had to be retracted to much embarrassment, so it does take some bravery to venture into this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors, a multicenter team from Israel, the US, Germany, and Poland, are taking advantage of a phenomenon called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). Simply put – and I’m not going to be able to put it at a much higher level – electron movement through molecules is affected by their chirality. And that means that charge distribution in two enantiomers has different spin polarization in each one. That led the group to wonder about the interaction of chiral molecules with perpendicularly-magnetized surfaces, which have been the subject of much research in thin-film “spintronic” applications. In theory, one enantiomer could be attracted to such a surface much more than the other, depending on the direction of the magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just what happens. They picked a test helical polyalanine peptide and a gold-layered ferromagnet film (the gold is to protect it from oxidation, and the behavior of the exact peptide on gold layers had already been studied in other contexts). Attaching nanoparticles to the peptide (for visualization) and exposing these to the surface showed (by electron microscopy) a dramatic difference based on the direction of the perpendicular magnetic field. In one direction, the particles stick, and in the other they don’t. If the magnetization is in-plane (instead of perpendicular), there’s no difference, and there’s no difference if you’re applying an external magnetic field instead. It has to be a field associated with the thin layer, and it has to be in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also prepared a 50/50 mix of D- and L-peptides, and this (as it should) shows no circular dichroism. But after multiple exposures to fresh magnetic surfaces, the solution was clearly enriched in one enantiomer, and began to show circular dichroism as expected, increasing with the number of exposures. They then set this up as a flow experiment, and the results were unmistakeable: flowing an an enantiomeric mixture of two peptides down an unmagnetized column gave the same racemic mixture out the other end. But when the surface was magnetized “perpendicular down”, they got a strong CD spectrum from the eluent, and when it was magnetized “perpendicular up”, they got the mirror-image CD spectrum: the other enantiomer. The D enantiomers interact with the down-magnetized surfaces and the L enantiomers with the up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just peptides, either. A DNA oligomer was shown to bind to one magnetization and not the other, and the effect was reproduced with the single amino acid cysteine. In each case the kinetics are different for different sorts of molecules, different at various concentrations, and different between the enantiomers. The system thus has to be tuned for the best separation, but the effect is real across all of them. And that immediately suggests a whole new kind of chromatography:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The enantioselective interaction of chiral molecules with a magnetic substrate, presented in this article, provides a potentially generic chromatographic method for enantioseparation, which does not require a specific separating column. Because the observed effect depends on the electrical polarizability of the system (that is accompanied by spin polarization) and because this polarization depends on the global structure of the chiral molecule, the method described here may also allow the separation of chiral molecules from a mixture of molecules, either chiral or achiral. In addition, this technique could potentially be applied for separating chiral molecules based on their secondary structure and/or for separating two secondary structures of the same chiral molecule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would appear that a completely new analytical method has been invented, and I very much look forward to seeing what can be made out of it. We’re going to have to learn to think about chiral separations in a completely different way than we’re used to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We assessed for the first time whether urinary free light chains (FLC) are independently associated with risk of ESRD in patients with CKD, and whether they offer incremental value in risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We measured urinary FLCs in 556 patients with CKD from a prospective cohort study. The association between urinary kappa/creatinine (KCR) and lambda/creatinine (LCR) ratios and development of ESRD was assessed by competing-risks regression (to account for the competing risk of death). The change in C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement were used to assess the incremental value of adding KCR or LCR to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;136 participants developed ESRD during a median follow-up time of 51 months.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We assessed for the first time whether urinary free light chains (FLC) are independently associated with risk of ESRD in patients with CKD, and whether they offer incremental value in risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We measured urinary FLCs in 556 patients with CKD from a prospective cohort study. The association between urinary kappa/creatinine (KCR) and lambda/creatinine (LCR) ratios and development of ESRD was assessed by competing-risks regression (to account for the competing risk of death). The change in C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement were used to assess the incremental value of adding KCR or LCR to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;136 participants developed ESRD during a median follow-up time of 51 months. Significant associations between KCR and LCR and risk of ESRD became non-significant after adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), although having a KCR or LCR &gt;75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centile remained independently associated with risk of ESRD. Neither KCR nor LCR as continuous or categorical variables provided incremental value when added to the KFRE for estimating risk of ESRD at two years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Urinary FLCs have an association with progression to ESRD in patients with CKD which appears to be explained to a degree by their correlation with eGFR and ACR. Levels above the 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centile do have an independent association with ESRD, but do not improve upon a current model for risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197043</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>c0c073a0</fingerprint><title>Association between urinary free light chains and progression to end stage renal disease in chronic kidney disease</title><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><updated>1525899600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Anthony Fenton</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197043</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197043</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197043</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;US government considers charging for popular Earth-observing data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US government considers charging for popular Earth-observing data, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04874-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04874-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;I﻿mages from Landsat satellites and agricultural-survey programme are freely available to scientists — but for how long?</description><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162f807aeb7:692544e:9f3b30f2</id><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524553200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;US government considers charging for popular Earth-observing data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US government considers charging for popular Earth-observing data, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04874-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04874-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;I﻿mages from Landsat satellites and agricultural-survey programme are freely available to scientists — but for how long?</content></content><unread>True</unread><engagement>1209</engagement><visual><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04874-y/d41586-018-04874-y_15713350.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><fingerprint>298d8599</fingerprint><title>US government considers charging for popular Earth-observing data</title><crawled>1524579675831</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Gabriel Popkin</name></author><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04874-y</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04874-y</originId><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04874-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.7b01177/20180515/images/medium/ct-2017-01177x_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01177&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is a key regulator of organelle physiology and the excessive increase in mitochondrial calcium is associated with the oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial calcium to inflammatory and coagulative responses in hepatocytes exposed to high glucose (HG) (33mM glucose). Treatment of HepG2 cells with HG for 24 h induced insulin resistance, as demonstrated by an impairment of insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. HepG2 treatment with HG led to an increase in mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake, while cytosolic calcium remained unchanged. Inhibition of MCU by lentiviral-mediated shRNA prevented mitochondrial calcium uptake and downregulated the inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6) and coagulative (PAI-1 and FGA) mRNA expression in HepG2 cells exposed to HG. The protection from HG-induced inflammation by MCU inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, MCU inhibition in HepG2 cells abrogated the phosphorylation of p38, JNK and IKKα/IKKβ in HG treated cells. Taken together, these data suggest that MCU inhibition may represent a promising therapy for prevention of deleterious effects of obesity and metabolic diseases.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e52:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525122000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ghodratollah Panahi, Parvin Pasalar, Mina Zare, Rosario Rizzuto, Reza Meshkani&lt;/p&gt;

That’s how it is in drug research, and how it is in science in general. The problems and questions we’re working on are bigger than any one nationality; we’re tackling these things as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s disquieting to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/584?rss=1&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. That article reports that the (quite nationalist) government in Hungary is causing trouble for universities there, specifically the Central European University, accusing it and some of its faculty members of being in the pay of opponents of the government. It’s especially sad to see the national science funding agency participate in such actions. Hungarian scientists were a profound influence on the 20th century; the country produced a run of mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and chemists that had colleagues at Los Alamos joking that they must be Martians in disguise. But they didn’t get to that point by trying to do only Pure Hungarian Research, because there’s no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than there is Pure American, Pure German, or Pure Chinese Research.A look at what Germany did to its own scientific establishment under the National Socialist government should be all that’s needed as an argument, but apparently not. These things are dangerous fantasies, because talent comes from everywhere (and it often doesn’t conform to any given government’s ideology, either). I have a strong feeling that the current Hungarian government would be denouncing John von Neumann as a secret agent of George Soros were he or his like alive today. And they’re doing their best to make sure that the country never produces another such figure, which is a loss for the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/china-to-roll-back-regulations-for-traditional-medicine-despite-safety-concerns-1.23038&quot;&gt;Here’s another example&lt;/a&gt; of nationalism at work, this time in drug research. The Chinese government is apparently planning to drop requirements for safety and efficacy testing of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapies. Xi Jinping himself is a big advocate, and what more do you need? Students who want to become TCM practitioners no longer need to pass the national medical exam to open their practices. Not only are these preparations getting easy regulatory treatment – the government is making it harder and harder for anyone to express any contrary opinions about them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With strong government support for the alternative medicines industry, Chinese censors have been quick to remove posts from the Internet that question its efficacy. On 23 October, an article on a medical news site that called for closer attention to the risks of aristolochic acid was removed from social media site WeChat. The story had been viewed more than 700,000 times in three days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debate over TCMs has been silenced before in China. Last year, a Beijing think tank — the Development Research Center of the State Council — proposed banning the practice of extracting Asiatic black bear bile, another common ingredient in TCMs. The think tank’s report questioned the remedy’s efficacy and suggested using synthetic alternatives. It was removed from the think tank’s website after the Chinese Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which supports the development of TCM, called it biased and demanded an apology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04886-8&quot;&gt;go to jail&lt;/a&gt; for criticizing this stuff. Now, I think the way that the US regulates (or doesn’t regulate) “dietary supplements” &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/11/04/the_herbal_supplement_industry_is_not_a_very_funny_joke&quot;&gt;is a disgrace&lt;/a&gt;, but this is insanely worse. China has a great many excellent scientists, in a great many fields, and in drug research in particular they’re working on joining the short list of countries who have their own research-based drug industry that can produce new therapies to help patients around the world. But this effort will not be aided by making it easier for the black bear bile industry. I leave aside for another time discussion of how some of these “remedies” are driving animals around the world to extinction, but that’s just another argument for actually seeing if any of these things work (or even cause actual harm instead), and &lt;em&gt;taking them off the market&lt;/em&gt; if they don’t. But the Chinese government has made the cynical calculation that promoting this stuff will pay off politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? There’s a connection between these two examples. Guess what the Hungarian government is interested in promoting? Traditional Chinese medicine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Government spokespeople declined to answer specific questions about CEU, but did address another flash point: the country’s growing embrace of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). On 16 April, Hungary’s University of Szeged signed an agreement with the Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine in Xianyang, China, to bring TCM researchers, medical experts, and lecturers to teach in the region. The University of Pécs in Hungary has had a similar arrangement since 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year, the Hungarian government also announced plans to allocate about €4.5 million ($5.3 million) to build a new institute with a whole floor dedicated to TCM at Semmelweis University, one of the most prestigious medical schools in Hungary. The government says it wants to bridge the gap between Western medicine and Eastern alternatives to improve Hungarian health care, and also strengthen the economic, political, and cultural ties between Hungary and China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would guess that the most important word in that last sentence is “economic”. It’s pretty strange to see the Hungarian government deciding that the honor of Hungary has to be protected by embracing Chinese herbal remedies, but I’m sure that there are plenty of idiotic speeches laying this connection out in soul-eroding detail. No, this sort of thing is bad news. The reason science works is that we ask questions, investigate them to the best of our abilities, and build on the results that we get &lt;em&gt;whether we like them or not&lt;/em&gt;. Wishful thinking doesn’t work so well. The physical world does what it does independent of anyone’s political agenda or nationalist sloganeering, and pretending otherwise is shameful and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Current Events</item><item>Snake Oil</item></keywords><crawled>1526043198836</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Nationalist Medicine?

Mechanical stability is a key feature in the regulation of structural scaffolding proteins and their functions. Despite the abundance of α-helical structures among the human proteome and their undisputed importance in health and disease, the fundamental principles of their behavior under mechanical load are poorly understood. Talin and α-catenin are two key molecules in focal adhesions and adherens junctions, respectively. In this study, we used a combination of atomistic steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, polyprotein engineering, and single-molecule atomic force microscopy (smAFM) to investigate unfolding of these proteins. SMD simulations revealed that talin rod α-helix bundles as well as α-catenin α-helix domains unfold through stable 3-helix intermediates. While the 5-helix bundles were found to be mechanically stable, a second stable conformation corresponding to the 3-helix state was revealed. Mechanically weaker 4-helix bundles easily unfolded into a stable 3-helix conformation. The results of smAFM experiments were in agreement with the findings of the computational simulations. The disulfide clamp mutants, designed to protect the stable state, support the 3-helix intermediate model in both experimental and computational setups. As a result, multiple discrete unfolding intermediate states in the talin and α-catenin unfolding pathway were discovered. Better understanding of the mechanical unfolding mechanism of α-helix proteins is a key step towards comprehensive models describing the mechanoregulation of proteins.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z2y475sR2a8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163032286b6:a8a5d:ed160cc3</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524776400000</published><recrawled>1525812124141</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vasyl V.

Massive amounts of fake news and conspiratorial content have spread over social media before and after the 2016 US Presidential Elections despite intense fact-checking efforts. How do the spread of misinformation and fact-checking compete? What are the structural and dynamic characteristics of the core of the misinformation diffusion network, and who are its main purveyors? How to reduce the overall amount of misinformation? To explore these questions we built Hoaxy, an open platform that enables large-scale, systematic studies of how misinformation and fact-checking spread and compete on Twitter. Hoaxy captures public tweets that include links to articles from low-credibility and fact-checking sources. We perform &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-core decomposition on a diffusion network obtained from two million retweets produced by several hundred thousand accounts over the six months before the election. As we move from the periphery to the core of the network, fact-checking nearly disappears, while social bots proliferate. The number of users in the main core reaches equilibrium around the time of the election, with limited churn and increasingly dense connections. We conclude by quantifying how effectively the network can be disrupted by penalizing the most central nodes. These findings provide a first look at the anatomy of a massive online misinformation diffusion network.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d73c:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524862800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chengcheng Shao, Pik-Mai Hui, Lei Wang, Xinwen Jiang, Alessandro Flammini, Filippo Menczer, Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia&lt;/p&gt;

Wild bees are essential pollinators whose survival partly depends on the capacity of their environment to offer a sufficient amount of nectar and pollen. Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a generalist mining bee, &lt;i&gt;Andrena cineraria&lt;/i&gt;, that forages and reproduces during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; was explained by the interaction between flower density in the grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators. Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed rape resources.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094061:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1527022800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Colin Van Reeth, Gaël Caro, Christian Bockstaller, Nadia Michel&lt;/p&gt;

Since development of plasmid gene therapy for therapeutic angiogenesis by J. Isner this approach was an attractive option for ischemic diseases affecting large cohorts of patients. However, first placebo-controlled clinical trials showed its limited efficacy questioning further advance to practice. Thus, combined methods using delivery of several angiogenic factors got into spotlight as a way to improve outcomes. This study provides experimental proof of concept for a combined approach using simultaneous delivery of VEGF165 and HGF genes to alleviate consequences of myocardial infarction (MI). However, recent studies suggested that angiogenic growth factors have pleiotropic effects that may contribute to outcome so we expanded focus of our work to investigate potential mechanisms underlying action of VEGF165, HGF and their combination in MI. Briefly, Wistar rats underwent coronary artery ligation followed by injection of plasmid bearing VEGF165 or HGF or mixture of these. Histological assessment showed decreased size of post-MI fibrosis in both—VEGF165- or HGF-treated animals yet most prominent reduction of collagen deposition was observed in VEGF165+HGF group. Combined delivery group rats were the only to show significant increase of left ventricle (LV) wall thickness. We also found dilatation index improved in HGF or VEGF165+HGF treated animals. These effects were partially supported by our findings of c-kit+ cardiac stem cell number increase in all treated animals compared to negative control. Sporadic Ki-67+ mature cardiomyocytes were found in peri-infarct area throughout study groups with comparable effects of VEGF165, HGF and their combination. Assessment of vascular density in peri-infarct area showed efficacy of both–VEGF165 and HGF while combination of growth factors showed maximum increase of CD31+ capillary density. To our surprise arteriogenic response was limited in HGF-treated animals while VEGF165 showed potent positive influence on a-SMA+ blood vessel density. The latter hinted to evaluate infiltration of monocytes as they are known to modulate arteriogenic response in myocardium. We found that monocyte infiltration was driven by VEGF165 and reduced by HGF resulting in alleviation of VEGF-stimulated monocyte taxis after combined delivery of these 2 factors. Changes of monocyte infiltration were concordant with a-SMA+ arteriole density so we tested influence of VEGF165 or HGF on endothelial cells (EC) that mediate angiogenesis and inflammatory response. In a series of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments we found that VEGF165 and HGF regulate production of inflammatory chemokines by human EC. In particular MCP-1 levels changed after treatment by recombinant VEGF, HGF or their combination and were concordant with NF-κB activation and monocyte infiltration in corresponding groups &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We also found that both–VEGF165 and HGF upregulated IL-8 production by EC while their combination showed additive type of response reaching peak values. These changes were HIF-2 dependent and siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-2α abolished effects of VEGF165 and HGF on IL-8 production. To conclude, our study supports combined gene therapy by VEGF165 and HGF to treat MI and highlights neglected role of pleiotropic effects of angiogenic growth factors that may define efficacy via regulation of inflammatory response and endothelial function.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709405b:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1527022800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pavel I.

This study provides experimental proof of concept for a combined approach using simultaneous delivery of VEGF165 and HGF genes to alleviate consequences of myocardial infarction (MI). However, recent studies suggested that angiogenic growth factors have pleiotropic effects that may contribute to outcome so we expanded focus of our work to investigate potential mechanisms underlying action of VEGF165, HGF and their combination in MI. Briefly, Wistar rats underwent coronary artery ligation followed by injection of plasmid bearing VEGF165 or HGF or mixture of these. Histological assessment showed decreased size of post-MI fibrosis in both—VEGF165- or HGF-treated animals yet most prominent reduction of collagen deposition was observed in VEGF165+HGF group. Combined delivery group rats were the only to show significant increase of left ventricle (LV) wall thickness. We also found dilatation index improved in HGF or VEGF165+HGF treated animals. These effects were partially supported by our findings of c-kit+ cardiac stem cell number increase in all treated animals compared to negative control. Sporadic Ki-67+ mature cardiomyocytes were found in peri-infarct area throughout study groups with comparable effects of VEGF165, HGF and their combination. Assessment of vascular density in peri-infarct area showed efficacy of both–VEGF165 and HGF while combination of growth factors showed maximum increase of CD31+ capillary density. To our surprise arteriogenic response was limited in HGF-treated animals while VEGF165 showed potent positive influence on a-SMA+ blood vessel density. The latter hinted to evaluate infiltration of monocytes as they are known to modulate arteriogenic response in myocardium. We found that monocyte infiltration was driven by VEGF165 and reduced by HGF resulting in alleviation of VEGF-stimulated monocyte taxis after combined delivery of these 2 factors. Changes of monocyte infiltration were concordant with a-SMA+ arteriole density so we tested influence of VEGF165 or HGF on endothelial cells (EC) that mediate angiogenesis and inflammatory response. In a series of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments we found that VEGF165 and HGF regulate production of inflammatory chemokines by human EC. In particular MCP-1 levels changed after treatment by recombinant VEGF, HGF or their combination and were concordant with NF-κB activation and monocyte infiltration in corresponding groups &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We also found that both–VEGF165 and HGF upregulated IL-8 production by EC while their combination showed additive type of response reaching peak values. These changes were HIF-2 dependent and siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-2α abolished effects of VEGF165 and HGF on IL-8 production. To conclude, our study supports combined gene therapy by VEGF165 and HGF to treat MI and highlights neglected role of pleiotropic effects of angiogenic growth factors that may define efficacy via regulation of inflammatory response and endothelial function.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197566</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>73d31abb</fingerprint><title>Angiogenic and pleiotropic effects of VEGF165 and HGF combined gene therapy in a rat model of myocardial infarction</title><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><updated>1527022800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Pavel I.

Adult male C57BL/6J mice have previously been reported to have motor and memory deficits after experimental closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI), without associated gross pathologic damage or neuroimaging changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging protocols. The presence of neurologic deficits, however, suggests neural damage or dysfunction in these animals. Accordingly, we undertook a histologic analysis of mice after TBI. Gross pathology and histologic analysis using Nissl stain and NeuN immunohistochemistry demonstrated no obvious tissue damage or neuron loss. However, Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed myelin injury in the optic tract, while Fluoro Jade B and silver degeneration staining revealed evidence of axonal neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and superior colliculus (detectable at 7 days, but not 24 hours, after injury). Fluoro Jade B staining was not detectable in other white matter tracts, brain regions or in cell somata. In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559161:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525986000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan K.

Background &lt;p&gt;Odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids (OCSFA) have been associated with potential health benefits. Although some OCSFA (e.g., C15:0 and C17:0) are found in meats and dairy products, sources and metabolism of C19:0 and C23:0 are relatively unknown, and the influence of non-dietary determinants, including genetic factors, on circulating levels of OCSFA is not established.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biological processes that influence circulating levels of OCSFA by investigating associations between genetic variation and OCSFA.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma phospholipid/erythrocyte levels of C15:0, C17:0, C19:0, and C23:0 among 11,494 individuals of European descent. We also investigated relationships between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lactase (&lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt;) gene, associated with adult-onset lactase intolerance, with circulating levels of dairy-derived OCSFA, and evaluated associations of candidate sphingolipid genes with C23:0 levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found no genome-wide significant evidence that common genetic variation is associated with circulating levels of C15:0 or C23:0. In two cohorts with available data, we identified one intronic SNP (rs13361131) in myosin X gene (&lt;i&gt;MYO10)&lt;/i&gt; associated with C17:0 level (P = 1.37×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;), and two intronic SNP (rs12874278 and rs17363566) in deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (&lt;i&gt;DLEU1)&lt;/i&gt; region associated with C19:0 level (P = 7.07×10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, when using a candidate-gene approach, we found evidence that three SNPs in &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; (rs11884924, rs16832067, and rs3816088) are associated with circulating C17:0 level (adjusted P = 4×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, nine SNPs in the ceramide synthase 4 (&lt;i&gt;CERS4)&lt;/i&gt; region were associated with circulating C23:0 levels (adjusted P&amp;lt;5×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that circulating levels of OCSFA may be predominantly influenced by non-genetic factors. SNPs associated with C17:0 level in the &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; gene may reflect genetic influence in dairy consumption or in metabolism of dairy foods.

SNPs associated with C23:0 may reflect a role of genetic factors in the synthesis of sphingomyelin.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196951</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>19a6a2ea</fingerprint><title>Genome-wide association meta-analysis of circulating odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids: Results from the CHARGE Consortium</title><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Marcia C. de Oliveira Otto</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196951</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196951</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196951</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas A.

Team SA involves a common perspective between two or more individuals regarding current environmental events, their meaning, and projected future status. Team SA has been theorized to be important for resuscitation team effectiveness. Accordingly, multidimensional frameworks of observable behaviors relevant to resuscitation teams are needed to understand more deeply the nature of team SA, its implications for team effectiveness, and whether it can be trained. A seven-dimension team resuscitation SA framework was developed following a literature review and consensus process using a modified Delphi approach with a group of content experts. We applied a pre-post design within a day-long team training program involving four video-recorded simulated resuscitation events and 42 teams across Canada. The first and fourth events represented “pre” and “post” training events, respectively. Teams were scored on SA five times within each 15-minute event. Distractions were introduced to investigate whether SA scores would be affected. The current study provides initial construct validity evidence for a new measure of SA and explicates SA&apos;s role in resuscitation teams.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fce:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526331600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas A.

Repositioning of the maxilla in orthognathic surgery is carried out for functional and aesthetic purposes. Pre-surgical planning tools can predict 3D facial appearance by computing the response of the soft tissue to the changes to the underlying skeleton. The clinical use of commercial prediction software remains controversial, likely due to the deterministic nature of these computational predictions. A novel probabilistic finite element model (FEM) for the prediction of postoperative facial soft tissues is proposed in this paper. A probabilistic FEM was developed and validated on a cohort of eight patients who underwent maxillary repositioning and had pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken. Firstly, a variables correlation assessed various modelling parameters. Secondly, a design of experiments (DOE) provided a range of potential outcomes based on uniformly distributed input parameters, followed by an optimisation. Lastly, the second DOE iteration provided optimised predictions with a probability range. A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee8:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525899600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paul G.

Extensive research revealed tremendous details about how plants sense pathogen effectors during effector-triggered immunity (ETI). However, less is known about downstream signaling events. In this report, we demonstrate that prolonged activation of MPK3 and MPK6, two &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; pathogen-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), is essential to ETI mediated by both coiled coil-nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (CNLs) and toll/interleukin-1 receptor nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (TNLs) types of R proteins. MPK3/MPK6 activation rapidly alters the expression of photosynthesis-related genes and inhibits photosynthesis, which promotes the accumulation of superoxide (O2•−) and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), two major reactive oxygen species (ROS), in chloroplasts under light. In the chemical-genetically rescued &lt;i&gt;mpk3 mpk6&lt;/i&gt; double mutants, ETI-induced photosynthetic inhibition and chloroplastic ROS accumulation are compromised, which correlates with delayed hypersensitive response (HR) cell death and compromised resistance. Furthermore, protection of chloroplasts by expressing a plastid-targeted cyanobacterial flavodoxin (pFLD) delays photosynthetic inhibition and compromises ETI. Collectively, this study highlights a critical role of MPK3/MPK6 in manipulating plant photosynthetic activities to promote ROS accumulation in chloroplasts and HR cell death, which contributes to the robustness of ETI. Furthermore, the dual functionality of MPK3/MPK6 cascade in promoting defense and inhibiting photosynthesis potentially allow it to orchestrate the trade-off between plant growth and defense in plant immunity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/feggFvBsPmE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163272479f8:1445:a96d255</id><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525381200000</published><recrawled>1526424487605</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jianbin Su, Liuyi Yang, Qiankun Zhu, Hongjiao Wu, Yi He, Yidong Liu, Juan Xu, Dean Jiang, Shuqun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Benthic algae fuel summer food webs in many sunlit rivers, and are hotspots for primary and secondary production and biogeochemical cycling. Concerningly, riverine benthic algal assemblages can become dominated by toxic cyanobacteria, threatening water quality and public health. In the Eel River in Northern California, over a dozen dog deaths have been attributed to cyanotoxin poisonings since 2000. During the summers of 2013–2015, we documented spatial and temporal patterns of cyanotoxin concentrations in the watershed, showing widespread distribution of anatoxin-a in benthic cyanobacterial mats. Solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) samplers were deployed weekly to record dissolved microcystin and anatoxin-a levels at 10 sites throughout the watershed, and 187 &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt;-dominated or &lt;i&gt;Phormidium-&lt;/i&gt;dominated cyanobacterial mat samples were collected from 27 locations to measure intracellular anatoxin-a (ATX) and microcystins (MCY). Anatoxin-a levels were higher than microcystin for both SPATT (mean MCY = 0.8 and ATX = 4.8 ng g resin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and cyanobacterial mat samples (mean MCY = 0.074 and ATX = 1.89 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). Of the benthic mats sampled, 58.9% had detectable anatoxin-a (max = 70.93 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW), while 37.6% had detectable microcystins (max = 2.29 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). SPATT cyanotoxin levels peaked in mid-summer in warm mainstem reaches of the watershed. This is one of the first documentations of widespread anatoxin-a occurrence in benthic cyanobacterial mats in a North American watershed.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7226:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526677200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Keith Bouma-Gregson, Raphael M.

This is one of the first documentations of widespread anatoxin-a occurrence in benthic cyanobacterial mats in a North American watershed.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197669</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>b40a272a</fingerprint><title>Widespread anatoxin-a detection in benthic cyanobacterial mats throughout a river network</title><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Keith Bouma-Gregson</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197669</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197669</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197669</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sruti S.

Although studies from pediatric cancers (largely acute lymphoblastic leukemia) have shown that patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy may experience decreased growth velocity during the treatment phase, no such data exist for retinoblastoma patients treated with systemic chemotherapy or ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC). The purpose of this study is to report growth patterns of our retinoblastoma (Rb) population who were treated with OAC in a retrospective, single center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) review of 341 patients treated between 2006 and 2016. Children who only received OAC were classified as naive; those who were treated initially with systemic chemotherapy and subsequently presented to our center for OAC were termed secondary; and a small group of patients who received single-agent systemic chemotherapy prior to OAC were labeled bridge. For all patients, height and weight were recorded at monthly intervals during OAC (short-term) and then annually during a follow-up period (long-term) up to 3 years after treatment. Excluded from this study were children who received external radiation therapy and those with genetic syndromes, which are independently associated with growth derangements. During OAC, there was no significant difference in growth velocity between the naïve and secondary groups. In either group, number of treatments also did not affect growth rate. Three years after the end of OAC, naïve patients were in the 68&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile by height (95% CI 61.30, 74.63) compared to secondary patients in the 61&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 51.1, 71.47). Both groups were in the same weight percentiles during the first two years of follow-up but at the three-year follow-up period, naïve patients were in the 63&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 57.4, 69.4) and secondary patients were in the 60&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 50.4, 69.7).

Background &lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). The exact influence of ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFL thickness (RNFLT) is unknown and was analysed in a subgroup of the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Global peripapillary RNFLT was measured in 3224 eyes of 1973 subjects (49% female) using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The association of age, sex, ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFLT was analysed using Pearson correlation coefficient and fitting a linear mixed model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the univariable analysis highest correlations were found for axial length (r = -0.27), spherical equivalent (r = 0.24), and glaucoma (r = -0.15) (p&amp;lt;0.0001, respectively). Other significant correlations with RNFLT were found for age, sex, intraocular pressure, systemic hypertension and systolic blood pressure, previous eye surgery, cholesterol, homocysteine, history of coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, apnoea, diabetes and alcohol intake, p&amp;lt;0.05, respectively. Body length, body weight, BMI, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1c, history of apoplexy, cognitive function, peripheral artery disease, tinnitus, migraine, nicotine intake, central corneal thickness, and pseudophakia were not significantly correlated with RNFLT. The regression model revealed a significant relationship between RNFLT and age in decades (p&amp;lt;0.02), spherical equivalent (p&amp;lt;0.0001), axial length (p&amp;lt;0.0001), glaucoma (p&amp;lt;0.0001), tinnitus (p = 0.04), apnoea (p = 0.047), homocysteine (p = 0.05) and alcohol intake &gt;10g/d for women and &gt;20g/d for men (p = 0.02). Glaucoma, apnoea, higher homocysteine, higher alcohol intake and higher axial length as well as age were related to decreased RNFLT while higher spherical equivalent or history for tinnitus were related to thicker RNFL.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;RNFLT is related to age, ocular parameters and lifestyle factors. Considering these parameters in normative databases could improve the evaluation of peripapillary RNFLT. It is necessary to evaluate if a reduction of alcohol intake as well as the therapy of apnea or high homocysteine levels could positively influence RNFLT.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094060:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1527022800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Julia Lamparter, Irene Schmidtmann, Alexander K.

The 2009 influenza pandemic, the variant H3N2v viruses in agricultural fairs and the zoonotic poultry H5N9 infections in China have highlighted the constant threat that influenza A viruses (IAV) present to people and animals. In this study we evaluated the effect of IAV vaccination on aerosol shedding in pigs housed in warm environmental conditions. Thirty-six, three-week old weaned pigs were obtained from an IAV negative herd and were randomly allocated to one of 4 groups: 1) a homologous vaccine group, 2) a heterologous multivalent vaccine group, 3) a heterologous monovalent group and, 4) a non-vaccinated group. After vaccination pigs were challenged with the triple reassortant A/Sw/IA/00239/04 H1N1 virus. Environmental temperature and relative humidity were recorded throughout the study. Nasal swabs, oral fluids and air samples were collected daily. All samples were tested by RRT-PCR and virus isolation was attempted on positive samples. Average temperature and relative humidity throughout the study were 27°C (80°F) and 53%, respectively. A significantly higher proportion of infected pigs was detected in the non-vaccinated than in the vaccinated group. Lower levels of nasal virus shedding were found in vaccinated groups compared to non-vaccinated group and IAV was not detected in air samples of any of the vaccinated groups. In contrast, positive air samples were detected in the non-vaccinated group at 1, 2 and 3 days post infection although the overall levels were considered low most likely due to the elevated environmental temperature. In conclusion, both the decrease in shedding and the increase in environmental temperature may have contributed to the inability to detect airborne IAV in vaccinated pigs.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761232:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526936400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Victor Neira, Matt Allerson, Cesar Corzo, Marie Culhane, Aaron Rendahl, Montserrat Torremorell&lt;/p&gt;

After vaccination pigs were challenged with the triple reassortant A/Sw/IA/00239/04 H1N1 virus. Environmental temperature and relative humidity were recorded throughout the study. Nasal swabs, oral fluids and air samples were collected daily. All samples were tested by RRT-PCR and virus isolation was attempted on positive samples. Average temperature and relative humidity throughout the study were 27°C (80°F) and 53%, respectively. A significantly higher proportion of infected pigs was detected in the non-vaccinated than in the vaccinated group. Lower levels of nasal virus shedding were found in vaccinated groups compared to non-vaccinated group and IAV was not detected in air samples of any of the vaccinated groups. In contrast, positive air samples were detected in the non-vaccinated group at 1, 2 and 3 days post infection although the overall levels were considered low most likely due to the elevated environmental temperature. In conclusion, both the decrease in shedding and the increase in environmental temperature may have contributed to the inability to detect airborne IAV in vaccinated pigs.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197600</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>209c6626</fingerprint><title>Detection of influenza A virus in aerosols of vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs in a warm environment</title><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><updated>1526936400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Victor Neira</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197600</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197600</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197600</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A visceral history of dinosaurs, the world through the nose of a dog and the psychological secrets of the plot twist: Books in brief&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A visceral history of dinosaurs, the world through the nose of a dog and the psychological secrets of the plot twist: Books in brief, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04933-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04933-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Barbara Kiser reviews five of the week’s best science picks.</description><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162f807aeb7:692544d:9f3b30f2</id><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524553200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A visceral history of dinosaurs, the world through the nose of a dog and the psychological secrets of the plot twist: Books in brief&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A visceral history of dinosaurs, the world through the nose of a dog and the psychological secrets of the plot twist: Books in brief, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04933-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04933-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Barbara Kiser reviews five of the week’s best science picks.</content></content><unread>True</unread><engagement>108</engagement><visual><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04933-4/d41586-018-04933-4_15713300.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><fingerprint>a86ae5f0</fingerprint><title>A visceral history of dinosaurs, the world through the nose of a dog and the psychological secrets of the plot twist: Books in brief</title><crawled>1524579675831</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Barbara Kiser</name></author><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04933-4</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04933-4</originId><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04933-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7d4:93d646dc</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-o?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.15.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>af8fabcd</fingerprint><keywords><item>Development, Genetics</item></keywords><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Making males and back again</title><author><name>Vignieri, S.</name></author><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-o?rss=1</link><published>1525974002000</published><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-o?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lester Y.

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1636f49ddb2:4e2d26:abeb7260</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526590800000</published><recrawled>1526589728774</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Milad Hobbi Mobarhan, Geir Halnes, Pablo Martínez-Cañada, Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn, Gaute T.

Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (&lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been widely related to neuropsychiatry disorders. The localization of ANKK1 in neural progenitors and its correlation with the cell cycle has suggested its participation in development. However, ANKK1 functions still need to be identified. Here, we have further characterized the ANKK1 localization &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, by using immunolabeling, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in the myogenic lineage. Histologic investigations in mice and humans revealed that ANKK1 is expressed in precursors of embryonic and adult muscles. In mice embryos, ANKK1 was found in migrating myotubes where it shows a polarized cytoplasmic distribution, while proliferative myoblasts and satellite cells show different isoforms in their nuclei and cytoplasm. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of ANKK1 protein isoforms along the myogenic progression showed the decline of nuclear ANKK1-kinase until its total exclusion in myotubes. In adult mice, ANKK1 was expressed exclusively in the Fast-Twitch muscles fibers subtype. The induction of glycolytic metabolism in C2C12 cells with high glucose concentration or treatment with berberine caused a significant increase in the &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Similarly, C2C12 cells under hypoxic conditions caused the increase of nuclear ANKK1. These results altogether show a relationship between &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation and the metabolism of muscles during development and in adulthood. Finally, we found ANKK1 expression in regenerative fibers of muscles from dystrophic patients. Future studies in ANKK1 biology and the pathological response of muscles will reveal whether this protein is a novel muscle disease biomarker.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219e:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526331600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Estrella Rubio-Solsona, Salvador Martí, Juan J.

Flightless saproxylic beetles were selected in order to study the impact of temporal and spatial discontinuity of forests. They were chosen because: (1) they are unable to fly, making them dispersal-limited species, (2) they have a saproxylic diet, which means they are closely linked to the forest, and (3), they have rarely been studied. Forest temporal continuity was expected to be the main factor explaining the presence of these species, modulated by the past and present amount of forest in the surrounding landscape. Twenty-seven forests, distributed into three zones, were sampled in southwestern France. Flightless saproxylic beetles were surveyed using a Winkler extractor and a Berlese funnel. Their presence/absence were modelled using generalised linear mixed models, with zone variable as random effect. Two species showed significant &lt;i&gt;zone&lt;/i&gt; effect and were only or more present in the zone with the highest present forest amount in a 0.5 km radius. In the model that converged, the only selected variable was the past amount of forest in the landscape. The size of the forest, the presence of dead wood and the forest temporal continuity were not included in this model. The importance of the amount of forest in the landscape supports the hypothesis that dispersal-limited species are affected by landscape characteristics. This study demonstrates an important link between the presence of &lt;i&gt;Dienerella clathrata&lt;/i&gt; and the amount of forest in the past, which led to an indicator species analysis being performed.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f426916:4a23bbb:3dd877af</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526590800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eugénie Cateau, Pierre-Alexis Herrault, David Sheeren, Sylvie Ladet, Hervé Brustel&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of two forms (CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CuS); and Cu nanoparticles (CuNP)) and dosages (standard 6.5 mg/kg (H), half of the standard (L)) of additional dietary Cu administered to growing rats on gastrointestinal and hepatic function and morphology. Copper in the form of CuNP vs CuS caused lower Cu faecal/urinal excretion and increased Cu accumulation in the brain tissue. Hepatic high-grade hydropic degeneration and necrotic lesions were observed only in the CuNP-H animals. In the lower gut, the dietary application of CuNP stifled bacterial enzymatic activity of caecal gut microbiota and resulted in lower SCFA production. That diminishing effect of CuNP on caecal microbiota activity was accompanied by a relative increase in the secretion of glycoside hydrolases by bacterial cells.

The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been decreasing globally, but the growing effects of HCV-related morbidity and mortality remain of concern. Advances in curative medicine, involving direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), have led many countries to aim to eradicate HCV. Information on epidemiology and disease burden is essential for national policy development. Thus, this study aimed to determine the HCV-related hepatic disease burden in areas of Thailand with high and average HCV prevalence in order to extrapolate the viral burden across Thailand. Patients previously diagnosed as positive for anti-HCV antibodies were recruited to assess chronic HCV infection (CHC) status, liver function, HCV-RNA level and hepatic fibrosis. The number of patients eligible for Universal Health Coverage (UC) scheme and the approximately required expenditure on interferon (IFN)-based treatment were estimated. In areas of both high (12%) and average (2%) HCV viremic prevalence, over half of the patients (52.2% to 62.5%) had advanced liver fibrosis (F3 and F4). A striking percentage of patients with F4 (38.9%) were found in the high-prevalence area, while comparable proportions of advanced liver fibrosis presented in the two areas and disease burden peaked at 50–59 years. Under the current UC program treatment scenario, 78–83% of CHC patients with stage F2–F4 fibrosis were eligible for treatment.

The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been decreasing globally, but the growing effects of HCV-related morbidity and mortality remain of concern. Advances in curative medicine, involving direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), have led many countries to aim to eradicate HCV. Information on epidemiology and disease burden is essential for national policy development. Thus, this study aimed to determine the HCV-related hepatic disease burden in areas of Thailand with high and average HCV prevalence in order to extrapolate the viral burden across Thailand. Patients previously diagnosed as positive for anti-HCV antibodies were recruited to assess chronic HCV infection (CHC) status, liver function, HCV-RNA level and hepatic fibrosis. The number of patients eligible for Universal Health Coverage (UC) scheme and the approximately required expenditure on interferon (IFN)-based treatment were estimated. In areas of both high (12%) and average (2%) HCV viremic prevalence, over half of the patients (52.2% to 62.5%) had advanced liver fibrosis (F3 and F4). A striking percentage of patients with F4 (38.9%) were found in the high-prevalence area, while comparable proportions of advanced liver fibrosis presented in the two areas and disease burden peaked at 50–59 years. Under the current UC program treatment scenario, 78–83% of CHC patients with stage F2–F4 fibrosis were eligible for treatment. The estimated expenditure required for overall CHC treatment across the whole country was 1,240 million USD at this current status, but the declining cost of generic DAA-based therapy may reduce the requirement to &amp;lt;90 million USD. This study provides information on the estimated number of CHC patients, liver disease burden and expenditure requirements for Thailand. To eliminate HCV by 2030, proactive government strategies raising public health to minimize transmission and emphasizing targeted screen-and-treatment programs, novel therapeutic guideline development for decentralizing treatment, and effective budget allocation are urgently needed.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196301</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>f2997682</fingerprint><title>Liver disease burden and required treatment expenditures for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Thailand: Implications for HCV elimination in the new therapeutic era, a population-based study</title><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><updated>1524603600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Rujipat Wasitthankasem</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196301</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196301</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196301</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-omics profiling of younger Asian breast cancers reveals distinctive molecular signatures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-omics profiling of younger Asian breast cancers reveals distinctive molecular signatures, Published online: 30 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04129-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04129-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;While breast cancer incidence in the Asia Pacific region is rising, the molecular basis remains poorly characterized.

There are only few reports regarding the role of lifetime drug or substance use in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology. In this study, we investigated the potential effect of drug or substance exposure on the onset of MS diagnosis. We conducted a population-based incident case control study in Tehran. Cases (n = 547) were 15–50 years old persons with MS identified from the Iranian Multiple Sclerosis Society (IMSS) register during August 7, 2013, and November 17, 2015. Population-based controls (n = 1057) were 15–50 years old and were recruited by random digit telephone dialing. Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighing (IPTW) using two sets of propensity scores (PSs) was used to estimate marginal incidence odds ratios (ORs) for MS contrasting pre-specified substance use. The estimated marginal OR was 6.03 (95% confidence interval: 3.54;10.3, using trimmed weights at the 95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile of the stabilized weight distribution) in both IPTW analyses comparing lifetime substance use (opioids, cannabis, inhalants, hallucinogens and stimulants) for at least one time monthly during a six-months or longer period vs. no such history of drug use. Subject to limitation of causal claims based on case-control studies, this study suggests that monthly drug or substance use for a period of at least six consecutive months, may increase the risk of MS by factor 3.5 or higher.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa3:34f43e70</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524603600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ibrahim Abdollahpour, Saharnaz Nedjat, Mohammad Ali Mansournia, Tibor Schuster&lt;/p&gt;

Bacteria belonging to the genus &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; have been frequently found in association with a wide variety of marine eukaryotic invertebrate hosts, indicative of their versatile and symbiotic lifestyle. A recent comparison of the sponge-associated &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; genomes has shed light on the mechanisms influencing a successful symbiotic association with sponges. In contrast, the genomic architecture of &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; bacteria associated with other marine hosts has received less attention. Here, we performed genus-wide comparative analyses of 18 &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; isolated from sponges, coral, tunicates, flatworm, and seawater. The analyses revealed a certain degree of commonality among the majority of sponge- and coral-associated bacteria. Isolates from other marine invertebrate host, tunicates, exhibited a genetic repertoire for cold adaptation and specific metabolic abilities including mucin degradation in the Antarctic tunicate-associated bacterium &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; sp.

Detection of mobile elements and genomic islands (GIs) in all bacterial members highlighted the role of horizontal gene transfer for the acquisition of novel genetic features, likely enhancing the bacterial ecological fitness.

Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß. Our findings define a novel role for AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes via its modulation of Wnt/ß-catenin and NF-κB signaling activities and the cross-talk between these two signaling pathways.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543e:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526590800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takeshi Minashima, Thorsten Kirsch&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings define a novel role for AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes via its modulation of Wnt/ß-catenin and NF-κB signaling activities and the cross-talk between these two signaling pathways.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197690</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>d53b7919</fingerprint><title>Annexin A6 regulates catabolic events in articular chondrocytes via the modulation of NF-κB and Wnt/ß-catenin signaling</title><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><updated>1526590800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Takeshi Minashima</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197690</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197690</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197690</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANKRD16 prevents neuron loss caused by an editing-defective tRNA synthetase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANKRD16 prevents neuron loss caused by an editing-defective tRNA synthetase, Published online: 16 May 2018;

Thiols can be deprotonated to form a thiolate, which affords a diverse range of enzymatic activity and modes for chemical modification of proteins. Parameters for modeling thiolates using molecular mechanical force fields have not yet been validated, in part due to the lack of structural data on thiolate solvation. Here, the CHARMM36 and Amber models for thiolates in aqueous solutions are assessed using free energy perturbation and QM/MM MD simulations. The hydration structure of methylthiolate was calculated from 1 ns of QM/MM MD (PBE0/def2-TZVP//TIP3P), which show that the water–S- distances are approximately 2 Å. The CHARMM thiolate parameters predict a thiolate S radius close to the QM/MM value and predict a hydration Gibbs energy of -331 kJ/mol, close to the experimental value of -318 kJ/mol. The cysteine thiolate model in the Amber force field underestimates the thiolate radius by 0.2 Å and overestimates the thiolate hydration energy by 119 kJ/mol because it uses the same Lennard-Jones parameters for thiolates as for thiols. A recent Drude polarizable model for methylthiolate with optimized thiolate parameters also performs well. SAPT2+ analysis indicates exchange repulsion is larger for the methylthiolate, consistent with it having a more diffuse electron density distribution in comparison to the parent thiol.

Disturbances in one-carbon metabolism, intracellular reactions involved in nucleotide synthesis and methylation, likely increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, results have been inconsistent. To explore whether this inconsistency could be explained by intertumoral heterogeneity, we evaluated a comprehensive panel of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers and some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in relation to the risk of molecular subtypes of CRC defined by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; oncogenes. This nested case-control study included 488 CRC cases and 947 matched controls from two population-based cohorts in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. We analyzed 14 biomarkers and 17 SNPs in prediagnostic blood and determined &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; mutation status in tumor tissue. In a multivariate network analysis, no variable displayed a strong association with the risk of specific CRC subtypes. A non-synonymous SNP in the &lt;i&gt;CTH&lt;/i&gt; gene, rs1021737, had a stronger association compared with other variables. In subsequent univariate analyses, participants with variant rs1021737 genotype had a decreased risk of &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt;-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.50, 1.05), and an increased risk of &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt;-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.07, 2.30), with weak evidence for heterogeneity (P&lt;sub&gt;heterogeneity&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01). This subtype-specific SNP association was not replicated in a case-case analysis of 533 CRC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (P = 0.85). In conclusion, we found no support for clear subtype-specific roles of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers and SNPs in CRC development, making differences in CRC molecular subtype distributions an unlikely explanation for the varying results on the role of one-carbon metabolism in CRC development across previous studies.

These findings can be useful to drive new experimental exploration on their role in adverse effects and efficacy of Casiopeinas.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/21/327718</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>eea4c105</fingerprint><title>Identification of Casiopeina II-gly secondary targets through a systems pharmacology approach [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1526944401181</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>de Anda-Jauregui, G.</name></author><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327718v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327718v1?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327718v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Yourkavitch, Kristen Hassmiller Lich, Valerie L.

Retention in care remains an important issue for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs according to WHO guidelines, formerly called the “Option B+” approach. The objective of this study was to examine how poverty, gender, and health system factors interact to influence women’s participation in PMTCT services. We used qualitative research, literature, and hypothesized variable connections to diagram causes and effects in causal loop models. We found that many factors, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, service design and quality, stigma, disclosure, spouse/partner influence, decision-making autonomy, and knowledge about PMTCT, influence psychosocial health, which in turn affects women’s participation in PMTCT services. Thus, interventions to improve psychosocial health need to address many factors to be successful. We also found that the design of PMTCT services, a modifiable factor, is important because it affects several other factors. We identified 66 feedback loops that may contribute to policy resistance—that is, a policy’s failure to have its intended effect. Our findings point to the need for a multipronged intervention to encourage women’s continued participation in PMTCT services and for longitudinal research to quantify and test our causal loop model.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721e:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526677200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Yourkavitch, Kristen Hassmiller Lich, Valerie L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Prolonged sitting and low activity—both common in older people—are associated with increased mortality and poorer health.

The stress-induced mutagenesis hypothesis postulates that in response to stress, bacteria increase their genome-wide mutation rate, in turn increasing the chances that a descendant is able to better withstand the stress. This has implications for antibiotic treatment: exposure to subinhibitory doses of antibiotics has been reported to increase bacterial mutation rates and thus probably the rate at which resistance mutations appear and lead to treatment failure. More generally, the hypothesis posits that stress increases evolvability (the ability of a population to generate adaptive genetic diversity) and thus accelerates evolution. Measuring mutation rates under stress, however, is problematic, because existing methods assume there is no death. Yet subinhibitory stress levels may induce a substantial death rate. Death events need to be compensated by extra replication to reach a given population size, thus providing more opportunities to acquire mutations. We show that ignoring death leads to a systematic overestimation of mutation rates under stress. We developed a system based on plasmid segregation that allows us to measure death and division rates simultaneously in bacterial populations. Using this system, we found that a substantial death rate occurs at the tested subinhibitory concentrations previously reported to increase mutation rate. Taking this death rate into account lowers and sometimes removes the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, even when antibiotics increase mutation rate, we show that subinhibitory treatments do not increase genetic diversity and evolvability, again because of effects of the antibiotics on population dynamics. We conclude that antibiotic-induced mutagenesis is overestimated because of death and that understanding evolvability under stress requires accounting for the effects of stress on population dynamics as much as on mutation rate. Our goal here is dual: we show that population dynamics and, in particular, the numbers of cell division are crucial but neglected parameters in the evolvability of a population, and we provide experimental and computational tools and methods to study evolvability under stress, leading to a reassessment of the magnitude and significance of the stress-induced mutagenesis paradigm.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YW43eur48VA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f5:f3bf0074</id><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526072400000</published><recrawled>1526060763996</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Frenoy, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;

Age estimation methods based on hard structures require a process of validation to confirm the periodical pattern of growth marks. Among such processes, one of the most used is the marginal increment ratio (MIR), which was stated to follow a sinusoidal cycle in a population. Despite its utility, in most cases, its implementation has lacked robust statistical analysis. Accordingly, we propose a modeling approach for the temporal periodicity of growth increments based on single and second order harmonic functions. For illustrative purposes, the MIR periodicities for two geoduck species (&lt;i&gt;Panopea generosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Panopea globosa&lt;/i&gt;) were modeled to identify the periodical pattern of growth increments in the shell. This model identified an annual periodicity for both species but described different temporal patterns. The proposed procedure can be broadly used to objectively define the timing of the peak, the degree of symmetry, and therefore, the synchrony of band deposition of different species on the basis of MIR data.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b7:91749e5b</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524690000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by José Angel Hidalgo-de-la-Toba, Enrique Morales-Bojórquez, Sergio Scarry González-Peláez, J.

The proposed procedure can be broadly used to objectively define the timing of the peak, the degree of symmetry, and therefore, the synchrony of band deposition of different species on the basis of MIR data.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196189</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>943470de</fingerprint><title>Modeling the temporal periodicity of growth increments based on harmonic functions</title><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><updated>1524690000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>José Angel Hidalgo-de-la-Toba</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196189</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196189</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196189</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elena Lopez-Diez, Sonia Perez, Manuel Carballo, Amparo Iñarrea, Angel de la Orden, Maximo Castro, Moises Rodríguez, Sheila Almuster, Ruben Montero, Miguel Perez, Jorge Sanchez, Antonio Ojea&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4226c:5785ab88</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525726800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elena Lopez-Diez, Sonia Perez, Manuel Carballo, Amparo Iñarrea, Angel de la Orden, Maximo Castro, Moises Rodríguez, Sheila Almuster, Ruben Montero, Miguel Perez, Jorge Sanchez, Antonio Ojea&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197138</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>300e8d70</fingerprint><title>Correction: Lifestyle factors and oncogenic papillomavirus infection in a high-risk male population</title><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><updated>1525726800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Elena Lopez-Diez</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197138</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197138</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197138</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Role of Electrostatic Repulsion on Increasing Surface Activity of Anionic Surfactants in the Presence of Hydrophilic Silica Nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Role of Electrostatic Repulsion on Increasing Surface Activity of Anionic Surfactants in the Presence of Hydrophilic Silica Nanoparticles, Published online: 08 May 2018;

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are one of the important factors in controlling gene expression and elucidation of their roles has been attracting great interest. We have developed an improved method for analyzing a large variety of mutant CRE sequences in a simple and high-throughput manner. In our approach, mutant CREs with unique barcode sequences were obtained by biased randomization in a single PCR amplification. The original T7 promoter sequence was randomized by biased randomization, and the target number of base substitutions was set to be within the range of 0 to 5. The DNA library and subsequent transcribed RNA library were sequenced by next generation sequencers (NGS) to quantify transcriptional activity of each mutant. We succeeded in producing a randomized T7 promoter library with high coverage rate at each target number of base substitutions. In a single NGS analysis, we quantified the transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants. We confirmed that the bases from −9 to −7 play an important role in the transcriptional activity of the T7 promoter. This information coincides with the previous researches and demonstrated the validity of our methodology. Furthermore, using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; transcription/translation system, we found that transcriptional activities of these T7 variants were well correlated with the resultant protein abundance. We demonstrate that our method enables simple and high-throughput analysis of the effects of various CRE mutations on transcriptional regulation.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4225c:5785ab88</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525726800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Komura, Wataru Aoki, Keisuke Motone, Atsushi Satomura, Mitsuyoshi Ueda&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the nationwide seasonal peaks, risk factors, and utilization of medical resources of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization (RSVH) in preterm infants in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;A Taiwan nationwide birth cohort was extracted from the Birth Certificate Application Database during 2007–2009 and prospectively linked to the National Health Insurance database. We evaluated the seasonal peaks and risk factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with the RSVH of preterm infants. The length of hospital stays (LOS), care in intensive care unit (ICU), and use of mechanical ventilation (MV) were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan, three seasonal peaks and two seasonal peaks of RSVH in preterm infants with BPD and without BPD, respectively. Preterm infants had significantly higher RSVH rate than term infants (2.6% vs 0.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants born at 29–35 weeks of gestational age (wGA) with BPD had significantly higher RSVH rate than those without BPD (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001).

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The annual increase in costs and the quality of life of survivors of cardiac arrest are major concerns. This study used National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to evaluate the 1-year survival rate and the annual healthcare costs of survivors after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective, fixed-cohort study conducted from 2006 to 2012, involved 2 million individuals randomly selected from the NHIRD of Taiwan. Adult patients at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with cardiac arrest were enrolled. Survival was followed up for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 2,256 patients were enrolled. The survivor cohort accounted for 4% (89/2256) of the study population. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the survival and non-survival cohorts, with the exceptions of gender (male: survival vs. non-survival, 50.6% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.007), diabetes mellitus (49.4% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.009), and acute coronary syndrome (44.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.010). Only 38 (1.7%) patients survived for &gt; 1 year. The mean re-admission to hospital during the 1-year follow up was 73.5 (SD: 110.2) days. The mean healthcare cost during the 1-year follow up was $12,953. Factors associated with total healthcare costs during the 1-year follow up were as follows: city or county of residence, being widowed, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (city or county of residence, β: -23,604, p &amp;lt; 0.001; being widowed, β: 25,588, p = 0.049; COPD, β: 14,438, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a great burden of the annual healthcare costs of survivors of cardiac arrest.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The annual increase in costs and the quality of life of survivors of cardiac arrest are major concerns. This study used National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to evaluate the 1-year survival rate and the annual healthcare costs of survivors after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective, fixed-cohort study conducted from 2006 to 2012, involved 2 million individuals randomly selected from the NHIRD of Taiwan. Adult patients at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with cardiac arrest were enrolled. Survival was followed up for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 2,256 patients were enrolled. The survivor cohort accounted for 4% (89/2256) of the study population. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the survival and non-survival cohorts, with the exceptions of gender (male: survival vs. non-survival, 50.6% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.007), diabetes mellitus (49.4% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.009), and acute coronary syndrome (44.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.010). Only 38 (1.7%) patients survived for &gt; 1 year. The mean re-admission to hospital during the 1-year follow up was 73.5 (SD: 110.2) days. The mean healthcare cost during the 1-year follow up was $12,953. Factors associated with total healthcare costs during the 1-year follow up were as follows: city or county of residence, being widowed, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (city or county of residence, β: -23,604, p &amp;lt; 0.001; being widowed, β: 25,588, p = 0.049; COPD, β: 14,438, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a great burden of the annual healthcare costs of survivors of cardiac arrest.

To examine the origin of seizures induced by severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, The EEG characteristics of seizures were analyzed in newborns with and without severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the specificity. In total, 931 patients had a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level of 340–425 μmol/L, only 2 of whom had seizures. Compared to patients with hyperbilirubinemia and a TSB level of 340–425 μmol/L, those with a TSB level &gt;425 μmol/L had a significant risk of seizure (OR = 213.2, 95% CI = 113.0–405.8, P&amp;lt;0.001). Of all 28 patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia and seizure, 26 had seizures that originated in the temporal and/or occipital lobe. In seizure patients without severe hyperbilirubinemia, origination in the temporal/occipital and other lobes occurred in 19 and 117 cases, respectively. Compared to the risk of seizure origination in the temporal and/or occipital lobe in other diseases, the risk in patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia was increased by approximately 80 times (OR = 80.1, 95% CI = 28.3–226.4, P&amp;lt;0.001). Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia can selectively induce temporal and occipital lobe seizures. This is the first report of a new syndrome with the same etiology and electrophysiological features as epilepsy.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f77:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526072400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lian Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

When core body temperature increases, appetite and food consumption decline. A higher core body temperature can occur during exercise, during exposure to warm environmental temperatures, or during a fever, yet the mechanisms that link relatively warm temperatures to appetite suppression are unknown. A recent study in &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates that neurons in the mouse hypothalamus that express pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), a neural population well known to suppress food intake, also express a temperature-sensitive ion channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Slight increases in body temperature cause a TRPV1-dependent increase in activity in POMC neurons, which suppresses feeding in mice. Taken together, this study suggests a novel mechanism linking body temperature and food-seeking behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1bk6Jjx1vEo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1633bba0164:e03f8c:abeb7260</id><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525726800000</published><recrawled>1525716787382</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria A.

This has led to numerous studies providing results of segmentation of chromosome sequences of different species into so called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). As the number of such studies grows steadily and many of them make claims about the perceived differences between TAD structures observed in different conditions, there is a growing need for good measures of similarity (or dissimilarity) between such segmentations. We provide here a BP score, which is a relatively simple distance metric based on the bipartite matching between two segmentations. In this paper, we provide the rationale behind choosing specifically this function and show its results on several different datasets, both simulated and experimental. We show that not only the BP score is a proper metric satisfying the triangle inequality, but that it is providing good granularity of scores for typical situations occuring between different TAD segmentations. We also introduce local variant of the BP metric and show that in actual comparisons between experimental datasets, the local BP score is correlating with the observed changes in gene expression and genome methylation. In summary, we consider the BP score a good foundation for analysing the dynamics of chromosome structures. The methodology we present in this work could be used by many researchers in their ongoing analyses making it a popular and useful tool.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162ff14b3a9:7dd720:9f3b30f2</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524639600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Studying the 3D structure of chromosomes is an emerging field flourishing in recent years because of rapid development of experimental approaches for studying chromosomal contacts.

The polymorphisms at the α-chain of the IL-7 receptor (&lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt;) have been related to T-cell homeostasis and development and may contribute to immune system deregulation. In the present study, we analyzed the association between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms and the progression of liver fibrosis in patients infected with HCV. We carried out a retrospective study with a design consisting of repeated measurements in 187 HCV-infected patients, to study the risk prediction of liver fibrosis progression using genetic factors. We genotyped the rs6897932, rs987106 and rs3194051 &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms using the Agena Bioscience’s MassARRAY. Transient elastography was used to measure liver stiffness. The used cut-offs were: &amp;lt;7.1 kPa (F0-F1), 7.1–9.4 kPa (F2; significant fibrosis), 9.5-12.4 kPa (F3; advanced fibrosis), and ≥12.5 kPa (F4; cirrhosis). All HCV genotypes were analyzed. The median of follow-up time was 47.9 months. Baseline liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values did not show significant statistical differences for &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes (p&gt;0.05). In univariate analysis, the rs6897932 T allele had a positive relationship with an increase in LSM (arithmetic mean ratio (AMR) = 1.21 (95%CI = 1.08; 1.36); p = 0.001), progression to advanced fibrosis (F≥3) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.51 (95%CI = 1.29; 4.88); p = 0.006) and progression to cirrhosis (F4) (OR = 2.71 (95%CI = 0.94; 5.03); p = 0.069). In multivariable analysis, the rs6897932 T allele was related to a higher increase of LSM values during follow-up (adjusted AMR = 1.27 (95%CI = 1.13; 1.42); p&amp;lt;0.001) and higher odds of progression to advanced fibrosis [adjusted OR = 4.46 (95%CI = 1.87; 10.62); p = 0.001], and progression to cirrhosis [adjusted OR = 3.92 (95%CI = 1.30; 11.77); p = 0.015]. Regarding &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and rs3194051 polymorphisms, we did not find significant results except for the relationship between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and the increase in LSM values [adjusted OR = 1.12 (95%CI = 1.02; 1.23); p = 0.015]. The &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs6897932 polymorphism seems to be related to increased risk of liver fibrosis progression in HCV-infected patients. Thus, the rs6897932 polymorphism could be related to the physiopathology of CHC and might be used to successfully stratify the risk of CHC progression.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee2:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525899600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by María Ángeles Jiménez-Sousa, Ana Zaida Gómez-Moreno, Daniel Pineda-Tenor, Luz Maria Medrano, Juan José Sánchez-Ruano, Amanda Fernández-Rodríguez, Tomas Artaza-Varasa, José Saura-Montalbán, Sonia Vázquez-Morón, Pablo Ryan, Salvador Resino&lt;/p&gt;

By extracting and extending this information (using the overlaps of the reads), the haplotypes of an individual can be obtained.

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The rapid and high-yield method has great potential for commercial manufacturing of policosanol.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b81:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526418000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinju Ma, Liyi Ma, Hong Zhang, Zhongquan Zhang, Youqiong Wang, Kai Li, Xiaoming Chen&lt;/p&gt;

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing dietary fish oil (FO) with palm oil (PO) in juvenile Nile tilapia, &lt;i&gt;Oreochromis niloticus&lt;/i&gt; (9.34± 0.02g initial weight) with emphasis on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities as well as serum biochemical parameters. Also, lysozyme activity (LYZ), respiratory burst (RB), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and resistance to &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus iniae&lt;/i&gt; were investigated. Fish were stocked in 15 rectangular fiber glass tanks (150× 60× 40 cm) at 40 fish per tank with water maintained at 210 litres. Fish were fed five isonitrogenous (33% crude protein) and isolipidic (10% lipid) diets with PO included at 0% (0% PO), 25% (25% PO), 50% (50%PO), 75% (75% PO) and 100% (100% PO) for 8 weeks. The findings demonstrated that growth, and feed utilization was not compromised when PO was used in place of FO either partially or totally. Except for protease activity which was not significantly altered, lipase and amylase activities were significantly altered when FO was replaced with PO. There were no significant differences among treatments for CAT, SOD and LYZ. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) in fish fed 100% PO was significantly lower than all other groups whiles total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of fish fed 0% PO was significantly higher than all other groups. Fish fed 0% PO, 25% PO and 50% PO had glutathione reductase (GR) significantly higher than fish fed 75% PO and 100% PO. RB in fish fed 0% PO were significantly lower than fish fed 75% PO and 100% PO. Also, fish fed 0% PO had significantly lower total protein (TP) compared with groups fed 50% PO and 75% PO. Fish fed diets with PO had similar resistance ability to &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus iniae&lt;/i&gt; as those fed diets with FO. However, the liver function was likely to be compromised due to the increase in aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatas (ALP) along increasing PO inclusion levels. AST, total protein, triacylglycerol (TAG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly higher (p&amp;lt;0.05) in groups fed higher levels of PO. This study therefore concludes that feeding tilapia fingerlings with diets containing PO affects antioxidant and innate immune parameters negatively due to the reduction in LYS, TAC, GR, MDA, CAT, SOD and GSHpx.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67af:91749e5b</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524690000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Larbi Ayisi, Jinliang Zhao, Jun-Wei Wu&lt;/p&gt;

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a hematopoietic malignancy originating from T-cell progenitors in which differentiation is blocked at early stages. Physiological expression of specific NKL homeobox genes obeys a hematopoietic NKL-code implicated in the process of lymphopoiesis while in differentiated T-cells these genes are silenced. We propose that this developmental expression pattern underlies the observation that NKL homeobox genes are the most ubiquitous group of transcription factors deregulated in T-ALL, including TLX1, TLX3, NKX2-5 and NKX3-1. Here, we describe a novel member of the NKL homeobox gene subclass, NKX3-2 (BAPX1), which is aberrantly activated in 18% of pediatric T-ALL patients analyzed while being normally expressed in developing spleen. Identification of NKX3-2 expression in T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM qualified these cells to model its deregulation and function in a leukemic context. Genomic and chromosomal analyses demonstrated normal configuration of the NKX3-2 locus at chromosome 4p15, thus excluding cytogenetic dysregulation. Comparative expression profiling analysis of NKX3-2 patient data revealed deregulated activity of BMP- and MAPK-signalling. These candidate pathways were experimentally confirmed to mediate aberrant NKX3-2 expression. We also show that homeobox gene SIX6, plus MIR17HG and GATA3 are downstream targets of NKX3-2 and plausibly contribute to the pathogenesis of this malignancy by suppressing T-cell differentiation. Finally, NKL homeobox gene NKX2-5 was activated by NKX3-2 in CCRF-CEM and by FOXG1 in PEER, representing mutually inhibitory activators of this translocated oncogene. Together, our findings reveal a novel oncogenic NKL homeobox gene subclass member which is aberrantly expressed in a large subset of T-ALL patients and participates in a deregulated gene network likely to arise in developing spleen.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559158:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525986000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Nagel, Corinna Meyer, Maren Kaufmann, Margarete Zaborski, Roderick A.

Our aims were to quantify and map the plant sub regions of the the Caatinga, that covers 844,453 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is the largest block of seasonally dry forest in South America. We performed spatial analyses of the largest dataset of woody plant distributions in this region assembled to date (of 2,666 shrub and tree species; 260 localities), compared these distributions with the current phytogeographic regionalizations, and investigated the potential environmental drivers of the floristic patterns in these sub regions. Phytogeographical regions were identified using quantitative analyses of species turnover calculated as Simpson dissimilarity index. We applied an interpolation method to map NMDS axes of compositional variation over the entire extent of the Caatinga, and then classified the compositional dissimilarity according to the number of biogeographical sub regions identified a priori using k-means analysis. We used multinomial logistic regression models to investigate the influence of contemporary climatic productivity, topographic complexity, soil characteristics, climate stability since the last glacial maximum, and the human footprint in explaining the identified sub regions. We identified nine spatially cohesive biogeographical sub regions. Current productivity, as indicated by an aridity index, was the only explanatory variable retained in the best model, explaining nearly half of the floristic variability between sub regions. The highest rates of endemism within the Caatinga were in the Core and Periphery Chapada Diamantina sub regions. Our findings suggest that the topographic complexity, soil variation, and human footprint in the Caatinga act on woody plant distributions at local scales and not as determinants of broad floristic patterns. The lack of effect of climatic stability since the last glacial maximum probably results from the fact that a single measure of climatic stability does not adequately capture the highly dynamic climatic shifts the region suffered during the Pleistocene. There was limited overlap between our results and previous Caatinga classifications.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d73d:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524862800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Augusto C.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the clinical characters and effect of iridociliary cysts among patients who had undergone posterior phakic intraocular lens implantation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total 1569 eyes of 866 high myopia patients, who underwent phakic intraocular lens implantation from 1 September 2011 to 31 August 2016, was included in this prospective cohort study. These patients were followed up for more than 12 months postoperatively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the study period, 218 eyes (14%) of 154 patients were diagnosed with iridociliary cysts by ultrasound biomicroscopy. There were 74.3% patients with unilateral cysts and the cysts tended to have occurred in patients ages 20 to 30 years old (22%). The location of the cysts varied with temporal position as the most (50%) and superior position as the least (9.6%). After 1 week postoperative follow-up, there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between the cysts group and no cysts group, but the proportion of 20/20 or better uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and the 2 types of vector astigmatism.

Intraocular pressure (IOP), refraction, and vault remained stable at different time points of the follow-up period, while vault of cysts patients tend to be lower than patients without cysts at more than 12 months.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Iridociliary cysts were more common than estimated and it had no impact on Phakic Intraocular Lens implantation because there was no clue to show significantly difference on postoperative clinical outcomes between the patients with and without iridociliary cysts in this study.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196460</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>20693505</fingerprint><title>Iridociliary cysts do not impact on posterior phakic intraocular lens implantation for high myopia correction: A prospective cohort study in 1569 eyes</title><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><updated>1524776400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Xi Zhang</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196460</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196460</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196460</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00150/20180521/images/medium/cb-2018-00150t_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00150&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Using simulated and real multi-omic data, we find that tICA outperforms established methods in identifying biological sources of data variation at a significantly reduced computational cost. Using two independent multi cell-type EWAS, we further demonstrate how tICA can identify, in the absence of genotype information, mQTLs at a higher sensitivity than competing multi-way algorithms. We validate mQTLs found with tICA in an independent set, and demonstrate that approximately 75$\%$ of mQTLs are independent of blood cell subtype. In an application to multi-omic cancer data, tICA identifies many gene modules whose expression variation across tumors is driven by copy number or DNA methylation changes, but whose deregulation relative to the normal state is independent such alterations, an important finding that we confirm by direct analysis of individual data types. In summary, tICA is a powerful novel algorithm for decomposing multi-omic data, which will be of great value to the research community.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163506186b5:1e2a223:2835af05</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526022000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>There is an increased need for integrative analyses of multi-omic data.

As the development of new classes of antibiotics slows, bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem. A potential solution is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth, anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial clearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule 7 coupled polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to host cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model consists of two physical compartments: the host cells and the exudate. It is found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the host cells and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the host cells into the exudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the bacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or continuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible. Lastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our mathematical model.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MQif6tb7BiM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1632717282b:4969c1:a96d255</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525381200000</published><recrawled>1525369329029</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paul A.

Merosin deficient congenital muscular dystrophy 1A (MDC1A) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;LAMA2&lt;/i&gt; gene leading to severe and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Although over 350 causative mutations have been identified for MDC1A, no treatment is yet available. There are many therapeutic approaches in development, but the lack of natural history data of the mouse model and standardized outcome measures makes it difficult to transit these pre-clinical findings to clinical trials. Therefore, in the present study, we collected natural history data and assessed pre-clinical outcome measures for the &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model using standardized operating procedures available from the TREAT-NMD Alliance. Wild type and &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice were subjected to five different functional tests from the age of four to 32 weeks. Non-tested control groups were taken along to assess whether the functional test regime interfered with muscle pathology. Respiratory function, body weights and creatine kinase levels were recorded. Lastly, skeletal muscles were collected for further histopathological and gene expression analyses. Muscle function of &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice was severely impaired at four weeks of age and all mice lost the ability to use their hind limbs. Moreover, respiratory function was altered in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Interestingly, the respiration rate was decreased and declined with age, whereas the respiration amplitude was increased in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice when compared to wild type mice. Creatine kinase levels were comparable to wild type mice. Muscle histopathology and gene expression analysis revealed that there was a specific regional distribution pattern of muscle damage in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Gastrocnemius appeared to be the most severely affected muscle with a high proportion of atrophic fibers, increased fibrosis and inflammation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL-TL) was proposed as a biomarker of cancer risk. Recent scientific evidence suggested PBL-TL plays a diverse role in different cancers. Inconsistent results were obtained on PBL-TL in relation to breast cancer risk and specifically to the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The aim of the present case-control study was to analyse the correlation between family history of breast cancer or presence of a BRCA mutation and PBL-TL in the hypothesis that TL is a modifier of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;PBL-TL was measured using the real-time quantitative PCR method in DNA for 142 cases and 239 controls. All the women enrolled were characterized for cancer family history. A subgroup of 48 women were classified for the presence of a BRCA mutation. PBL-TL were summarized as means and standard deviations, and compared by standard analysis of variance. A multivariable Generalised Linear Model was fitted to the data with PBL-TL as the dependent variable, case/control status and presence of a BRCA/VUS mutation as factors, and age in 4 strata as a covariate.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Age was significantly associated with decreasing PBL-TL in controls (p = 0.01), but not in BC cases. The telomere length is shorter in cases than in controls after adjusting for age. No effect on PBL-TL of BMI, smoke nor of the most common risk factors for breast cancer was observed. No association between PBL-TL and family history was detected both in BC cases and controls. In the multivariate model, no association was observed between BRCA mutation and decreased PBL-TL. A statistically significant interaction (p = 0.031) between case-control status and a BRCA-mutation/VUS was observed, but no effect was detected for the interaction of cancer status and BRCA or VUS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study fails to provide support to the hypothesis that PBL-TL is associated with the risk of hereditary BC, or that is a marker of inherited mutations in BRCA genes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122d:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526936400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Pavanello, Liliana Varesco, Viviana Gismondi, Paolo Bruzzi, Claudia Bolognesi&lt;/p&gt;

A statistically significant interaction (p = 0.031) between case-control status and a BRCA-mutation/VUS was observed, but no effect was detected for the interaction of cancer status and BRCA or VUS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study fails to provide support to the hypothesis that PBL-TL is associated with the risk of hereditary BC, or that is a marker of inherited mutations in BRCA genes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197522</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>e89b5183</fingerprint><title>Leucocytes telomere length and breast cancer risk/ susceptibility: A case-control study</title><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><updated>1526936400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Sofia Pavanello</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197522</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197522</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197522</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>The patterning of the spine of a zebrafish is controlled by the notochord, a rod-like structure that supports and instructs the developing embryo.</description><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163692f68cb:403a7d4:3dd877af</id><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The patterning of the spine of a zebrafish is controlled by the notochord, a rod-like structure that supports and instructs the developing embryo.</content></summary><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37288</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37288</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>52ee1152</fingerprint><keywords><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><crawled>1526478104779</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Patterning the spine</title><author><name>harris@genetics.med.harvard.edu (Gloria Arratia)</name></author><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37288</link><published>1526428800000</published><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37288</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hector W.

Our observations demonstrate that ligand binding to a protein can be monitored in real time and in a label-free manner by recording the membrane capacitance.</content></summary><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34944</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34944</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><fingerprint>7cbdabc0</fingerprint><keywords><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><crawled>1524743432713</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>A label-free approach to detect ligand binding to cell surface proteins in real time</title><author><name>walter.sandtner@meduniwien.ac.at (Matej Hotka)</name></author><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34944</link><published>1524700800000</published><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34944</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00064/20180511/images/medium/mp-2018-000642_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00064&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm). In addition, a moderate nitrogen rate (240 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) could increase root growth, especially in the shallow soil layers. The differences observed with the minirhizotron method were clearer than those observed with the soil coring method.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7f:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526072400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Chen, Liantao Liu, Zhanbiao Wang, Hongchun Sun, Yongjiang Zhang, Zhanyuan Lu, Cundong Li&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Grapevine Pinot gris virus&lt;/i&gt; (GPGV) is a widely distributed grapevine pathogen that has been associated to the grapevine leaf mottling and deformation disease. With the aim of better understanding the disease epidemiology and providing efficient control strategies a specific and quantitative duplex TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay has been developed. This method has allowed reliable quantitation of the GPGV titer ranging from 30 up to 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; transcript copies, with a detection limit of 70 viral copies in plant material. The assay targets a grapevine internal control that reduces the occurrence of false negative results, thus increasing the diagnostic sensitivity of the technique. Viral isolates both associated and non-associated to symptoms from Greece, Slovakia and Spain have been successfully detected. The method has also been applied to the absolute quantitation of GPGV in its putative transmission vector &lt;i&gt;Colomerus vitis&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the viral titer present in single mites has been determined. In addition, in the current study a new polymorphism in the GPGV genome responsible for a shorter movement protein has been found. A phylogenetic study based on this genomic region has shown a high variability among Spanish isolates and points to a different evolutionary origin of this new polymorphism. The methodology here developed opens new possibilities for basic and epidemiological studies as well as for the establishment of efficient control strategies.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b79:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526418000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Félix Morán, Antonio Olmos, Leonidas Lotos, Lukáš Predajňa, Nikolaos Katis, Miroslav Glasa, Varvara Maliogka, Ana B.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is known to provide neuroprotective effect in the central nervous system. However, the detailed mechanism remains far more elusive. This study was designed to investigate the relevant mechanisms of DEX&apos;s neuroprotective effect. Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were injected with dexmedetomidine and/or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally, and inflammatory cytokines in serum and in the hippocampus were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NF-κB in the brain tissue extracts was analyzed with western-blot. Then, we investigated whether NF-κB inhibitor prevents the elevation of inflammatory cytokines in rats injected with LPS. Our results indicated that compared with the control group, the rats exposed to LPS showed significant cognitive dysfunction. When compared to controls, the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the serum and hippocampus homogenate were increased in rats treated with LPS. DEX pretreatment inhibited the rats&apos; TNF-α, IL-6 and NF-κB levels induced by LPS. In response to LPS, PDTC pretreatment restrains the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6). Rats treated with PDTC and DEX alongside LPS exhibited less TNF-α and IL-6 than the LPS treated group. In combination, PDTC and DEX showed addictive effects. Our data suggest that DEX exerts a neuroprotective effect through NF-κB in part after LPS-induced cognitive dysfunction.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3aed:5785ab88</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525381200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaobao Zhang, Fang Yan, Jiying Feng, Haitao Qian, Zhi Cheng, Qianqian Yang, Yong Wu, Zhibin Zhao, Aimin Li, Hang Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

Spatially explicit modelling allows to estimate population abundance and predict species’ distribution in relation to environmental factors. Abiotic factors are the main determinants of a herbivore´s response to environmental heterogeneity on large spatiotemporal scales. We assessed the influence of elevation, geographic location and distance to the coast on the seasonal abundance and distribution of guanaco (&lt;i&gt;Lama guanicoe&lt;/i&gt;) in central Tierra del Fuego, by means of spatially explicit modelling. The estimated abundance was 23,690 individuals for the non-breeding season and 33,928 individuals for the breeding season. The factors influencing distribution and abundance revealed to be the elevation for the non-breeding season, and the distance to the coast and geographic location for the breeding season. The southwest of the study area presented seasonal abundance variation and the southeast and northeast presented high abundance during both seasons. The elevation would be the driving factor of guanaco distribution, as individuals move to lower areas during the non-breeding season and ascend to high areas during the breeding season. Our results confirm that part of the guanaco population performs seasonal migratory movements and that the main valleys present important wintering habitats for guanacos as well as up-hill zones during summer. This type of study would help to avoid problems of scale mismatch and achieve better results in management actions and is an example of how to assess important seasonal habitats from evaluations of abundance and distribution patterns.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676123d:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526936400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Celina E.

The rise of ontology-based data representation in biology has also led to the development of several semantic similarity metrics that use different statistics to estimate similarity. Although semantic similarity has become a crucial computational tool in several applications, there has not been a formal evaluation of the statistical sensitivity of these metrics and their ability to recognize similarity between distantly related biological objects. Here, we present a statistical sensitivity comparison of five semantic similarity metrics (Jaccard, Resnik, Lin, Jiang &amp;amp; Conrath, and Hybrid Relative Specificity Similarity) representing three different kinds of metrics (Edge based, Node based, and Hybrid) and explore key parameter choices that can impact sensitivity. Furthermore, we compare four methods of aggregating individual annotation similarities to estimate similarity between two biological objects - All Pairs, Best Pairs, Best Pairs Symmetric, and Groupwise. To evaluate sensitivity in a controlled fashion, we explore two different models for simulating data with varying levels of similarity and compare to the noise distribution using resampling. Source data are derived from the Phenoscape Knowledgebase of evolutionary phenotypes. Our results indicate that the choice of similarity metric along with different parameter choices can substantially affect sensitivity. Among the five metrics evaluated, we find that Resnik similarity shows the greatest sensitivity to weak semantic similarity. Among the ways to combine pairwise statistics, the Groupwise approach provides the greatest discrimination among values above the sensitivity threshold, while the Best Pairs statistic can be parametrically tuned to provide the highest sensitivity. Our findings serve as a guideline for an appropriate choice and parameterization of semantic similarity metrics, and point to the need for improved reporting of the statistical significance of semantic similarity matches in cases where weak similarity is of interest.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163884a5d0d:6bbd3ed:3dd877af</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526972400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Semantic similarity has been used for comparing genes, proteins, phenotypes, diseases, etc. for various biological applications.

The human brain has the impressive capacity to adapt how it processes information to high-level goals. While it is known that these cognitive control skills are malleable and can be improved through training, the underlying plasticity mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we develop and evaluate a model of how people learn when to exert cognitive control, which controlled process to use, and how much effort to exert. We derive this model from a general theory according to which the function of cognitive control is to select and configure neural pathways so as to make optimal use of finite time and limited computational resources. The central idea of our Learned Value of Control model is that people use reinforcement learning to predict the value of candidate control signals of different types and intensities based on stimulus features. This model correctly predicts the learning and transfer effects underlying the adaptive control-demanding behavior observed in an experiment on visual attention and four experiments on interference control in Stroop and Flanker paradigms. Moreover, our model explained these findings significantly better than an associative learning model and a Win-Stay Lose-Shift model. Our findings elucidate how learning and experience might shape people’s ability and propensity to adaptively control their minds and behavior. We conclude by predicting under which circumstances these learning mechanisms might lead to self-control failure.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Aj4DbuvGLfQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162fdf4e8f7:3b1d0b:a96d255</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524690000000</published><recrawled>1524688928428</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Falk Lieder, Amitai Shenhav, Sebastian Musslick, Thomas L.

NAC proteins are a family of transcription factors which have a variety of important regulatory roles in plants. They present a very well conserved group of NAC subdomains in the N-terminal region and a highly variable domain at the C-terminus. Currently, knowledge concerning NAC family in the strawberry plant remains very limited. In this work, we analyzed the NAC family of &lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;, and a total of 112 NAC proteins were identified after we curated the annotations from the version 4.0.a1 genome. They were placed into the ligation groups (pseudo-chromosomes) and described its physicochemical and genetic features. A microarray transcriptomic analysis showed six of them expressed during the development and ripening of the &lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; x &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit. Their expression patterns were studied in fruit (receptacle and achenes) in different stages of development and in vegetative tissues. Also, the expression level under different hormonal treatments (auxins, ABA) and drought stress was investigated. In addition, they were clustered with other NAC transcription factor with known function related to growth and development, senescence, fruit ripening, stress response, and secondary cell wall and vascular development. Our results indicate that these six strawberry NAC proteins could play different important regulatory roles in the process of development and ripening of the fruit, providing the basis for further functional studies and the selection for NAC candidates suitable for biotechnological applications.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af4:5785ab88</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525381200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Enriqueta Moyano, Félix J.

Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) producing carbapenemases are increasing at an alarming speed. Rapid confirmation of carbapenemase type will be an important diagnostic step in clinical microbiology laboratories not only to reduce the risk of transmissions but also for optimising antibiotic therapy in the future. We compared diagnostic reliability of two commercially available molecular assays (Check-Direct CPE vs. AID line probe assay) for detection and typing of carbapenemase genes in 80 well-characterized isolates of MDR-GNB. Respective strains were isolated in various clinical specimens at our clinical microbiology laboratory. The reference standard included confirmation of carbapenemase-production at the molecular level at the German National Reference Laboratory for Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany). 53 &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and 27 members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex were used in this study. The tested assays appeared highly reliable to confirm carbapenemase-producing &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; (CPE) with respective sensitivities of 97.7%, but are currently unsuitable for analysis of members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex. Both assays are easy to perform and rapid tools for confirmation and typing of the most common carbapenemase genes in &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;.

Rapid confirmation of carbapenemase type will be an important diagnostic step in clinical microbiology laboratories not only to reduce the risk of transmissions but also for optimising antibiotic therapy in the future. We compared diagnostic reliability of two commercially available molecular assays (Check-Direct CPE vs. AID line probe assay) for detection and typing of carbapenemase genes in 80 well-characterized isolates of MDR-GNB. Respective strains were isolated in various clinical specimens at our clinical microbiology laboratory. The reference standard included confirmation of carbapenemase-production at the molecular level at the German National Reference Laboratory for Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany). 53 &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and 27 members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex were used in this study. The tested assays appeared highly reliable to confirm carbapenemase-producing &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; (CPE) with respective sensitivities of 97.7%, but are currently unsuitable for analysis of members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex. Both assays are easy to perform and rapid tools for confirmation and typing of the most common carbapenemase genes in &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;. Implementation should be possible for any clinical microbiology laboratory with Check-Direct CPE being easier to handle and having less technological requirements.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197839</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>9ec8f397</fingerprint><title>Comparison of two commercial carbapenemase gene confirmatory assays in multiresistant &amp;lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&amp;lt;/i&gt;-complex</title><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><updated>1526936400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Stephan Rösner</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197839</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197839</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197839</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Shepherd, Geoff K.

Background &lt;p&gt;Paritaprevir inhibits organic anion–transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3, which transport bilirubin. Hyperbilirubinemia is an adverse event reported during hepatitis C treatment. Gadoxetic acid is also transported by OATP1B1/1B3. We evaluated whether the enhancement effect in gadoxetic acid–enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging could predict the plasma concentration of paritaprevir and might anticipate the development of hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective study evaluated 27 patients with hepatitis C who underwent gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging prior to treatment with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir. The contrast enhancement index (CEI), a measure of liver enhancement during the hepatobiliary phase, was assessed. Plasma trough concentrations, and concentrations at 2, 4, and 6 h after dosing were determined 7 d after the start of treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven patients (26%) developed hyperbilirubinemia (≥ 1.6 mg/dl). Paritaprevir trough concentration (C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt;) was significantly higher in patients with hyperbilirubinemia than in those without (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022). We found an inverse relationship between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; (r = 0.612, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), while there was not a significantly weak inverse relationship between AUC&lt;sub&gt;0–6 h&lt;/sub&gt; and CEI (r = −0.338, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.085). The partial correlation coefficient between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; was −0.425 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.034), while excluding the effects of albumin and the FIB-4 index. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the CEI was relatively accurate in predicting hyperbilirubinemia, with area under the ROC of 0.882. Multivariate analysis showed that the CEI &amp;lt; 1.61 was the only independent predictor related to the development of hyperbilirubinemia, with an odds ratio of 9.08 (95% confidence interval 1.05–78.86, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hepatic enhancement with gadoxetic acid was independently related to paritaprevir concentration and was an independent pretreatment factor in predicting hyperbilirubinemia. Gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging can therefore be useful in determining the risk of paritaprevir-induced hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e62:fc1f8953</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525122000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hironao Okubo, Hitoshi Ando, Yushi Sorin, Eisuke Nakadera, Hiroo Fukada, Junichi Morishige, Akihisa Miyazaki, Kenichi Ikejima&lt;/p&gt;

MiRNA molecules are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the brain function. Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of Aβ in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ, and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer).

MiRNA molecules are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the brain function. Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of Aβ in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ, and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196929</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>dfde1d51</fingerprint><title>Defensive effect of microRNA-200b/c against amyloid-beta peptide-induced toxicity in Alzheimer&apos;s disease models</title><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Sayuri Higaki</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196929</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196929</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196929</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Claudia Agabiti-Rosei, Valentina Trapletti, Silvia Piantoni, Paolo Airò, Angela Tincani, Carolina De Ciuceis, Claudia Rossini, Francesco Mittempergher, Amin Titi, Nazario Portolani, Stefano Caletti, Maria Antonietta Coschignano, Enzo Porteri, Guido A.

Objective &lt;p&gt;It has been previously demonstrated that T lymphocytes may be involved in the development of hypertension and microvascular remodeling, and that circulating T effector lymphocytes may be increased in hypertension.

Several studies have reported regulatory effects of estrogens on fear conditioning in female rodents. However, these studies used different doses, durations, and/or administration methods, and reported inconsistent results. To clarify the effect of estrogen on fear conditioning, we investigated the effects of different doses and durations of estradiol administration on freezing behavior during contextual fear conditioning in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In Experiment 1, OVX ICR mice received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of either oil vehicle (control, 0.1 ml sesame oil) or varied doses (0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, or 50 μg/0.1 ml) of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB). Fear conditioning was conducted two days post-EB treatment, and the mice were tested for the learned fear response the following day. In Experiment 2, OVX female mice received an s.c. implantation of a Silastic capsule (I.D. 1.98 × 20.0 mm) containing either vehicle or varied doses (0.05 μg/0.1 ml, 0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, 50 μg/0.1 ml) of EB. Two weeks after implantation, fear conditioning was conducted. During the tests conducted 24 h after conditioning, the high dose EB group showed longer freezing times in both experiments, and lower locomotor activity compared to the control or lower dose groups. In Experiment 3, serum estradiol concentrations of the mice that were treated like those in Experiment 2, were measured; the serum levels of estradiol increased linearly according to the dose of EB administered. The results suggest that mice treated with a high dose of EB exhibit enhanced fear learning, regardless of treatment duration. As a woman’s vulnerability to emotional disorders increases in the peripregnancy period, during which estrogen levels are high, the results from the high-dose EB groups may be important for understanding the hormonal mechanisms involved in these disorders.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8e:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526418000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yui K.

Understanding protein-RNA binding may thus provide important insights to the functionality and dynamics of many cellular processes. This has sparked substantial interest in exploring protein-RNA binding experimentally, and predicting it computationally. The key computational challenge is to efficiently and accurately infer RNA-binding models that will enable prediction of novel protein-RNA interactions to additional transcripts of interest. Results: We developed DLPRB, a new deep neural network (DNN) approach for learning protein-RNA binding preferences and predicting novel interactions. We present two different network architectures: a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The novelty of our network hinges upon two key aspects: (i) the joint analysis of both RNA sequence and structure, which is represented as a probability vector of different RNA structural contexts; (ii) novel features in the architecture of the networks, such as the application of RNNs to RNA-binding prediction, and the combination of hundreds of variable-length filters in the CNN. Our results in inferring accurate RNA-binding models from high-throughput in vitro data exhibit substantial improvements, compared to all previous approaches for protein-RNA binding prediction (both DNN and non-DNN based). A highly significant improvement is achieved for in vitro binding prediction, and a more modest, yet statistically significant, improvement for in vivo binding prediction. When incorporating experimentally-measured RNA structure compared to predicted one, the improvement on in vivo data increases. By visualizing the binding specificities, we can gain novel biological insights underlying the mechanism of protein RNA-binding.

Background &lt;p&gt;Availability of correct and adequate information about medicines is an important aspect in ensuring rational use of medicines and hence facilitating safety and expected efficacy of medicines during therapy. Package inserts have proven to be a good source of information to the prescribers and patients whereby they have been useful in highlighting important information pertaining proper use and handling of the medicines. The present study was aimed at establishing the extent to which package inserts of medicines circulating on the markets of the East African Community (EAC) Partner States conform to medicines information requirements as established in the harmonized guidelines as well as national guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 99 package inserts from six (6) types of medicines namely Albendazole, Artemether/Lumefantrine (ALu), Ciprofloxacin, Paracetamol, Amoxicillin and Metronidazole were purposefully collected from three EAC Partner States: Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The medicines were selected based on their indications as first line treatments, high rates of utilization within the medicines supply system and their positions in treatment of diseases of public importance across EAC Partner States. The inserts were evaluated on the availability of information regarding fifteen (15) parameters as extracted from the EAC harmonized guidelines for registration of medicines. Moreover, comparisons were made between the percentage conformity of the branded versus generic products, markets from which the samples were collected, origin of the manufacturer and type of medicine.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Majority (93.9–100%) of the medicines’ package inserts highly conformed to the inclusion of the information regarding the description and composition of the medications, indications, dosage and methods of administration, warnings and precautions, contraindications and storage conditions. However, the information on handling and disposal, container package description, excipients used, clinical pharmacology of the medicines, and directions regarding overdose ranked the least in conformance with conformity ranging from 13.1–52.5%.The parameter with the lowest observed percentage conformity among the branded products scored 50% as compared to 10.8% among the generic products. Moreover, there was no significant difference (P&amp;lt;0.05) in the percentage conformity of the package inserts collected from each of the three Partner States as compared to the average from studied medicines. A generally good conformity was observed among medicines manufactured by European based manufacturers as compared to those based in Asia and EAC Partner States. In addition, PIs of Albendazole, Ciprofloxacin, Amoxicillin and Artemether/Lumefantrine did show overall high conformity across most of the product information requirements.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study revealed the existence of a significant number of medicinal products circulating on the markets of EAC Partner States without necessary compliance with all product information requirements. We therefore recommend that NMRAs ensure thorough pre-market assessment of product information as well as strengthening their post marketing surveillance to ensure that medicines circulating on the market comply to medicines information requirements at all times. Emphasis should also be given to manufacturers on the importance of inclusion of appropriate and adequate product information for the safety of patients, including advocating for inclusion of patient-friendly and easy to understand medicines information.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709405a:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1527022800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hiiti B.

Goat breeding has become an important sector in Eastern Europe, with Romania and Hungary being among the major producer countries. Given the limited number of research done up-to-date concerning genetic studies of indigenous goat breeds reared in Romania and Hungary, the current preliminary study aimed to analyze the variability of genes related to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism by using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP™). We studied 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonging to 19 genes in indigenous breeds from both countries, namely Banat’s White (n = 36), Carpatina (n = 35) from Romania and Hungarian Milking (n = 79) and identified 16 polymorphic SNPs among 10 genes (&lt;i&gt;PTX3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLEC4E&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNFSF13&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TLR3&lt;/i&gt;) in 150 animals. Furthermore, the diversity of the studied breeds was investigated. The PIC values ranged from 0.042 to 0.691. The mean values of observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.235 and 0.246 respectively. The highest observed heterozygosity was obtained for &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T in Banat’s White (0.464), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T in Carpatina (0.577) and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G in Hungarian Milking (0.588). Pairwise F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values between the Romanian breeds and Romanian and Hungarian breeds were small (0.009 and 0.015), indicating the close relationship among the studied goat populations. From all the polymorphic SNPs identified, the Hungarian Milking breed showed the highest proportion of polymorphisms (100%), whereas the Carpatina breed had the lowest percentage (87.5%). The highest value of MAF was obtained for &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G (0.46), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T (0.47), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10344025C&gt;T (0.45), and &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T (0.42). The 16 polymorphic SNPs identified in a panel of 150 unrelated individuals belonging to three Romanian and Hungarian indigenous goat breeds could be used in future genomic based breeding schemes as markers for genetic resistance to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism in goat breeds found in Eastern and Central Europe.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bede:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525899600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Elena Ilie, Szilvia Kusza, Maria Sauer, Dinu Gavojdian&lt;/p&gt;

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was carried out on the up-regulated genes which were statistically significant and corresponded with the NCBI generated annotations. Protein-Protein Interaction Network for these genes was constructed. GSEA revealed 5 transcription factors, 5 microRNAs and 3 pathways significantly associated with them.

These 6 proteins may open a new window of opportunity for the discovery/design of new drugs for mitigating the damage caused by myocardial infarction.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/25/308544</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>cce0fd94</fingerprint><title>Identification of Key Proteins Associated with Myocardial Infarction using Bioinformatics and Systems Biology [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1524697542120</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Ahammad, I.</name></author><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308544v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308544v1?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308544v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phenotypic diversification by enhanced genome restructuring after induction of multiple DNA double-strand breaks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phenotypic diversification by enhanced genome restructuring after induction of multiple DNA double-strand breaks, Published online: 18 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04256-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04256-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;DNA double-strand break (DSB) leads to genome rearrangements with various genetic and phenotypic effects.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In addition to conventional therapies, several new strategies have been proposed for modulating autoimmune diseases, including the adoptive transfer of immunological cells. In this context, dendritic cells (DCs) appear to be one of the most promising treatments for autoimmune disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of adoptive transfer of DCs obtained from both naïve and ovalbumin (OVA)-tolerant mice on the severity of TNBS induced colitis and analyze the eventual protective mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;To induce oral tolerance, BALB/c mice were fed 4mg/mL OVA solution for seven consecutive days. Spleen DCs were isolated from tolerant (tDC) and naïve (nDC) mice, and then adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice. Three days later, colitis was induced in DC treated mice by intrarectal instillation of 100μg2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 50% ethanol. Control subjects received only intrarectal instillation of either TNBS solution or a vehicle. Five days later, mice from all groups were euthanized and examined for physiological and immunological parameters. Regarding the phenotype, we observed that the frequencies of CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHC II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were significantly lower in DCs isolated from tolerant mice than in those from naive mice. However, pretreatment with both types of DCs was able to significantly reduce clinical signs of colitis such as diarrhea, rectal prolapse, bleeding, and cachexia, although only treatment with tDCs was able to prevent weight loss from instillation of TNBS. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; proliferation of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs was significantly lower than that observed in splenic cell cultures of naïve mice. Although no significant difference was observed in the frequencies of Treg cells in the experimental groups, the frequency of Th17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;cellsand the secretion of IL-17 were more reduced in the cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs. The levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ were lower in supernatants of cells from mice treated with nDCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results allow us to conclude that the adoptive transfer of cells expressing CD11c is able to reduce the clinical and immunological signs of drug-induced colitis. Adoptive transfer of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DC isolated from both naive and tolerant mice altered the proliferative and T cell responses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously published data showing the protective effects of DCs from naïve or tolerant mice in the treatment of colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475060:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525813200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lisiery N.

Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) constitutes one of the most important food fish in Japan; accordingly, genome sequencing and linkage mapping have been conducted for the purpose of artificial cultivation. In the next stage, integration of genomic sequences within linkage groups (LG) is required to construct higher-resolution genetic markers for quantitative trait loci mapping and selective breeding of beneficial traits in farming. In order to identify LG1-linked scaffolds from the draft genome assembly (323,776 scaffolds) reported previously, we attempted to isolate chromosomes corresponding to LG1 by flow sorting and subsequent analyses. Initially, single chromosomes were randomly collected by chromosome sorting and subjected to whole-genome amplification (WGA). A total of 60 WGA samples were screened by PCR with primers for a known LG1-linked scaffold, and five positive WGA samples were sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Following reference mapping analysis of the NGS reads, four of the five WGA samples were found to be enriched by LG1-linked sequences. These samples were cytogenetically assigned to chromosome 5 by fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization. Using blastn searches with 82,081 contigs constructed from the NGS reads of the four WGA samples as queries, 2323 scaffolds were identified as putative LG1-linked scaffolds from the draft genome assembly. The total length of the putative LG1-linked scaffolds was 99.0 Mb, comparable to the estimated DNA amounts of chromosome 5 (91.1 Mb). These results suggest that the methodology developed herein is applicable to isolate specific chromosome DNAs and integrate unanchored scaffold sequences onto a particular LG and chromosome even in teleost fishes, in which isolation of specific chromosomes by flow sorting is generally difficult owing to similar morphologies, sizes, and GC-contents among chromosomes in the genome. The putative LG1-linked scaffolds of Japanese eel contain a total of 6833 short tandem repeats which will be available for higher-resolution linkage mapping.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475065:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525813200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kazumi Matsubara, Yuki Iwasaki, Issei Nishiki, Kazuharu Nomura, Atushi Fujiwara&lt;/p&gt;

Secreted Nano-luciferase (secNluc) is a newly engineered secreted luciferase that possesses advantages of high structural stability, long half-life, and glow-type kinetics together with high light emission intensity, and thus would become one of the most valuable tools for bioluminescence assays. However, like other secreted luciferases, secNluc has to mix with the components in the conditioned medium surrounding test cells, or in the biological samples such as blood or urine after being secreted. These components may interfere with secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions and thus limit the application of the secNluc reporter system. In this study, we first examined the effects of three factors, pH, serum and residual reagents, on secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions, finding that these factors could interfere with bioluminescence reactions and result in background signal. To resolve these problems, we applied a simple affinity purification strategy in which secNluc was fused with a FLAG-tag, and anti-FLAG magnetic beads were used to catch and transfer the fusion protein to PBST, an optimal buffer for secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions that was identified in this study. The results indicated that this strategy could not only negate the interferences from serum or residual reagents and enhance the stability of light emission but also greatly increase signal intensity through enzyme enrichment. This strategy may contribute to biomedical studies that utilize secNluc and other secreted luciferases, especially those requiring superior sensitivity, low background noise and high reproducibility.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a180:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525294800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by JingZhe Li, ZhiLan Guo, Takashi Sato, Bo Yuan, YanYan Ma, Dan Qian, JuYing Zhong, MengMeng Jin, Peng Huang, LuYang Che, Yi Wang, Yan Lei, ChangZhen Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive nucleotide sequences that make up a large portion of eukaryotic genomes. They can move and duplicate within a genome, increasing genome size and contributing to genetic diversity within and across species. Accurate identification and classification of TEs present in a genome is an important step towards understanding their effects on genes and their role in genome evolution. We introduce TE-Learner, a framework based on machine learning that automatically identifies TEs in a given genome and assigns a classification to them. We present an implementation of our framework towards LTR retrotransposons, a particular type of TEs characterized by having long terminal repeats (LTRs) at their boundaries. We evaluate the predictive performance of our framework on the well-annotated genomes of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and we compare our results for three LTR retrotransposon superfamilies with the results of three widely used methods for TE identification or classification: RepeatMasker, Censor and LtrDigest. In contrast to these methods, TE-Learner is the first to incorporate machine learning techniques, outperforming these methods in terms of predictive performance, while able to learn models and make predictions efficiently. Moreover, we show that our method was able to identify TEs that none of the above method could find, and we investigated TE-Learner’s predictions which did not correspond to an official annotation. It turns out that many of these predictions are in fact strongly homologous to a known TE.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WmOp0oT-h9c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162f3a6e287:392b8:a077e55f</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524517200000</published><recrawled>1524516127247</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Leander Schietgat, Celine Vens, Ricardo Cerri, Carlos N.

Interleukin 17 (IL-17)–producing γδ T cells (γδ17 T cells) have been recently found to promote tumor growth and metastasis formation. How such γδ17 T-cell responses may be regulated in the tumor microenvironment remains, however, largely unknown. Here, we report that tumor-associated neutrophils can display an overt antitumor role by strongly suppressing γδ17 T cells. Tumor-associated neutrophils inhibited the proliferation of murine CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells via induction of oxidative stress, thereby preventing them from constituting the major source of pro-tumoral IL-17 in the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we found that low expression of the antioxidant glutathione in CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells renders them particularly susceptible to neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistently, superoxide deficiency, or the administration of a glutathione precursor, rescued CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T-cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, human Vδ1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ T cells, which contain most γδ17 T cells found in cancer patients, also displayed low glutathione levels and were potently inhibited by ROS. This work thus identifies an unanticipated, immunosuppressive yet antitumoral, neutrophil/ROS/γδ17 T-cell axis in the tumor microenvironment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dvsUoCba6KA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f4:f3bf0074</id><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526072400000</published><recrawled>1526060763996</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Mensurado, Margarida Rei, Telma Lança, Marianna Ioannou, Natacha Gonçalves-Sousa, Hiroshi Kubo, Marie Malissen, Venizelos Papayannopoulos, Karine Serre, Bruno Silva-Santos&lt;/p&gt;

This work thus identifies an unanticipated, immunosuppressive yet antitumoral, neutrophil/ROS/γδ17 T-cell axis in the tumor microenvironment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dvsUoCba6KA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><engagement>1</engagement><fingerprint>d05a552a</fingerprint><author><name>Sofia Mensurado</name></author><crawled>1526060694416</crawled><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Tumor-associated neutrophils suppress pro-tumoral IL-17+ γδ T cells through induction of oxidative stress</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004990</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004990</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004990</originId><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/dvsUoCba6KA/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Zhang, Mingna Chen, Youming Zhang, Wei Chen, Lihua Zhang, Lv Chen&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to generate an ultrasonic nanobubble (NB)-mediated purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)/fludarabine suicide gene system for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;NBs were prepared from a mixture the phospholipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DPPA), perfluoropropane gas and other materials using the high shear dispersion method. NBs treated with ultrasound irradiation functioned as a gene-transfer system, and a self-constructed suicide gene expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP, treated with fludarabine functioned as a therapeutic gene. This system was used to determine the cytotoxic effects of PNP/fludarabine on HepG2 cells and SMMC7721 cells.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1. NBs with a small diameter (208–416 nm) and at a high concentration and fine homogeneity were prepared under the optimal method. 2. The pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP plasmid was efficiently transfected into HCC cells using ultrasonic NBs. 3. At 0.75μg/ml fludarabine, PNP/fludarabine showed marked cytotoxic effects toward HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. PNP/fludarabine achieved the same effect against both SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells but at a lower concentration of fludarabine for the latter. 4. Bystander effects: a 10–20% decrease in the cell survival rate was observed when only 5–10% of transfected cells were PNP positive.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;NBs constitute a non-toxic, stable and effective gene-delivery platform. The PNP/fludarabine suicide gene system inhibited the growth of HCC cells, induced HCC cell apoptosis, and caused a notable bystander effect at a low fludarabine concentration.

Cutting-edge high-dimensional analysis methods are successful in characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but they suffer from the &apos;curse of dimensionality&apos; and non-standardized outputs. Results: Here we introduce RefCell, a multi-dimensional analysis pipeline for image-based HTS that focuses on reproducible capturing of cells with typical features of control cell state (i.e., typical cells), and use these cells as a reference for perturbed cell states. RefCell quantitatively assesses the heterogeneous deviations from the typical behavior for each analyzed perturbation/ sample. Conclusions: We apply RefCell to the analysis of data from a high-throughput imaging screen of a library of 320 ubiquitin protein targeted siRNAs selected to gain insights into the mechanisms of premature aging (progeria).

Cutting-edge high-dimensional analysis methods are successful in characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but they suffer from the &apos;curse of dimensionality&apos; and non-standardized outputs. Results: Here we introduce RefCell, a multi-dimensional analysis pipeline for image-based HTS that focuses on reproducible capturing of cells with typical features of control cell state (i.e., typical cells), and use these cells as a reference for perturbed cell states. RefCell quantitatively assesses the heterogeneous deviations from the typical behavior for each analyzed perturbation/ sample. Conclusions: We apply RefCell to the analysis of data from a high-throughput imaging screen of a library of 320 ubiquitin protein targeted siRNAs selected to gain insights into the mechanisms of premature aging (progeria). We compare RefCell results to a clustering based single cell analysis methods as well as conventional average based results. RefCell is able to identify similar results as the other two methods. In addition, RefCell is able to identify perturbations that deviate cells far from the control states.

Background &lt;p&gt;We investigated the effects of multiple-modality exercise with additional mind-motor training on cognition in community-dwelling older adults with subjective cognitive complaints.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Participants (n = 127, mean age 67.5 [7.3] years, 71% women) were randomized to receive 45 minutes of multiple-modality exercise with additional 15 minutes of either mind-motor training (M4, n = 63) or control (balance, range of motion and breathing exercises [M2, n = 64]). In total, both groups exercised 60 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 24 weeks. Standardized global cognitive functioning (GCF), concentration, reasoning, planning, and memory were assessed at 24 weeks and after a 28-week no-contact follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences in the study primary outcomes.

Primary brain microvessels (BrMV) maintain the cellular characters and molecular signatures as displayed in vivo, and serve as a vital tool for biomedical research of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the development/optimization of brain drug delivery. The variations of relative purities or cellular composition among different BrMV samples may have significant consequences in data interpretation and research outcome, especially for experiments with high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable reference gene (RG) for accurate normalization of real-time RT-qPCR analysis, and determine the proper marker genes (MG) for relative purity assessment in BrMV samples. Out of five housekeeping genes, β-actin was selected as the most suitable RG that was validated by quantifying mRNA levels of alpha-L-iduronidase in BrMV isolated from mice with one or two expressing alleles. Four marker genes highly/selectively expressed in BBB-forming capillary endothelial cells were evaluated by RT-qPCR for purity assessment, resulting in &lt;i&gt;Cldn&lt;/i&gt;5 and &lt;i&gt;Pecam1&lt;/i&gt; as most suitable MGs that were further confirmed by immunofluorescent analysis of cellular components. &lt;i&gt;Plvap&lt;/i&gt; proved to be an indicator gene for the presence of fenestrated vessels in BrMV samples.

This study aimed to establish a new methodology for upgrading biomass quality using low-temperature (below 100 °C) oxidation to achieve simultaneous drying and decomposition. Sterilized manure (63% wet basis) was heated at 90 °C for 49 days under an oxidative environment. The obtained solid and moisture reduction curves indicated that drying and decomposition proceeded simultaneously. The biomass was decomposed by oxidation with the release of water, carbon dioxide, and volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid. The oxidation process stopped when the biomass was dehydrated, indicating that the water originally present in the biomass governed the process.

This study aimed to establish a new methodology for upgrading biomass quality using low-temperature (below 100 °C) oxidation to achieve simultaneous drying and decomposition. Sterilized manure (63% wet basis) was heated at 90 °C for 49 days under an oxidative environment. The obtained solid and moisture reduction curves indicated that drying and decomposition proceeded simultaneously. The biomass was decomposed by oxidation with the release of water, carbon dioxide, and volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid. The oxidation process stopped when the biomass was dehydrated, indicating that the water originally present in the biomass governed the process. Elemental and calorific analyses revealed no remarkable increase in carbon content or increased heating value, and a slight decrease in oxygen content. Although the severity of the process was insufficient to produce an optimum solid fuel due to the low temperature used, the process would enable the stabilization of waste biomass with low energy consumption such as using waste heat.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196249</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>17c8124c</fingerprint><title>A new approach to stabilize waste biomass for valorization using an oxidative process at 90 °C</title><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><updated>1524517200000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Takanori Itoh</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196249</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196249</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196249</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>Preprocessing of functional MRI (fMRI) involves numerous steps to clean and standardize data before statistical analysis.

Background &lt;p&gt;We sought to develop a novel risk assessment tool to predict the clinical outcomes after heat-related illness.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Prospective, multicenter observational study. Patients who transferred to emergency hospitals in Japan with heat-related illness were registered. The sample was divided into two parts: 60% to construct the score and 40% to validate it. A binary logistic regression model was used to predict hospital admission as a primary outcome. The resulting model was transformed into a scoring system.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 3,001 eligible patients were analyzed. There was no difference in variables between development and validation cohorts. Based on the result of a logistic regression model in the development phase (n = 1,805), the J-ERATO score was defined as the sum of the six binary components in the prehospital setting (respiratory rate≥22 /min, Glasgow coma scale&amp;lt;15, systolic blood pressure≤100 mmHg, heart rate≥100 bpm, body temperature≥38°C, and age≥65 y), for a total score ranging from 0 to 6. In the validation phase (n = 1,196), the score had excellent discrimination (C-statistic 0.84; 95% CI 0.79–0.89, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and calibration (P&gt;0.2 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The observed proportion of hospital admission increased with increasing J-ERATO score (score = 0, 5.0%; score = 1, 15.0%; score = 2, 24.6%; score = 3, 38.6%; score = 4, 68.0%; score = 5, 85.2%; score = 6, 96.4%). Multivariate analyses showed that the J-ERATO score was an independent positive predictor of hospital admission (adjusted OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.06–2.87; P&amp;lt;0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (3.73; 2.95–4.72; P&amp;lt;0.001) and in-hospital mortality (1.65; 1.18–2.32; P = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The J-ERATO score is simply assessed and can facilitate the identification of patients with higher risk of heat-related hospitalization.

Background and objective &lt;p&gt;Potential hepatoxicity is an important clinical concern when administering immunosuppressive therapies to patients infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV). Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF) increase the likelihood of hepatitis consequent to HBV reactivation, but reported risks and outcomes vary. We determined the risks of liver enzyme elevation in anti-rheumatic drug users from an HBV-endemic region with differing HBV serostatus.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We established retrospective cohorts with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis who: 1) received anti-TNF agents from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2013; 2) received care from 1 June 2011 to 30 June 2013 but only ever used conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Background and objective &lt;p&gt;Potential hepatoxicity is an important clinical concern when administering immunosuppressive therapies to patients infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV). Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF) increase the likelihood of hepatitis consequent to HBV reactivation, but reported risks and outcomes vary. We determined the risks of liver enzyme elevation in anti-rheumatic drug users from an HBV-endemic region with differing HBV serostatus.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We established retrospective cohorts with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis who: 1) received anti-TNF agents from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2013; 2) received care from 1 June 2011 to 30 June 2013 but only ever used conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Serology results defined three subgroups: HBV surface antigen positive (HBsAg+), HBsAg negative/HBV core antibody positive (HBsAg−/HBcAb+), or uninfected. We compared incidences of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) exceeding twice the upper reference limit between HBV serostatus subgroups in each treatment cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 783 patients treated with anti-TNF (n = 472) or DMARDs only (n = 311), HBsAg−/HBcAb+ anti-TNF users had incidence of ALT elevation commensurate with uninfected counterparts (6.1 vs. 6.0/100 person-years), compared to 19.6/100 person-years in HBsAg+ patients (standardized rate ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.3–8.2); none effected had severe or fatal hepatitis and ALT levels in all HBsAg−/HBcAb+ patients remained stable, mostly normalizing spontaneously, or after moderating treatment.

Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) and mouse models of hair graying serve as useful systems to uncover mechanisms involved in stem cell self-renewal and the maintenance of regenerating tissues. Interested in assessing genetic variants that influence McSC maintenance, we found previously that heterozygosity for the melanogenesis associated transcription factor, &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt;, exacerbates McSC differentiation and hair graying in mice that are predisposed for this phenotype. Based on transcriptome and molecular analyses of &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;mi-vga9/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, we report a novel role for MITF in the regulation of systemic innate immune gene expression. We also demonstrate that the viral mimic poly(I:C) is sufficient to expose genetic susceptibility to hair graying. These observations point to a critical suppressor of innate immunity, the consequences of innate immune dysregulation on pigmentation, both of which may have implications in the autoimmune, depigmenting disease, vitiligo.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/N1nbD-4XsNQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163272479f8:1444:a96d255</id><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525381200000</published><recrawled>1525375448507</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Melissa L.

Aims &lt;p&gt;Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), secreted primarily by atrial cardiomyocytes, decreases blood pressure by raising cyclic 3’,5’-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels and inducing vasorelaxation, natriuresis, and diuresis. Raising the level of ANP has been shown to be an effective treatment for hypertension. To advance the future development of an anti-microRNA (miR) approach to increasing expression of ANP, we investigated the regulation of &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression by two miRs: miR-425 and miR-155. We examined whether miR-425 and miR-155 have an additive effect on the expression and function of ANP.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) were transfected with miR-425, miR-155, or a combination of the two miRs. Two days later, &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression was measured using real time qPCR. Each of the miRs decreased &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression over a wide range of concentrations, with a significant reduction at concentrations as low as 1 nM. The combination of miR-425 and miR-155 reduced &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression to a greater extent than either miR-425 or miR-155 alone. An &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay was developed to study the potential biological significance of the miR-induced decrease in &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression. The cooperative effect of miR-425 and miR-155 on &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression was associated with a significant decrease in cGMP levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that miR-425 and miR-155 regulate &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression in a cooperative manner. Targeting both miRNAs with anti-miRs (possibly at submaximal concentrations) might prove to be a more effective strategy to modulate ANP levels, and thus blood pressure, than targeting either miRNA alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefc6:11c251fd</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524776400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Vandenwijngaert, Clara D.

The red algal subclass Nemaliophycidae includes both marine and freshwater taxa that contribute to more than half of the freshwater species in Rhodophyta. Given that these taxa inhabit diverse habitats, the Nemaliophycidae is a suitable model for studying environmental adaptation. For this purpose, we characterized plastid genomes of two freshwater species, &lt;i&gt;Kumanoa americana&lt;/i&gt; (Batrachospermales) and &lt;i&gt;Thorea hispida&lt;/i&gt; (Thoreales), and one marine species &lt;i&gt;Palmaria palmata&lt;/i&gt; (Palmariales). Comparative genome analysis identified seven genes (&lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;46, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;91, &lt;i&gt;grx&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A) that were different among marine and freshwater species. Among currently available red algal plastid genomes (127), four genes (&lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37) were retained in most of the marine species. Among these, the &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A gene, known for encoding heme oxygenase, had two additional copies (&lt;i&gt;HMOX1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HMOX2&lt;/i&gt;) that were newly discovered and were reported from previously red algal nuclear genomes. Each type of heme oxygenase had a different evolutionary history and special modifications (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., plastid targeting signal peptide). Based on this observation, we suggest that the plastid-encoded &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A contributes to the iron controlling system in iron-deprived conditions. Thus, we highlight that this functional requirement may have prevented gene loss during the long evolutionary history of red algal plastid genomes.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475061:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525813200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chung Hyun Cho, Ji Won Choi, Daryl W.

Elevated temperature induces the heat shock (HS) response, which modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, the immune and inflammatory responses. However, specific mechanisms linking the HS response pathways to major cellular signaling systems are not fully understood. Here we used integrated computational and experimental approaches to quantitatively analyze the crosstalk mechanisms between the HS-response and a master regulator of inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis the Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) system. We found that populations of human osteosarcoma cells, exposed to a clinically relevant 43°C HS had an attenuated NF-κB p65 response to Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) treatment. The degree of inhibition of the NF-κB response depended on the HS exposure time. Mathematical modeling of single cells indicated that individual crosstalk mechanisms differentially encode HS-mediated NF-κB responses while being consistent with the observed population-level responses. In particular “all-or-nothing” encoding mechanisms were involved in the HS-dependent regulation of the IKK activity and IκBα phosphorylation, while others involving transport were “analogue”. In order to discriminate between these mechanisms, we used live-cell imaging of nuclear translocations of the NF-κB p65 subunit. The single cell responses exhibited “all-or-nothing” encoding. While most cells did not respond to TNFα stimulation after a 60 min HS, 27% showed responses similar to those not receiving HS. We further demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the predicted inhibition of IKK activity was consistent with the observed HS-dependent depletion of the IKKα and IKKβ subunits in whole cell lysates. However, a combination of “all-or-nothing” crosstalk mechanisms was required to completely recapitulate the single cell data. We postulate therefore that the heterogeneity of the single cell responses might be explained by the cell-intrinsic variability of HS-modulated IKK signaling. In summary, we show that high temperature modulates NF-κB responses in single cells in a complex and unintuitive manner, which needs to be considered in hyperthermia-based treatment strategies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SmfXbHv2meA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16317a3def5:12714c:ed160cc3</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525122000000</published><recrawled>1525110130225</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Kardyńska, Anna Paszek, Jarosław Śmieja, David Spiller, Wiesława Widłak, Michael R.

Melatonin is a molecule that can enhance the resistance of plants to abiotic stress. It can alleviate the damage of heavy metal ions, and other chemical substances, changes in temperature and humidity, oxidative stress in higher plants, and enhance resistance of plants to abiotic stress. The transformation of N-Acetyl-5-hydroxy tryptamin into melatonin requires the involvement of methyltransferase. In this study, a methyltransferase gene &lt;i&gt;ZjOMT&lt;/i&gt; has been cloned from &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;. The gene was induced by aluminum (Al) stress in the leaves and roots of &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;, and was up-regulated by 20.86- and 31.18-folds, respectively. The expression of ZjOMT in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; increased the content of melatonin by about 8-fold in the recombinant strain compared with that of the empty vector strain. Al resistance test showed that the resistance of recombinant strain BL21-pET32-ZjOMT to Al was significantly higher than that of the empty vector strain BL21-pET32. The survival rate of the recombinant strain expressing ZjOMT was about 100-fold higher than that of the empty vector strain when treated with 0.35 mM Al.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Active recovery is often used by athletes after strenuous exercise or competition but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We observed a time × group interaction effect for VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; (p = 0.013). Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026). No significant effects were observed for all other variables.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Active recovery increased aspects of central, rather than muscle recovery. However, no effect on MVC was seen, implying that even if active recovery speeds up CNS recovery, without affecting the recovery of muscle contractile properties, this doesn´t translate into increases in overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219f:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526331600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Louis-Solal Giboin, Ehsan Amiri, Raphael Bertschinger, Markus Gruber&lt;/p&gt;

Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026). No significant effects were observed for all other variables.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Active recovery increased aspects of central, rather than muscle recovery. However, no effect on MVC was seen, implying that even if active recovery speeds up CNS recovery, without affecting the recovery of muscle contractile properties, this doesn´t translate into increases in overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197339</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>65dc3326</fingerprint><title>Active recovery affects the recovery of the corticospinal system but not of muscle contractile properties</title><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><updated>1526331600000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Louis-Solal Giboin</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197339</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197339</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197339</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gitta Kleijn, Birgit I.

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention combining Life Review Therapy (LRT) and Memory Specificity Training (MST) (LRT-MST) to improve ego-integrity and despair among cancer patients in palliative care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, cancer patients in palliative care were randomized to the intervention group (LRT-MST; n = 55) or waiting-list control group (n = 52). LRT-MST is a 4-session home-based psychological intervention that aims to retrieve specific positive memories, to re-evaluate life events and to reconstruct the story of a patient’s life, including the diagnosis of incurable cancer. Outcome measures were ego-integrity and despair (NEIS), psychological distress, anxiety and depression (HADS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), and specificity of the autobiographical memory (AMT). NEIS, HADS and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL were assessed at baseline (T0), 1 month later (post-treatment; T1), and at 1 month follow-up (T2). AMT was assessed at T0 and T1. Linear mixed models (intention to treat) were used to assess group differences in changes over time. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess group differences at T0, T1, and T2, and effect sizes (ES) were calculated at T1 and T2.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The course of ego-integrity (not despair) improved significantly over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .007) in the intervention group compared to the waiting-list control group, with moderate, but insignificant, effect sizes at T1 (ES = .42) and T2 (ES = .48). Compliance rate was 69% and total dropout rate was 28%, both primarily related to disease progression and death.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;LRT-MST seems effective among cancer patients in palliative care to improve the course of ego-integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b7c:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526418000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gitta Kleijn, Birgit I.

The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of paralytic poliomyelitis by a factor of 10,000 or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication. However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection. If poliovirus is reintroduced after OPV cessation, under what conditions will OPV vaccination be required to interrupt transmission? Can conditions exist in which OPV and WPV reintroduction present similar risks of transmission? To answer these questions, we built a multi-scale mathematical model of infection and transmission calibrated to data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies. At the within-host level, the model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and oral susceptibility to infection. At the between-host level, the model emulates the interaction of shedding and oral susceptibility with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the transmission rate in communities. Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low transmission rate settings and that OPV can be reintroduced and withdrawn as needed in moderate transmission rate settings. However, in high transmission rate settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. Absent population immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV. If post-cessation outbreak responses are followed by new vaccine-derived outbreaks, strategies to restore population immunity will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/To91iFbN0F4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16308305f07:446895:c2c34441</id><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524862800000</published><recrawled>1524851645910</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Famulare, Christian Selinger, Kevin A.

If post-cessation outbreak responses are followed by new vaccine-derived outbreaks, strategies to restore population immunity will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/To91iFbN0F4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><engagement>2</engagement><fingerprint>7b9efc57</fingerprint><author><name>Michael Famulare</name></author><crawled>1524850777863</crawled><updated>1524862800000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Assessing the stability of polio eradication after the withdrawal of oral polio vaccine</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002468</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002468</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002468</originId><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/To91iFbN0F4/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in tomato&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in tomato, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24611-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24611-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in tomato&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/F-NF4HifDkA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162f9bc368e:6c38d62:9f3b30f2</id><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524639600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in tomato&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in tomato, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24611-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24611-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in tomato&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/F-NF4HifDkA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>9b9434c8</fingerprint><title>Author Correction: Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in tomato</title><crawled>1524608284302</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Bhaskar Sharma</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24611-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24611-9</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24611-9</originId><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/F-NF4HifDkA/s41598-018-24611-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02355/20180430/images/medium/jp-2018-02355k_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02355&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Although heterosis has significantly contributed to increases in worldwide crop production, the molecular mechanisms regulating this phenomenon are still unknown. In the present study, we used a comparative proteomic approach to explore hybrid vigor via the proteome of both the popcorn L54 ♀ and P8 ♂ genotypes and the resultant UENF/UEM01 hybrid cross. To analyze the differentially abundant proteins involved in heterosis, we used the primary roots of these genotypes to analyze growth parameters and extract proteins. The results of the growth parameter analysis showed that the mid- and best-parent heterosis were positive for root length and root dry matter but negative for root fresh matter, seedling fresh matter, and protein content. The comparative proteomic analysis identified 1343 proteins in the primary roots of hybrid UENF/UEM01 and its parental lines; 220 proteins were differentially regulated in terms of protein abundance. The mass spectrometry proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier “PXD009436”. A total of 62 regulated proteins were classified as nonadditive, of which 53.2% were classified as high parent abundance (+), 17.8% as above-high parent abundance (+ +), 16.1% as below-low parent abundance (− −), and 12.9% as low parent abundance (-). A total of 22 biological processes were associated with nonadditive proteins; processes involving translation, ribosome biogenesis, and energy-related metabolism represented 45.2% of the nonadditive proteins. Our results suggest that heterosis in the popcorn hybrid UENF/UEM01 at an early stage of plant development is associated with an up-regulation of proteins related to synthesis and energy metabolism.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd3:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526331600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mathias F.

Understanding how knowledge is represented in the human brain is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. To date, most of the work on this topic has focused on knowledge representation in cortical areas and debated whether knowledge is represented in a distributed or localized fashion. Fang and colleagues provide evidence that brain connections and the white matter supporting such connections might play a significant role. The work opens new avenues of investigation, breaking through disciplinary boundaries across network neuroscience, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and classical lesion studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YwDVYOi5evM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16303202298:a8104d:a96d255</id><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524776400000</published><recrawled>1524765902232</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Franco Pestilli&lt;/p&gt;

High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been shown &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to impinge on telomere homeostasis in a number of ways. However, the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; interaction of viruses with the telomere homeostasis apparatus has not been previously explored. Since E6 and E7 are the main viral oncogenes and key for viral replication, we have explored here the short-term phenotypes of the genes in the context of defective telomere homeostasis. We examined the short-term phenotypes of E6 and E7 in a context where the Terc component of the telomerase holoenzyme was knocked out. We determined that Terc was dispensable for most oncogene-mediated phenotypes. Surprisingly, E7-mediated reduction of label retaining cells was found to be in part dependent on the presence of Terc. Under the conditions examined here, there appears to be no compelling evidence Terc is required for most short-term viral oncogene mediated phenotypes. Further studies will elucidate its role in longer-term phenotypes.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefba:11c251fd</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524776400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Charis Achilleos, Stella Michael, Katerina Strati&lt;/p&gt;

Bifidobacteria colonize the human gastrointestinal tract, vagina, oral cavity and breast milk. They influence human physiology and nutrition through health-promoting effects, play an important role as primary colonizers of the newborn gut, and contribute to vaginal microbiome homeostasis by producing lactic acid. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which bifidobacteria are transmitted from mother to infant remains in discussion. Moreover, studies have suggested that &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt; spp. have specializations for gut colonization, but comparisons of strains of the same bifidobacteria species from different body sites are lacking. Here, our objective was to compare the genomes of &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium breve&lt;/i&gt; (n = 17) and &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium longum&lt;/i&gt; (n = 26) to assess whether gut and vaginal isolates of either species were distinguishable based on genome content. Comparison of the general genome features showed that vaginal and gut isolates did not differ in size, GC content, number of genes and CRISPR, either for &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;breve&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longum&lt;/i&gt;. Average nucleotide identity and whole genome phylogeny analysis revealed that vaginal and gut isolates did not cluster separately. Vaginal and gut isolates also had a similar COG (Cluster of Orthologous Group) category distribution. Differences in the accessory genomes between vaginal and gut strains were observed, but were not sufficient to distinguish isolates based on their origin. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the vaginal and gut microbiomes are colonized by a shared community of &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, and further emphasize the potential importance of the maternal vaginal microbiome as a source of infant gut microbiota.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba1:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524517200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aline C.

Dairy farming is one the most important sectors of United Kingdom (UK) agriculture. It faces major challenges due to climate change, which will have direct impacts on dairy cows as a result of heat stress. In the absence of adaptations, this could potentially lead to considerable milk loss. Using an 11-member climate projection ensemble, as well as an ensemble of 18 milk loss estimation methods, temporal changes in milk production of UK dairy cows were estimated for the 21st century at a 25 km resolution in a spatially-explicit way. While increases in UK temperatures are projected to lead to relatively low average annual milk losses, even for southern UK regions (&amp;lt;180 kg/cow), the ‘hottest’ 25×25 km grid cell in the hottest year in the 2090s, showed an annual milk loss exceeding 1300 kg/cow. This figure represents approximately 17% of the potential milk production of today’s average cow. Despite the potential considerable inter-annual variability of annual milk loss, as well as the large differences between the climate projections, the variety of calculation methods is likely to introduce even greater uncertainty into milk loss estimations. To address this issue, a novel, more biologically-appropriate mechanism of estimating milk loss is proposed that provides more realistic future projections. We conclude that South West England is the region most vulnerable to climate change economically, because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore potentially high heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach £13.4M in average years and £33.8M in extreme years.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475069:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525813200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nándor Fodor, Andreas Foskolos, Cairistiona F.

Jasmonates (JAs) are signalling molecules involved in stress responses, development and secondary metabolism biosynthesis, although their roles in fleshy-fruit development and ripening processes are not well known. In strawberry fruit, it has been proposed that JAs could regulate the early development through the activation of the JAs biosynthesis. Moreover, it has been reported that JA treatment increases anthocyanin content in strawberry fruit involving the bioactive jasmonate biosynthesis. Nevertheless, JA signalling pathway, of which main components are the COI1-JAZ co-receptor and the MYC transcription factors (TFs), has not been characterized in strawberry until now. Here we identified and characterized the woodland strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;) JAZ and MYC genes as well as studied their expression during development and ripening stages in commercial strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;) fruit. We described twelve putative JAZ proteins and two MYC TFs, which showed high conservation with respect to their orthologs in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and in other fleshy-fruit species such as &lt;i&gt;Malus&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;domestica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; as revealed by gene synteny and phylogenetic analyses. Noteworthy, their expression levels exhibited a significant decrease from fruit development to ripening stages in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;, along with others of the JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaNINJA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FaJAM&lt;/i&gt;s, encoding for negative regulators of JA responses. Moreover, we found that main JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaMYC2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;FaJAZ1&lt;/i&gt; are promptly induced by JA treatment at early times in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit. These results suggest the conservation of the canonical JA signalling pathway in strawberry and a possible role of this pathway in early strawberry fruit development, which also correlates negatively with the beginning of the ripening process.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559151:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525986000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Adrián Garrido-Bigotes, Nicolás E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Effective HIV prevention requires efficient delivery of safe and efficacious drugs and optimization of user adherence. The user’s experiences with the drug, delivery system, and use parameters are critical to product acceptability and adherence. Prevention product developers have the opportunity to directly control a drug delivery system and its impact on acceptability and adherence, as well as product efficacy. Involvement of potential users during preclinical design and development can facilitate this process. We embedded a mixed methods user evaluation study into a safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) trial of a pod-intravaginal ring delivering antiretroviral agents.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;Women enrolled in two cohorts, ultimately evaluating the safety/PK of a pod-IVRs delivering TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, and/or TDF-FTC-MVC. A 7-day use period was targeted for each pod-IVR, regardless of drug or drug combination. During the clinical study, participants provided both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., in-depth interview) data capturing acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence behaviors. Initial sexual and reproductive health history surveys, daily diaries, a final acceptability and willingness to use survey, and a qualitative in-depth interview comprised the user evaluation data for each pod-IVR experienced by the participants.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Overall, the majority of participants (N = 10) reported being willing to use the pod-IVR platform for HIV prevention should it advance to market. Confidence to use the pod-IVR (e.g., insertion, removal) was high. There were no differences noted in the user experience of the pod-IVR platform; that is, whether the ring delivered TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, or TDF-FTC-MVC, users’ experiences of the ring were similar and acceptable. Participants did report specific experiences, both sensory and behavioral, that impacted their use behaviors with respect to the ring, and which could ultimately impact acceptability and adherence. These experiences, and user evaluations elicited by them, could both challenge use or be used to leverage use in future trials and product rollout once fully articulated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;High willingness-to-use data and lack of salient differences in user experiences related to use of the pod-IVR platform (regardless of agents delivered) suggests that the pod-IVR is a feasible and acceptable drug delivery device in and of itself. This finding holds promise both for an anti-HIV pod-IVR and, potentially, a multipurpose prevention pod-IVR that could deliver both prevention for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and contraception. Given the very early clinical trial context, further acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence data should continue to be explored, in the context of longer use periods (e.g., 28-day ring use), and in the contexts of sexual activity and menses. Using early design and development contexts to gain insights into potential challenges and facilitators of drug delivery systems such as the pod-IVR could save valuable resources and time as a potential biomedical technology moves through the clinical trial pipeline and into real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd7:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526331600000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kate M.

Synthetic biologists construct innovative genetic/biological systems to treat environmental, energy, and health problems. Many systems employ rewired cells for non-native product synthesis, while a few have employed the rewired cells as ‘smart’ devices with programmable function. Building on the latter, we developed a genetic construct to control and direct bacterial motility towards hydrogen peroxide, one of the body’s immune response signaling molecules. A motivation for this work is the creation of cells that can target and autonomously treat disease, the latter signaled by hydrogen peroxide release. Bacteria naturally move towards a variety of molecular cues (e.g., nutrients) in the process of chemotaxis. In this work, we engineered bacteria to recognize and move towards hydrogen peroxide, a non-native chemoattractant and potential toxin. Our system exploits &lt;i&gt;oxyRS&lt;/i&gt;, the native oxidative stress regulon of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. We first demonstrated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated upregulation motility regulator, CheZ. Using transwell assays, we showed a two-fold increase in net motility towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, using a 2D cell tracking system, we quantified bacterial motility descriptors including velocity, % running (of tumble/run motions), and a dynamic net directionality towards the molecular cue. In CheZ mutants, we found that increased H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration (0–200 μM) and induction time resulted in increased running speeds, ultimately reaching the native &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; wild-type speed of ~22 μm/s with a ~45–65% ratio of running to tumbling. Finally, using a microfluidic device with stable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gradients, we characterized responses and the potential for “programmed” directionality towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in quiescent fluids.

A structural-bioinformatics-based computational methodology and framework have been developed for the design of antibodies to targets of interest. RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samples the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody to an antigen in highly customizable protocols for the design of antibodies in a broad range of applications. The program samples antibody sequences and structures by grafting structures from a widely accepted set of the canonical clusters of CDRs (North et al., &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Mol&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Biol&lt;/i&gt;., 406:228–256, 2011). It then performs sequence design according to amino acid sequence profiles of each cluster, and samples CDR backbones using a flexible-backbone design protocol incorporating cluster-based CDR constraints. Starting from an existing experimental or computationally modeled antigen-antibody structure, RAbD can be used to redesign a single CDR or multiple CDRs with loops of different length, conformation, and sequence. We rigorously benchmarked RAbD on a set of 60 diverse antibody–antigen complexes, using two design strategies—optimizing total Rosetta energy and optimizing interface energy alone. We utilized two novel metrics for measuring success in computational protein design. The design risk ratio (DRR) is equal to the frequency of recovery of native CDR lengths and clusters divided by the frequency of sampling of those features during the Monte Carlo design procedure. Ratios greater than 1.0 indicate that the design process is picking out the native more frequently than expected from their sampled rate. We achieved DRRs for the non-H3 CDRs of between 2.4 and 4.0. The antigen risk ratio (ARR) is the ratio of frequencies of the native amino acid types, CDR lengths, and clusters in the output decoys for simulations performed in the presence and absence of the antigen. For CDRs, we achieved cluster ARRs as high as 2.5 for L1 and 1.5 for H2. For sequence design simulations without CDR grafting, the overall recovery for the native amino acid types for residues that contact the antigen in the native structures was 72% in simulations performed in the presence of the antigen and 48% in simulations performed without the antigen, for an ARR of 1.5. For the non-contacting residues, the ARR was 1.08. This shows that the sequence profiles are able to maintain the amino acid types of these conserved, buried sites, while recovery of the exposed, contacting residues requires the presence of the antigen-antibody interface. We tested RAbD experimentally on both a lambda and kappa antibody–antigen complex, successfully improving their affinities 10 to 50 fold by replacing individual CDRs of the native antibody with new CDR lengths and clusters.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PVAny09_uEE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16308310122:44e8c:ed160cc3</id><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1524862800000</published><recrawled>1524850922255</recrawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jared Adolf-Bryfogle, Oleks Kalyuzhniy, Michael Kubitz, Brian D.

Despite the existence of the prophylactic Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, infection by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb) remains a major public health issue causing up to 1.8 million annual deaths worldwide. Increasing prevalence of Mtb strains resistant to antibiotics represents an urgent threat for global health that has prompted a search for alternative treatment regimens not subject to development of resistance. Immunotherapy constitutes a promising approach to improving current antibiotic treatments through engagement of the host’s immune system. We designed a multi-antigenic and multiphasic vaccine, based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus, denoted MVATG18598, which expresses ten antigens classically described as representative of each of different phases of Mtb infection. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; analysis coupled with multiple-passage evaluation demonstrated that this vaccine is genetically stable, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. fit for manufacturing. Using different mouse strains, we show that MVATG18598 vaccination results in both Th1-associated T-cell responses and cytolytic activity, targeting all 10 vaccine-expressed Mtb antigens. In chronic post-exposure mouse models, MVATG18598 vaccination in combination with an antibiotic regimen decreases the bacterial burden in the lungs of infected mice, compared with chemotherapy alone, and is associated with long-lasting antigen-specific Th1-type T cell and antibody responses. In one model, co-treatment with MVATG18598 prevented relapse of the disease after treatment completion, an important clinical goal. Overall, results demonstrate the capacity of the therapeutic MVATG18598 vaccine to improve efficacy of chemotherapy against TB. These data support further development of this novel immunotherapeutic in the treatment of Mtb infections.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a193:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525294800000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stéphane Leung-Theung-Long, Charles-Antoine Coupet, Marie Gouanvic, Doris Schmitt, Aurélie Ray, Chantal Hoffmann, Huguette Schultz, Sandeep Tyagi, Heena Soni, Paul J.

Despite the existence of the prophylactic Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, infection by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb) remains a major public health issue causing up to 1.8 million annual deaths worldwide. Increasing prevalence of Mtb strains resistant to antibiotics represents an urgent threat for global health that has prompted a search for alternative treatment regimens not subject to development of resistance.

A striking example is provided by cyanobacteria, which perform photosynthesis during the day to fix carbon. These organisms not only face the challenge of rewiring their proteome every 12 hours, but also the necessity of storing the fixed carbon in the form of glycogen to fuel processes during the night. In this manuscript, we extend the framework developed by Hwa and coworkers (Scott et al., Science 330, 1099 (2010)) for quantifying the relatinship between growth and proteome composition to circadian metabolism. We then apply this framework to investigate the circadian metabolism of the cyanobacterium Cyanothece, which not only fixes carbon during the day, but also nitrogen during the night, storing it in the polymer cyanophycin. Our analysis reveals that the need to store carbon and nitrogen tends to generate an extreme growth strategy, in which the cells predominantly grow during the day, as observed experimentally. This strategy maximizes the growth rate over 24 hours, and can be quantitatively understood by the bacterial growth laws. Our analysis also shows that the slow relaxation of the proteome, arising from the slow growth rate, puts a severe constraint on implementing this optimal strategy. Yet, the capacity to estimate the time of the day, enabled by the circadian clock, makes it possible to anticipate the daily changes in the environment and mount a response ahead of time. This significantly enhances the growth rate by counteracting the detrimental effects of the slow proteome relaxation.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1636236a514:3552995:93d646dc</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526281200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Many organisms repartition their proteome in a circadian fashion in response to the daily nutrient changes in their environment.

Bloodstream infection (BSI) and associated sepsis represent a major source of mortality in industrialized countries. Prompt treatment with targeted antibiotics affects both the financial impact and the clinical outcome of BSI: every hour gained in initiating the correct antimicrobial therapy significantly increases the probability of patient survival. However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%. The clinical significance of discrepant results was evaluated reviewing the patients’ clinical records and the results of additional relevant microbiological tests. The data here obtained support the ability of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay to identify a broad range of bacteria directly from primary whole blood samples, within eight hours.

Consistently, the tension patterns deduced from the gaping patterns in &lt;i&gt;qua1&lt;/i&gt; matched the pattern of cortical microtubules, which are thought to align with maximal tension, in wild-type organs.

Here we take advantage of the adhesion defects in the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis &lt;/i&gt;mutant &lt;i&gt;quasimodo1 (qua1) &lt;/i&gt;to deduce stress patterns in tissues. By reducing the water potential and epidermal tension &lt;i&gt;in planta&lt;/i&gt;, we rescued the adhesion defects in &lt;i&gt;qua1&lt;/i&gt;, formally associating gaping and tensile stress patterns in the mutant. Using suboptimal water potential conditions, we revealed the relative contributions of shape- and growth-derived stress in prescribing maximal tension directions in aerial tissues. Consistently, the tension patterns deduced from the gaping patterns in &lt;i&gt;qua1&lt;/i&gt; matched the pattern of cortical microtubules, which are thought to align with maximal tension, in wild-type organs. Conversely, loss of epidermis continuity in the &lt;i&gt;qua1 &lt;/i&gt;mutant hampered supracellular microtubule alignments, revealing that coordination through tensile stress requires cell-cell adhesion.</content></summary><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34460</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34460</canonicalUrl><engagement>17</engagement><fingerprint>38105337</fingerprint><keywords><item>Plant Biology</item></keywords><crawled>1524485622982</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>A tension-adhesion feedback loop in plant epidermis</title><author><name>stephane.verger@ens-lyon.fr (Arezki Boudaoud)</name></author><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34460</link><published>1524441600000</published><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34460</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>Cocaine addiction is a global health problem that causes substantial damage to the health of addicted individuals around the world.

Although maternal immune responses have been implicated in pregnancy complications, fetal immune responses against maternal antigens are often not considered. To examine the fetal immune system in the relevant clinical setting, we analyzed maternal and cord blood in patients with PTL and healthy term controls. We report here that the cord blood of preterm infants has higher amounts of inflammatory cytokines and a greater activation of dendritic cells. Moreover, preterm cord blood is characterized by the presence of a population of central memory cells with a type 1 T helper phenotype, which is absent in term infants, and an increase in maternal microchimerism. T cells from preterm infants mount a robust proliferative, proinflammatory response to maternal antigens compared to term infants yet fail to respond to third-party antigens. Furthermore, we show that T cells from preterm infants stimulate uterine myometrial contractility through interferon- and tumor necrosis factor–α. In parallel, we found that adoptive transfer of activated T cells directly into mouse fetuses resulted in pregnancy loss.

In 2015, several provinces in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) experienced a vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak. This survey was conducted (i) to evaluate the vaccination coverage in different settings and cohorts using the seroprevalence of anti-poliovirus (PV) antibodies as a surrogate measure, and (ii) to explore the usefulness of an ELISA in a country with limited resources and a specific epidemiological setting. IgG antibodies were assessed by ELISA in Lao children (n = 1216) and adults (n = 1228), including blood donors and health care workers. Protective antibody titers against the 3 vaccine serotypes were determined by microneutralization (VNT) in a subset of participants. More than 92% of the children had anti-poliovirus antibodies, regardless of nutritional status or access to health care, highlighting the success of the vaccination outreach activities in the country. In contrast, anti-poliovirus seroprevalence reached only 81.7% in blood donors and 71.9% in health care workers. Participants born before the introduction of poliovirus vaccination in Lao PDR were considerably less likely to be seropositive. These findings align with the epidemiology of the outbreak. Neutralizing antibodies against at least one of the 3 poliovirus serotypes were detected in all children (99/99) and 93/99 had antibodies against all serotypes. Similarly, all health care workers had neutralizing antibodies against at least one and 92/99 against all serotypes. The comparison of both assays shows an acceptable underestimation of vaccine coverage in children by ELISA, but a low sensitivity of the ELISA in the adults. We show that the ELISA is a reasonable alternative to the VNT in particular in vaccinated children, that an improved version should be serotype specific, and that negativity thresholds should be revisited for optimal sensitivity and specificity. Thus, polio-free countries with an uncertain vaccination coverage and limited laboratory capacity, that are at risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks or of re-importation of wild poliovirus may benefit from an improved ELISA for cohort studies to evaluate their immunization program in children.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b85:93d646dc</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526418000000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maude Pauly, Antony P.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Non-medical prescribing has the potential to deliver innovative healthcare within limited finances. However, uptake has been slow, and a proportion of non-medical prescribers do not use the qualification. This systematic review aimed to describe the facilitators and barriers to non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The systematic review and thematic analysis included qualitative and mixed methods papers reporting facilitators and barriers to independent non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom. The following databases were searched to identify relevant papers: AMED, ASSIA, BNI, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, Open Grey, Open access theses and dissertations, and Web of Science. Papers published between 2006 and March 2017 were included. Studies were quality assessed using a validated tool (QATSDD), then underwent thematic analysis. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015019786).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 3991 potentially relevant identified studies, 42 were eligible for inclusion. The studies were generally of moderate quality (83%), and most (71%) were published 2007–2012. The nursing profession dominated the studies (30/42).

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Non-medical prescribing has the potential to deliver innovative healthcare within limited finances. However, uptake has been slow, and a proportion of non-medical prescribers do not use the qualification. This systematic review aimed to describe the facilitators and barriers to non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The systematic review and thematic analysis included qualitative and mixed methods papers reporting facilitators and barriers to independent non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom. The following databases were searched to identify relevant papers: AMED, ASSIA, BNI, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, Open Grey, Open access theses and dissertations, and Web of Science. Papers published between 2006 and March 2017 were included. Studies were quality assessed using a validated tool (QATSDD), then underwent thematic analysis. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015019786).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 3991 potentially relevant identified studies, 42 were eligible for inclusion. The studies were generally of moderate quality (83%), and most (71%) were published 2007–2012. The nursing profession dominated the studies (30/42). Thematic analysis identified three overarching themes: non-medical prescriber, human factors, and organisational aspects. Each theme consisted of several sub-themes; the four most highly mentioned were ‘medical professionals’, ‘area of competence’, ‘impact on time’ and ‘service’. Sub-themes were frequently interdependent on each other, having the potential to act as a barrier or facilitator depending on circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Addressing the identified themes and subthemes enables strategies to be developed to support and optimise non-medical prescribing. Further research is required to identify if similar themes are encountered by other non-medical prescribing groups than nurses and pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196471</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><fingerprint>a188ce10</fingerprint><title>Facilitators and barriers to non-medical prescribing – A systematic review and thematic synthesis</title><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Emma Graham-Clarke</name></author><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196471</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196471</originId><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196471</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><unread>True</unread><description>Quantifying the functional relations between the nodes in a network based on local observations is a key challenge in studying complex systems.

I remember wondering what the chemical biology community would make out of these things, and I wanted to report on at least one ingenious answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general situation in the field is when you have a big pile of RNA or DNA pieces, and you want to analyze them – sort them out, determine how many different ones are in there and which ones are present more than the others. This is the underlying problem that “RNA-seq” assays are trying to answer: when you perturb some cells by changing something about their environment, what genes’ transcriptions get affected? What protein levels go up or down? One reasonable proxy for those is the levels of various mRNAs, but there’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of RNA in a cell, and sorting through it looking for changes has been nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some steps that a lot of these assays use to clean up the sample and get it into a form that can be more easily analyzed. The clean-up often involves some method to get all the ribosomal RNA out of there or to direct your readout away from it somehow, because that’s the majority of the RNA in cell lysate, and you don’t want your assay technology chasing it. Then there’s usually a fragmentation step, to break up the mRNAs into useful-sized pieces (which will be reassembled later on, computationally). Another common step is the use of reverse transcriptase enzymes to make complementary DNA out of all those mRNA pieces, because our techniques to amplify and sequence DNA are so flippin’ powerful. There’s often a step that tries to stick some sort of unique tag/label/identifier onto each DNA piece as well, using ligase enzymes, to aid in keeping track of all this stuff. These enzymes are the key to the whole business, along with modern sequencer technology and its associated computing prowess to reassemble everything from the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickSeq&quot;&gt;“Click-seq” variant&lt;/a&gt; works, though. You take your pile of mRNAs and expose them to reverse transcriptase, as before. But this time, you feed in a set amount of azide-containing nucleotides along with the usual mix of normal 2-deoxynucleotides to make your complementary DNAs. The thing is, these are chain-terminating residues for the RT enzyme, so what you end up with is a random heap of cDNA pieces, all of which end (on the 3′) with an azidonucleotide. And these turn into handles for introducing those labels/barcodes/identifiers. This way you avoid having to do a separate fragmentation step, because the reverse transcriptase has already fragmented things for you as it randomly choked on the azidonucleotides. And you avoid having to use the ligase enzymes to label everything, which can be expensive – you put those on via azide/alkyne reactions instead. The clicked oligos are still viable for PCR and sequencing, as it turns out, so that part of the process works fine, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7514-3_6&quot;&gt;the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; avoids some recombination artifacts that the other variants can be vulnerable to (ligases ligating the wrong things, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, it’s also good for picking up real recombination events that might be biologically relevant, but rare on the absolute scale. This happens with some viruses, and the technique &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006365&quot;&gt;has been used&lt;/a&gt; to look at so-called “defective interfering” RNAs which emerge over time in viral infections. These are somewhat mysterious – in some cases, they seem to hijack and (as the name says) perhaps interfere with the usual infectious cycle, but they may also prolong it and make it worse. It looks like some viruses have evolved to let these things accumulate, and there must be a reason for that, too. The only way to unravel all that is with a good enough RNA analysis technique, and the clicked nucleotides just may be providing one.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/21/clicked-dna-from-lab-curiosity-to-analytical-technique</canonicalUrl><engagement>17</engagement><fingerprint>41cc32b5</fingerprint><keywords><item>Analytical Chemistry</item><item>Biological News</item><item>Chemical Biology</item><item>Chemical News</item><item>Infectious Diseases</item></keywords><crawled>1526915728046</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Clicked DNA: From Lab Curiosity to Analytical Technique</title><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13553</link><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13553</originId><alternate><item><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/21/clicked-dna-from-lab-curiosity-to-analytical-technique</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outlier response to anti-PD1 in uveal melanoma reveals germline &lt;i&gt;MBD4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in hypermutated tumors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlier response to anti-PD1 in uveal melanoma reveals germline &amp;lt;i&gt;MBD4&amp;lt;/i&gt; mutations in hypermutated tumors, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04322-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04322-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hypermutated tumors respond more favorably to checkpoint inhibitor-based immune therapy.

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Advanced liver fibrosis is an important predictor of liver disease progression and mortality, and current guidelines recommend screening for complications of cirrhosis once patients develop F3 fibrosis. Our study compared liver disease progression and survival in patients with stage 3 (F3) and stage 4 (F4) fibrosis on liver biopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective study of patients with F3 or F4 on liver biopsy followed for development of liver disease complications (variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy); hepatocellular carcinoma, and survival (overall and transplant free survival).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2488 patients receiving liver biopsy between 01/02 and 12/12, a total of 294 (171 F3) were analyzed. Over a median follow up period of 3 years, patients with F4 (mean age 53 years, 63% male) compared to F3 (mean age 49 years, 43% male) had higher five year cumulative probability of any decompensation (38% vs. 14%, p&amp;lt;0.0001), including variceal bleed (10% vs. 4%, p = 0.014), ascites (21% vs. 9%, p = 0.0014), and hepatic encephalopathy (14% vs. 5%, p = 0.003). F4 patients also had lower overall 5-year survival (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.003) and transplant free survival (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.002). Probability of hepatocellular carcinoma in 5 years after biopsy was similar between F3 and F4 (1.2% vs. 2%, p = 0.54).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Compared to F4 stage, patients with F3 fibrosis have decreased risk for development of liver disease complications and better survival.

In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples. Scaled quantile residual plots are also introduced as an effective diagnostic to visualize the quality of the estimated probability densities. Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6d:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526072400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jenny Farmer, Donald Jacobs&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Calcifications within the hippocampus were recently described for the first time on computed tomography (CT). These calcifications appeared in patients older than 50 years, the prevalence increases with age and they may be associated with cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to determine the histological basis (the presence, severity and location) of these CT-detected hippocampal calcifications of post-mortem brains.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;CT scans of seven post-mortem brains were scored for the presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of hippocampal calcification. After this, samples from nine hippocampi (bilateral in two brains, unilateral in five brains) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to indicate the cytoarchitecture, with Elastica van Gieson to analyse the elastic connective tissue of the vessel walls and with von Kossa for detection of calcium.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In four brains (six hippocampi), calcifications were both found on CT and in corresponding histology. In three brains (three hippocampi), calcifications were absent on CT and corresponding histology. In histology, mild calcifications were located in the tail and severe calcifications involved the tail, body and sometimes the head of the hippocampus. The calcifications co-localised with precapillaries, capillaries and arteries of the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus and the Cornu Ammonis 1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this study, calcifications of the hippocampus as seen on CT scans were histologically located in vascular structures of the tail, body and head of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f73:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1526072400000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Melissa E.

Heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans and mice cause severe ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). Abnormalities include pupil displacement, corneal opacity, iridocorneal adhesions, and variable intraocular pressure, as well as some retinal and vascular defects. It is presently not known what source of BMP4 is responsible for these defects, as BMP4 is expressed in several developing ocular and surrounding tissues. In particular, BMP4 is expressed in the ciliary margins of the optic cup which give rise to anterior segment structures such as the ciliary body and iris, making it a good candidate for the required source of BMP4 for anterior segment development. Here, we test whether ciliary margin-derived BMP4 is required for ocular development using two different conditional knockout approaches. In addition, we compared the conditional deletion phenotypes with &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous null mice. Morphological, molecular, and functional assays were performed on adult mutant mice, including histology, immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging, and intraocular pressure measurements. Surprisingly, in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mutants, our analyses revealed that the anterior and posterior segments of &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockouts developed normally. These results indicate that ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development, although subtle alterations could not be ruled out. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anterior and posterior phenotypes observed in &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous animals showed a strong propensity to co-occur, suggesting a common, non-cell autonomous source for these defects.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475066:2835af05</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1525813200000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.
