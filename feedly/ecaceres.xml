The bacterial phylum Verrucomicrobia was formally described two decades ago and originally believed to be a minor member of many ecosystems; however, it is now recognized as ubiquitous and abundant in both soil and aquatic systems. Nevertheless, knowledge of the drivers of its relative abundance and within-phylum habitat preferences remains sparse, especially in lake systems. Here, we documented the distribution of Verrucomicrobia in 12 inland lakes in Southeastern Michigan, a Laurentian Great Lake (Lake Michigan), and a freshwater estuary, which span a gradient in lake sizes, depths, residence times, and trophic states. A wide range of physical and geochemical parameters was covered by sampling seasonally from the surface and bottom of each lake, and by separating samples into particle-associated and free-living fractions. On average, Verrucomicrobia was the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most abundant phylum (range 1.7–41.7%). Fraction, season, station, and depth explained up to 70% of the variance in Verrucomicrobia community composition and preference for these habitats was phylogenetically conserved at the class-level. When relative abundance was linearly modeled against environmental data, Verrucomicrobia and non-Verrucomicrobia bacterial community composition correlated to similar quantitative environmental parameters, although there were lake system-dependent differences and &gt; 55% of the variance remained unexplained. A majority of the phylum exhibited preference for the particle-associated fraction and two classes (Opitutae and Verrucomicrobiae) were identified to be more abundant during the spring season. This study highlights the high relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia in north temperate lake systems and expands insights into drivers of within-phylum habitat preferences of the Verrucomicrobia.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Edna Chiang, Marian L.

Background &amp;amp; aims &lt;p&gt;To determine the prognostic potential of classic and novel serologic antibodies regarding unfavorable disease course in a prospective ulcerative colitis (UC) patient cohort, since few and conflicting data are available in the literature regarding this matter.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;187 consecutive patients were studied prospectively (median follow-up: 135 months) from a single referral IBD center in Hungary. Sera were tested for different IgA/IgG type autoantibodies (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic [ANCA], anti-DNA-bound-lactoferrin [anti-LFS], anti-goblet cell [anti-GAB] and anti-pancreatic [PAB: anti-CUZD1 and anti-GP2)]) by indirect immunofluorescence technique and for anti-microbial (anti-&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; [ASCA] IgG/IgA and anti-OMP Plus&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; IgA) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 73.6%, 62.4% and 11.2% of UC patients were positive for IgA/IgG type of atypical perinuclear-ANCA, anti-LFS and anti-GAB, respectively. Occurrences of PABs were 9.6%, while ASCA IgA/IgG and anti-OMP IgA were 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Antibody status was stable over time. IgA type PABs were more prevalent in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (37.5% vs. 4.7% for anti-CUZD1 and 12.5% vs. 0% for anti-GP2, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt; for both). IgA type ASCA and anti-CUZD1 antibodies were associated with higher risk of requirement for long-term immunosuppressant therapy in Kaplan-Meier analysis (pLogRank &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt; for both). However, in multivariate Cox-regression analysis only ASCA IgA (HR: 2.74, 95%CI: 1.46–5.14, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;) remained independent predictor. UC-related hospitalization due to disease activity was only associated with multiple antibody positivity (for 3 or more; HR 2.03 [95% CI: 1.16–3.56]; p = 0.013). None of the individual antibodies or their combination was associated with the risk of development of extensive disease or colectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Even with low prevalence rates, present study gives further evidence to the role of certain antibodies as markers for distinct phenotype and disease outcome in UC. Considering the result of the multivariate analysis the novel antibodies investigated do not seem to be associated with poor clinical outcome in UC, only a classic antibody, IgA subtype ASCA remained an independent predictor of long-term immunosuppressive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gyorgy Kovacs, Nora Sipeki, Boglarka Suga, Tamas Tornai, Kai Fechner, Gary L.

IgA type PABs were more prevalent in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (37.5% vs. 4.7% for anti-CUZD1 and 12.5% vs. 0% for anti-GP2, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt; for both). IgA type ASCA and anti-CUZD1 antibodies were associated with higher risk of requirement for long-term immunosuppressant therapy in Kaplan-Meier analysis (pLogRank &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt; for both). However, in multivariate Cox-regression analysis only ASCA IgA (HR: 2.74, 95%CI: 1.46–5.14, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;) remained independent predictor. UC-related hospitalization due to disease activity was only associated with multiple antibody positivity (for 3 or more; HR 2.03 [95% CI: 1.16–3.56]; p = 0.013). None of the individual antibodies or their combination was associated with the risk of development of extensive disease or colectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Even with low prevalence rates, present study gives further evidence to the role of certain antibodies as markers for distinct phenotype and disease outcome in UC. Considering the result of the multivariate analysis the novel antibodies investigated do not seem to be associated with poor clinical outcome in UC, only a classic antibody, IgA subtype ASCA remained an independent predictor of long-term immunosuppressive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522998000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>BayesENproteomics: Bayesian elastic nets for quantification of proteoforms in complex samples [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295527v1?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1629cc1d9e8:515c3c:9aea0a7d</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/06/295527</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295527v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>914c67e4</fingerprint><author><name>Mallikarjun, V.</name></author><crawled>1523048372712</crawled><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295527v1?rss=1</link><description>Multivariate regression modelling provides a statistically powerful means of quantifying the effects of a given treatment while compensating for sources of variation and noise, such as variability between human donors and the behaviour of different peptides during mass spectrometry.

The structure and function of clinical dosage insulin and its analogues were assessed. This included ‘native insulins’ (human recombinant, bovine, porcine), ‘fast-acting analogues’ (aspart, glulisine, lispro) and ‘slow-acting analogues’ (glargine, detemir, degludec). Analytical ultracentrifugation, both sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments, were employed to yield distributions of both molar mass and sedimentation coefficient of all nine insulins. Size exclusion chromatography, coupled to multi-angle light scattering, was also used to explore the function of these analogues. On ultracentrifugation analysis, the insulins under investigation were found to be in numerous conformational states, however the majority of insulins were present in a primarily hexameric conformation. This was true for all native insulins and two fast-acting analogues. However, glargine was present as a dimer, detemir was a multi-hexameric system, degludec was a dodecamer (di-hexamer) and glulisine was present as a dimer-hexamer-dihexamer system. However, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the two hexameric fast-acting analogues (aspart and lispro) dissociated into monomers and dimers due to the lack of zinc in the mobile phase.

Gillis&lt;/p&gt;
The structure and function of clinical dosage insulin and its analogues were assessed. This included ‘native insulins’ (human recombinant, bovine, porcine), ‘fast-acting analogues’ (aspart, glulisine, lispro) and ‘slow-acting analogues’ (glargine, detemir, degludec). Analytical ultracentrifugation, both sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments, were employed to yield distributions of both molar mass and sedimentation coefficient of all nine insulins. Size exclusion chromatography, coupled to multi-angle light scattering, was also used to explore the function of these analogues. On ultracentrifugation analysis, the insulins under investigation were found to be in numerous conformational states, however the majority of insulins were present in a primarily hexameric conformation. This was true for all native insulins and two fast-acting analogues. However, glargine was present as a dimer, detemir was a multi-hexameric system, degludec was a dodecamer (di-hexamer) and glulisine was present as a dimer-hexamer-dihexamer system. However, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the two hexameric fast-acting analogues (aspart and lispro) dissociated into monomers and dimers due to the lack of zinc in the mobile phase. This comprehensive study is the first time all nine insulins have been characterised in this way, the first time that insulin detemir have been studied using analytical ultracentrifugation and the first time that insulins aspart and glulisine have been studied using sedimentation equilibrium. The structure and function of these clinically administered insulins is of critical importance and this research adds novel data to an otherwise complex functional physiological protein.</content></content></item><item><published>1521567126000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/12/E2752/F5.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>369</height><width>440</width></visual><unread>True</unread><title>BRICHOS domain of Bri2 inhibits islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) fibril formation and toxicity in human beta cells [Cell Biology]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2752.short?rss=1</originId><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6f4:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2752</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2752.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>9864c848</fingerprint><author><name>Marie E.

The folding of proteins with a complex knot is still an unresolved question. Based on representative members of Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolases (UCHs) that contain the 5&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knot in the native state, we explain how UCHs are able to unfold and refold &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; reversibly within the structure-based model. In particular, we identify two, topologically different folding/unfolding pathways and corroborate our results with experiment, recreating the chevron plot. We show that confinement effect of chaperonin or weak crowding greatly facilitates folding, simultaneously slowing down the unfolding process of UCHs, compared with bulk conditions. Finally, we analyze the existence of knots in the denaturated state of UCHs. The results of the work show that the crowded environment of the cell should have a positive effect on the kinetics of complex knotted proteins, especially when proteins with deeper knots are found in this family.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IQnzANgGzpM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yani Zhao, Pawel Dabrowski-Tumanski, Szymon Niewieczerzal, Joanna I.

Background &amp;amp; aims &lt;p&gt;The causes of gastrointestinal complaints in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remain poorly understood. Altered nerve function has emerged as an important pathogenic factor as IBS mucosal biopsy supernatants consistently activate enteric and sensory neurons. We investigated the neurally active molecular components of such supernatants from patients with IBS and quiescent ulcerative colitis (UC).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Effects of supernatants from 7 healthy controls (HC), 20 IBS and 12 UC patients on human and guinea pig submucous neurons were studied with neuroimaging techniques. We identify differentially expressed proteins with proteome analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Nerve activation by IBS supernatants was prevented by the protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) antagonist SCHE79797. UC supernatants also activated enteric neurons through protease dependent mechanisms but without PAR1 involvement. Proteome analysis of the supernatants identified 204 proteins, among them 17 proteases as differentially expressed between IBS, UC and HC. Of those the four proteases elastase 3a, chymotrypsin C, proteasome subunit type beta-2 and an unspecified isoform of complement C3 were significantly more abundant in IBS compared to HC and UC supernatants. Of eight proteases, which were upregulated in IBS, the combination of elastase 3a, cathepsin L and proteasome alpha subunit-4 showed the highest prediction accuracy of 98% to discriminate between IBS and HC groups. Elastase synergistically potentiated the effects of histamine and serotonin–the two other main neuroactive substances in the IBS supernatants. A serine protease inhibitor isolated from the probiotic &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium longum&lt;/i&gt; NCC2705 (SERPIN&lt;sub&gt;BL&lt;/sub&gt;), known to inhibit elastase-like proteases, prevented nerve activation by IBS supernatants.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Proteases in IBS and UC supernatants were responsible for nerve activation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Since 1946 the controlled human infection model (CHIM) for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; has been used to improve understanding of disease pathogenesis, describe clinical and immunologic responses to infection and as a tool for vaccine development. As the frequency and intent for use in vaccine comparisons increases, standardization of the primary endpoint definition is necessary.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subject-level data were obtained from previously conducted experimental &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM studies. Signs and symptoms severity were categorized consistently across all studies. Sign and symptom correlations were estimated and univariate models were utilized to describe the association between stool output and other &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt;-attributable signs and symptoms. Multiple correspondence and hierarchical clustering analyses were performed to describe the co-occurrence of signs and symptoms. A disease score is proposed based on the co-occurrence of these events.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data were obtained on 54 subjects receiving 800 to 2000 colony forming units (cfu) of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt;. The median maximum 24 hour stool output was 514 ml (IQR: 300, 998 ml) with a median frequency of 6 (IQR: 4, 9). Subjects reported abdominal pain or cramps (81.5%), headache (66.7%) and anorexia (64.8%), 50.0% had a fever and 27.8% had gross blood in multiple loose stools. Multiple correspondence analyses highlighted co-occurrence of symptoms based on severity. A 3-parameter disease severity score predicted shigellosis endpoints and better differentiated disease spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Dichotomous endpoints for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM fail to fully account for disease variability. An ordinal disease score characterizing the breadth of disease severity may enable a better characterization of shigellosis and can decrease sample size requirements. Furthermore, the disease severity score may be a useful tool for portfolio management by enabling prioritization across vaccine candidates with comparable efficacy estimates using dichotomous endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chad K.

This is one of those questions that improves on further inspection – or deteriorates, according to your point of view, because it just keeps on getting more complicated. For decades, there was no good answer at all, but then there was “It reduces signaling in the inflammation pathways”, followed by “OK, it seems to do that by decreasing this prostaglandin signaling molecule” and “Ah, it does that by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, a key enzyme in the pathway to make those”. Then we moved to “Hold it, there’s more than one cyclooxygenase”, which is how we ended up with the COX-2 inhibitors like Vioxx, which led to “You know, the functions of these two are more complicated than we even thought”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on top of all these, there are clearly effects of NSAID drugs that have nothing to do with the COX enzymes at all. Blood clotting you can pretty much chalk up to the COX isoforms, but there are more things going on, and they’re very poorly defined. Which brings up a more general question: how do you ever know about all the things that a small-molecule drug might be doing in a living system? The answer is, you don’t. That’s not generally appreciated outside the biomedical professions, but it’s the truth. We don’t have some way to track things around and watch them interact at a molecule level through out a cell or an organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe. Mapping compound-protein interactions is a big part of chemical biology, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b11639&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt; from the Woo lab at Harvard shows an attempt to track small molecules in just this way. It uses photoaffinity labeling, via the now-nearly-standard combination tag of a diazirine and an acetylene, which lets you form a covalent bond to (most) of the thing the molecule of interest is spending time next to, and on the back end of the process, it uses isotope-labeled tags on the acetylene-click-conjugation step to give the mass spec detection a much higher signal/noise. Just digging through the whole cellular proteome without the kind of validation that isotope tagging gives you is a tall order, but the deliberately-weird-mass-combination effect of the stable isotope tags moves things up out of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three NSAIDs are given the treatment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen&quot;&gt;naproxen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celecoxib&quot;&gt;celecoxib&lt;/a&gt; (Celebrex), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin&quot;&gt;indomethacin&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a good spread of activity: naproxen hits both COX-1 and COX-2 pretty much equally, celecoxib is of course a COX-2 selective compound, and indomethacin is in a structurally distinct class that’s already known to have some other modes of action. &lt;em&gt;(Update:&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja408322b&quot;&gt; here’s work&lt;/a&gt; from another group on an alkyne-tagged aspirin derivative, which also interacts with a long list of cellular proteins).&lt;/em&gt; All the photolabel-derivatized compounds were still active against COX enzymes (albeit with somewhat lower affinity), and all of them could be displaced by the parent compounds in competition assays. All of them photo-labeled COX-2 in an &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiment, as they certainly should, and this experiment was used to validate the mass spec analysis methods for the whole-cell experiments. (For example, each of these compounds produces six or seven different photoadducts, depending on which nearby amino acid gets snagged by the reactive carbene that forms from the diazirene, and the group was able to see and account for all of these without difficulty).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens in cells? They tried the dosing/photolabeling experiment in Jurkat cells, along with experiments with photoactive negative control (non-NSAID) compounds. About 700 proteins were labeled in all, with quite a bit of overlap between the three NSAIDs (40% of them are hit by all three), and that figure alone should make a person stop and think a bit: &lt;em&gt;as simple and widely used a molecule as naproxen binds to hundreds of proteins well enough to photolabel them&lt;/em&gt;. No, we don’t know the details of what’s going on in there, do we? Admittedly, that’s at a high concentration (250 micromolar), but (1) patients take whopping doses of this stuff in the real world, and (2) the majority of these interactions also showed up at a 50 micromolar dose as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same set of experiments was also run in K562 cells, a leukemia line. In this case, there were 513 enriched protein targets and &lt;em&gt;only 206 of them overlapped&lt;/em&gt; with the set from the Jurkat cells. And that’s also something to think about – not only do small, well-known compounds like these interact with a long list of proteins, that list can change dramatically in different cell backgrounds. Only about 30% of the total list of proteins have ever been report to interact with any small molecules at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of these doesn’t show any particular compartmentalization effects in the cells; it pretty much tracks protein abundance across the cytoplasm, various organelles, nucleus and so on. A closer look at the proteins and their interaction sites can be found in the paper, but one thing worth mentioning is a “hot spot” in histone H2A, which is certainly not a target that anyone had been thinking about for NSAIDs, to my knowledge. Assigning all the specific sites of labeling across the proteome is still beyond current technology, although you can think of some experiments that would help narrow things down a lot (different protein digestion before the mass spec, and so on). But even at this level – which is more detailed than we’ve ever had for such compounds – there’s a lot to deal with here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you needed a reminder about just what a complicated mixing bowl we’re throwing our compounds into, here you go. The hope is that such techniques and the ungodly huge piles of data that they generate will help up build up a clearer picture of drug action.

Background &lt;p&gt;Research investigating Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) has largely focused on the cervical spine yet symptoms can be widespread. Thoracic spine pain prevalence is reported ~66%; perhaps unsurprising given the forceful stretch/eccentric loading of posterior structures of the spine, and the thoracic spine’s contribution to neck mobility/function. Approximately 50% WAD patients develop chronic pain and disability resulting in high levels of societal and healthcare costs. It is time to look beyond the cervical spine to fully understand anatomical dysfunction in WAD and provide new directions for clinical practice and research.&lt;/p&gt; Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the scope and nature of dysfunction in the thoracic region in patients with WAD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic review and data synthesis was conducted according to a pre-defined, registered (PROSPERO, CRD42015026983) and published protocol. All forms of observational study were included. A sensitive topic-based search strategy was designed from inception to 1/06/16. Databases, grey literature and registers were searched using a study population terms and key words derived from scoping search. Two reviewers independently searched information sources, assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third reviewer checked for consistency and clarity. Extracted data included summary data: sample size and characteristics, outcomes, and timescales to reflect disorder state. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were tabulated to allow enabling a semi-qualitative comparison and grouped by outcome across studies. Strength of the overall body of evidence was assessed using a modified GRADE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty eight studies (n&gt;50,000) which were conducted across a range of countries were included. Few authors responded to requests for further data (5 of 9 contacted). Results were reported in the context of overall quality and were presented for measures of pain or dysfunction and presented, where possible, according to WAD severity and time point post injury. Key findings include: 1) high prevalence of thoracic pain (&gt;60%); higher for those with more severe presentations and in the acute stage, 2) low prevalence of chest pain (&amp;lt;22%), 3) evidence of thoracic outlet syndrome, with some association to and involvement of the brachial plexus, 4) muscle dysfunction in the form of heightened activity of the sternocleidomastoid or delayed onset of action of the serratus anterior, 5) high prevalence of myofascial pain and trigger points in the scalene muscles, sternocleidomastoid and mid/lower fibres of trapezius muscle (48–65%), and 6) inconclusive evidence of altered thoracic posture or mobility.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence supports thoracic pain and dysfunction in patients with WAD, involving primarily nerves and muscles. Notwithstanding the low/very low level of evidence from this review, our findings do support a more extensive clinical evaluation of patients presenting with WAD. Additional high quality research is required to further characterise dysfunction across other structures in the thoracic region, including but not limited to the thoracic spine (mobility and posture) and thoracic muscles (stiffness, activation patterns). In turn this may inform the design of clinical trials targeting such dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicola R.

We sought to identify biomarkers which delineated individual hypertrophic responses to resistance training. Untrained, college-aged males engaged in full-body resistance training (3 d/wk) for 12 weeks. Body composition via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL) thickness via ultrasound, blood, VL muscle biopsies, and three-repetition maximum (3-RM) squat strength were obtained prior to (PRE) and following (POST) 12 weeks of training. K-means cluster analysis based on VL thickness changes identified LOW [n = 17; change (mean±SD) = +0.11±0.14 cm], modest (MOD; n = 29, +0.40±0.06 cm), and high (HI; n = 21, +0.69±0.14 cm) responders. Biomarkers related to histology, ribosome biogenesis, proteolysis, inflammation, and androgen signaling were analyzed between clusters. There were main effects of time (POST&gt;PRE, p&amp;lt;0.05) but no cluster×time interactions for increases in DXA lean body mass, type I and II muscle fiber cross sectional area and myonuclear number, satellite cell number, and macronutrients consumed. Interestingly, PRE VL thickness was ~12% greater in LOW versus HI (p = 0.021), despite POST values being ~12% greater in HI versus LOW (p = 0.006). However there was only a weak correlation between PRE VL thickness scores and change in VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.114, p = 0.005). Forced post hoc analysis indicated that muscle total RNA levels (i.e., ribosome density) did not significantly increase in the LOW cluster (351±70 ng/mg to 380±62, p = 0.253), but increased in the MOD (369±115 to 429±92, p = 0.009) and HI clusters (356±77 to 470±134, p&amp;lt;0.001; POST HI&gt;POST LOW, p = 0.013). Nonetheless, there was only a weak association between change in muscle total RNA and VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.079, p = 0.026). IL-1β mRNA levels decreased in the MOD and HI clusters following training (p&amp;lt;0.05), although associations between this marker and VL thickness changes were not significant (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0002, p = 0.919). In conclusion, individuals with lower pre-training VL thickness values and greater increases muscle total RNA levels following 12 weeks of resistance training experienced greater VL muscle growth, although these biomarkers individually explained only ~8–11% of the variance in hypertrophy.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher B.

K-means cluster analysis based on VL thickness changes identified LOW [n = 17; change (mean±SD) = +0.11±0.14 cm], modest (MOD; n = 29, +0.40±0.06 cm), and high (HI; n = 21, +0.69±0.14 cm) responders. Biomarkers related to histology, ribosome biogenesis, proteolysis, inflammation, and androgen signaling were analyzed between clusters. There were main effects of time (POST&gt;PRE, p&amp;lt;0.05) but no cluster×time interactions for increases in DXA lean body mass, type I and II muscle fiber cross sectional area and myonuclear number, satellite cell number, and macronutrients consumed. Interestingly, PRE VL thickness was ~12% greater in LOW versus HI (p = 0.021), despite POST values being ~12% greater in HI versus LOW (p = 0.006). However there was only a weak correlation between PRE VL thickness scores and change in VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.114, p = 0.005). Forced post hoc analysis indicated that muscle total RNA levels (i.e., ribosome density) did not significantly increase in the LOW cluster (351±70 ng/mg to 380±62, p = 0.253), but increased in the MOD (369±115 to 429±92, p = 0.009) and HI clusters (356±77 to 470±134, p&amp;lt;0.001; POST HI&gt;POST LOW, p = 0.013). Nonetheless, there was only a weak association between change in muscle total RNA and VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.079, p = 0.026). IL-1β mRNA levels decreased in the MOD and HI clusters following training (p&amp;lt;0.05), although associations between this marker and VL thickness changes were not significant (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0002, p = 0.919). In conclusion, individuals with lower pre-training VL thickness values and greater increases muscle total RNA levels following 12 weeks of resistance training experienced greater VL muscle growth, although these biomarkers individually explained only ~8–11% of the variance in hypertrophy.</content></content></item><item><published>1523394000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195720</canonicalUrl><updated>1523394000000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195720</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c1:9aea0a7d</id><title>Genetic modification of &amp;lt;i&gt;Anopheles stephensi&amp;lt;/i&gt; for resistance to multiple &amp;lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&amp;lt;/i&gt; strains does not influence susceptibility to o’nyong’nyong virus or insecticides, or Wolbachia-mediated resistance to the malaria parasite</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195720</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>f136f31c</fingerprint><author><name>Andrew Pike</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195720</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Pike, George Dimopoulos&lt;/p&gt;
Mosquitoes that have been genetically engineered for resistance to human pathogens are a potential new tool for controlling vector-borne disease. However, genetic modification may have unintended off-target effects that could affect the mosquitoes’ utility for disease control. We measured the resistance of five genetically modified &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt;-suppressing &lt;i&gt;Anopheles stephensi&lt;/i&gt; lines to o’nyong’nyong virus, four classes of insecticides, and diverse &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; field isolates and characterized the interactions between our genetic modifications and infection with the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;. The genetic modifications did not alter the mosquitoes’ resistance to either o’nyong’nyong virus or insecticides, and the mosquitoes were equally resistant to all tested &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; strains, regardless of &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; infection status. These results indicate that mosquitoes can be genetically modified for resistance to malaria parasite infection and remain compatible with other vector-control measures without becoming better vectors for other pathogens.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Pike, George Dimopoulos&lt;/p&gt;

Spawning ground of Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) is located near the West Mariana Ridge seamount. The species travels through the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and then enters the Kuroshio Current (KC) on the migration toward East Asian growth habitats. Therefore, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events serve as the potentially important drivers of interannual variability across the equatorial Pacific. Because the NEC bifurcation and salinity profiles are related to ENSO events, we investigated the influence of locations of the NEC bifurcation and salinity front on the success of larval entry to the KC by numerically modeling particle transport in ocean currents from 1972 to 2013 and possible effects on the size of glass eels at continental recruitment and, via otolithometry on the duration of larval migration. Circulation and hydrography used for particle tracking were obtained from the results of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) high-resolution forecasting experiment. Our results demonstrated that during El Niño years, (1) the southward movement of the salinity front might cause the larvae to experience slower currents and (2) the northward movement of the NEC bifurcation might broaden the separation between their spawning ground and NEC bifurcation, thus prolonging the time needed for the larvae to enter the KC from their spawning ground, because of which the duration of entrainment in the water column and body size increase when eels reach estuarine waters. In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Mei Hsiung, Shingo Kimura, Yu-San Han, Aigo Takeshige, Yoshiyuki Iizuka&lt;/p&gt;

Current rates of species loss triggered numerous attempts to protect and conserve biodiversity. Species conservation, however, requires species identification skills, a competence obtained through intensive training and experience. Field researchers, land managers, educators, civil servants, and the interested public would greatly benefit from accessible, up-to-date tools automating the process of species identification. Currently, relevant technologies, such as digital cameras, mobile devices, and remote access to databases, are ubiquitously available, accompanied by significant advances in image processing and pattern recognition. The idea of automated species identification is approaching reality. We review the technical status quo on computer vision approaches for plant species identification, highlight the main research challenges to overcome in providing applicable tools, and conclude with a discussion of open and future research thrusts.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bfmDpVYKmqI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jana Wäldchen, Michael Rzanny, Marco Seeland, Patrick Mäder&lt;/p&gt;

Microbes usually exist in communities consisting of myriad different but interacting species. These interactions are typically mediated through environmental modifications; microbes change the environment by taking up resources and excreting metabolites, which affects the growth of both themselves and also other microbes. We show here that the way microbes modify their environment and react to it sets the interactions within single-species populations and also between different species. A very common environmental modification is a change of the environmental pH. We find experimentally that these pH changes create feedback loops that can determine the fate of bacterial populations; they can either facilitate or inhibit growth, and in extreme cases will cause extinction of the bacterial population. Understanding how single species change the pH and react to these changes allowed us to estimate their pairwise interaction outcomes. Those interactions lead to a set of generic interaction motifs—bistability, successive growth, extended suicide, and stabilization—that may be independent of which environmental parameter is modified and thus may reoccur in different microbial systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/64piOgqCVHQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christoph Ratzke, Jeff Gore&lt;/p&gt;

Those interactions lead to a set of generic interaction motifs—bistability, successive growth, extended suicide, and stabilization—that may be independent of which environmental parameter is modified and thus may reoccur in different microbial systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/64piOgqCVHQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/64piOgqCVHQ/article</href></item></alternate></item><item><published>1521097200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-03502-7/MediaObjects/41467_2018_3502_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>417</height><width>685</width></visual><unread>False</unread><title>Voltage gating of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels</title><engagement>111</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03502-7</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16229332b32:98b631:7d6c1c1c</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03502-7</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/o8hRSRPUbKc/s41467-018-03502-7</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>fdbdecb5</fingerprint><author><name>Mirko Moroni</name></author><crawled>1521109642034</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03502-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Voltage gating of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voltage gating of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03502-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03502-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;PIEZO proteins form mechanosensitive ion channels.

Although personality traits can largely affect individual fitness we know little about the evolutionary forces generating and maintaining personality variation. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that personality variation in aggression is sexually selected in the monogamous, bi-parental cichlid &lt;i&gt;Pelvicachromis pulcher&lt;/i&gt;. In this species, breeding pairs form territories and they aggressively defend their territory and offspring against con- and heterospecific intruders. In our mate choice study, we followed up two alternative hypotheses. We either expected females to show a directional preference for a high level and high consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for male parental quality). Alternatively, we expected females to choose males for (dis-)similarity in the level/consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for compatibility). Individual level and consistency of aggression were assessed for males and females using mirror tests. After eavesdropping on aggressive behaviour of two males (differing in level and consistency of aggression) females were then allowed to choose between the two males. Males, but not females, showed personality variation in aggression. Further, females generally preferred consistent over inconsistent males independent of their level of aggression. We did not detect a general preference for the level of male aggression. However, we found an above average preference for consistent high-aggression males; whereas female preference for inconsistent high-aggression did not deviate from random choice. Our results suggest behavioural consistency of aggression in male rainbow kribs is selected for via female mate choice. Further, our study underlines the importance of considering both the level and the consistency of a behavioural trait in studies of animal behaviour.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ulrike Scherer, Mira Kuhnhardt, Wiebke Schuett&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Qualitative studies indicated that cancer survivors may be worried about finding a partner in the future, but whether this concern is warranted is unknown. We examined single people´s interest in dating a cancer survivor, how they perceive survivors’ traits, and their preferences about the timing of disclosing a cancer history.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In three experimental vignette studies, dating website members (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 324) and college students (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 138 and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 131) were randomly assigned to a vignette of a person with or without a history of cancer (experiment 1 &amp;amp; 2), or a cancer survivor beyond or during active follow-up (experiment 3). Respondents rated their interest in dating this fictive person, this person’s traits, and indicated their preferences about the timing of disclosure. ANOVAs with main and interaction effects of condition, gender, and relationship history were conducted, partial eta squared and Cohen’s &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; were used to estimate the magnitude of effects. Correlations were used to investigate relationships between interest in a date and assessment of traits.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors’ traits were assessed more positively, but interest to date them did not differ from healthy vignettes for both men and women. However, widowed respondents were much less interested in a date with a cancer survivor, and women showed less interest in a cancer survivor during active follow-up relative to survivors beyond follow-up. Most respondents wanted to hear about the cancer diagnosis after a few dates, hardly anyone wanted to hear about this before the first date (2% - 5%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion and implications for cancer survivors &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors do not have to expect any more problems in finding a date than people without a cancer history, and can wait a few dates before disclosing.

Survivors dating widowed people and survivors in active follow-up could expect more hesitant reactions and should disclose earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521010800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-22713-y/MediaObjects/41598_2018_22713_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>453</height><width>685</width></visual><unread>False</unread><title>The voltage-gated sodium channel EF-hands form an interaction with the III-IV linker that is disturbed by disease-causing mutations</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22713-y</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1622405f13b:1d0d9b:34f43e70</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22713-y</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/-vy3O_95zoo/s41598-018-22713-y</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>b85e26fa</fingerprint><author><name>Bernd R.

In 2013, a large measles epidemic occurred in the Aketi Health Zone of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We conducted a two-stage, retrospective cluster survey to estimate the attack rate, the case fatality rate, and the measles-specific mortality rate during the epidemic. 1424 households containing 7880 individuals were included. The estimated attack rate was 14.0%, (35.0% among children aged &amp;lt;5years). The estimated case fatality rate was 4.2% (6.1% among children aged &amp;lt;5years). Spatial analysis and linear regression showed that younger children, those who did not receive care, and those living farther away from Aketi Hospital early in the epidemic had a higher risk of measles related death. Vaccination coverage prior to the outbreak was low (76%), and a delayed reactive vaccination campaign contributed to the high attack rate. We provide evidences suggesting that a comprehensive case management approach reduced measles fatality during this epidemic in rural, inaccessible resource-poor setting.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Etienne Gignoux, Jonathan Polonsky, Iza Ciglenecki, Mathieu Bichet, Matthew Coldiron, Enoch Thuambe Lwiyo, Innocent Akonda, Micaela Serafini, Klaudia Porten&lt;/p&gt;
In 2013, a large measles epidemic occurred in the Aketi Health Zone of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We conducted a two-stage, retrospective cluster survey to estimate the attack rate, the case fatality rate, and the measles-specific mortality rate during the epidemic. 1424 households containing 7880 individuals were included. The estimated attack rate was 14.0%, (35.0% among children aged &amp;lt;5years). The estimated case fatality rate was 4.2% (6.1% among children aged &amp;lt;5years). Spatial analysis and linear regression showed that younger children, those who did not receive care, and those living farther away from Aketi Hospital early in the epidemic had a higher risk of measles related death. Vaccination coverage prior to the outbreak was low (76%), and a delayed reactive vaccination campaign contributed to the high attack rate. We provide evidences suggesting that a comprehensive case management approach reduced measles fatality during this epidemic in rural, inaccessible resource-poor setting.</content></content></item><item><published>1521691200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01127/20180322/images/medium/jp-2018-01127d_0006.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>399</height><width>500</width></visual><unread>False</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01127/20180322/images/medium/jp-2018-01127d_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01127&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

With unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), most of the sequencing errors can be corrected. However, errors before UMI tagging, such as DNA polymerase errors during end-repair and the first PCR cycle, cannot be corrected with single-strand UMIs and impose fundamental limits to UMI-based variant calling. We developed smCounter2, a UMI-based variant caller for targeted sequencing data and an upgrade from the current version of smCounter. Compared to smCounter, smCounter2 features lower detection limit at 0.5%, better overall accuracy (particularly in non-coding regions), a consistent threshold that can be applied to both deep and shallow sequencing runs, and easier use via a Docker image and code for read pre-processing. We benchmarked smCounter2 against several state-of-the-art UMI-based variant calling methods using multiple datasets and demonstrated smCounter2&apos;s superior performance in detecting somatic variants. At the core of smCounter2 is a statistical test to determine whether the allele frequency of the putative variant is significantly above the background error rate, which was carefully modeled using an independent dataset. The improved accuracy in non-coding regions was mainly achieved using novel repetitive region filters that were specifically designed for UMI data.

Autophagy plays a crucial role in health and disease, regulating central cellular processes such as adaptive stress responses, differentiation, tissue development, and homeostasis. However, the role of autophagy in human physiology is poorly understood, highlighting a need for a model human organ system to assess the efficacy and safety of strategies to therapeutically modulate autophagy. As a complete, cyclically remodelled (mini-)organ, the organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs), which, after massive growth (anagen), spontaneously enter into an apoptosis-driven organ involution (catagen) process, may provide such a model. Here, we reveal that in anagen, hair matrix keratinocytes (MKs) of organ-cultured HFs exhibit an active autophagic flux, as documented by evaluation of endogenous lipidated Light Chain 3B (LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) proteins and the ultrastructural visualization of autophagosomes at all stages of the autophagy process. This autophagic flux is altered during catagen, and genetic inhibition of autophagy promotes catagen development. Conversely, an anti–hair loss product markedly enhances intrafollicular autophagy, leading to anagen prolongation. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role of autophagy in human hair growth. Moreover, we show that organ-cultured scalp HFs are an excellent preclinical research model for exploring the role of autophagy in human tissue physiology and for evaluating the efficacy and tissue toxicity of candidate autophagy-modulatory agents in a living human (mini-)organ.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VVncDRle7Ww&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chiara Parodi, Jonathan A.

Hypovitaminosis D has been extensively documented in critically ill humans. However, whether or not critically ill dogs have alterations in vitamin D concentrations remains unconfirmed. The primary aims of our study were to compare serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D] concentrations in critically ill dogs with healthy control dogs, determine the prognostic utility of serum 25(OH)D concentration as a biomarker in critically ill dogs, and to assess if serum 25(OH)D concentrations in critically ill dogs are associated with length of stay in the intensive care unit or illness severity. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D together with a range of other clinical, biochemical, and hematological parameters, were measured in 99 dogs within 24 hours of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Critically ill dogs (P = 0.001) and dogs with sepsis (P = 0.002) had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy control dogs. In addition, serum 25(OH)D concentration was an independent predictor of in-hospital and 30 day survival. Using a cut-off of 33 ng/mL, serum 25(OH)D concentrations had excellent sensitivity (0.94; 95% CI, 0.71–1.00), but poor specificity (0.41; 95% CI, 0.31–0.53) for detection of survival. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLE) fast score but were not associated with ICU length of stay. Hospitalized dogs with critical illness have decreased serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy dogs and can be used to predict survival in this cohort.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jared A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a highly sensitive test for TB diagnosis, but still costly to most low-income countries. Several implementation strategies instead of frontline have been suggested; however with scarce data. We assessed accuracy of different Xpert MTB/RIF implementation strategies to inform national roll-out.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study of 1,924 adult presumptive TB patients in five regional referral hospitals of Uganda. Two sputum samples were collected, one for fluorescent microscopy (FM) and Xpert MTB/RIF examined at the study site laboratories. The second sample was sent to the Uganda Supra National TB reference laboratory for culture using both Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) and liquid culture (MGIT). We compared the sensitivities of FM, Xpert MTB/RIF and the incremental sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF among patients negative on FM using LJ and/or MGIT as a reference standard.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total 1924 patients were enrolled of which 1596 (83%) patients had at least one laboratory result and 1083 respondents had a complete set of all the laboratory results. A total of 328 (30%) were TB positive on LJ and /or MGIT culture. The sensitivity of FM was n (%; 95% confidence interval) 246 (63.5%; 57.9–68.7) overall compared to 52 (55.4%; 44.1–66.3) among HIV positive individuals, while the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 300 (76.2%; 71.7–80.7) and 69 (71.6%; 60.5–81.1) overall and among HIV positive individuals respectively. Overall incremental sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 60 (36.5%; 27.7–46.0) and 20 (41.7%; 25.5–59.2) among HIV positive individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Xpert MTB/RIF has a higher sensitivity than FM both in general population and HIV positive population. Xpert MTB/RIF offers a significant increase in terms of diagnostic sensitivity even when it is deployed selectively i.e. among smear negative presumptive TB patients. Our results support frontline use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in high HIV/TB prevalent countries. In settings with limited access, mechanisms to refer smear negative sputum samples to Xpert MTB/RIF hubs are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Winters Muttamba, Willy Ssengooba, Rogers Sekibira, Bruce Kirenga, Achilles Katamba, Moses Joloba&lt;/p&gt;

Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters inside a living cell will lead to major advances in our understanding of biology and complex diseases, such as cancer. It also enables the development of new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. Progress in nanofabrication and wireless communication has opened up the potential of making a wireless chip small enough that it can be wholly inserted into a living cell. To investigate how such chips could be internalized into various types of living single cells and how this process might affect cells’ physiology, we designed and fabricated a series of multilayered micron-scale tag structures with different sizes as potential RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) cell trackers. While the present structures are test structures that do not resonate, the tags that do resonate have similar structure from device fabrication, material properties, and device size point of view.

Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters inside a living cell will lead to major advances in our understanding of biology and complex diseases, such as cancer. It also enables the development of new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. Progress in nanofabrication and wireless communication has opened up the potential of making a wireless chip small enough that it can be wholly inserted into a living cell. To investigate how such chips could be internalized into various types of living single cells and how this process might affect cells’ physiology, we designed and fabricated a series of multilayered micron-scale tag structures with different sizes as potential RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) cell trackers. While the present structures are test structures that do not resonate, the tags that do resonate have similar structure from device fabrication, material properties, and device size point of view. The structures are in four different sizes, the largest with the lateral dimension of 9 μm × 21 μm. The thickness for these structures is kept constant at 1.5 μm. We demonstrate successful delivery of our fabricated chips into various types of living cells, such as melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer and healthy/normal fibroblast skin cells. To our surprise, we observed a remarkable internalization rate difference between each cell type; the uptake rate was faster for more aggressive cancer cells than the normal/healthy cells. Cell viability before and after tag cellular internalization and persistence of the internalized tags have also been recorded over the course of five days of incubation. These results establish the foundations of the possibility of long term, wireless, intracellular physiological signal monitoring.</content></content></item><item><published>1522047600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>TRIM11 activates the proteasome and promotes overall protein degradation by regulating USP14</title><engagement>3</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03499-z</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16261a10c4d:5957e5c:9f3b30f2</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03499-z</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/geFSfaPGz5I/s41467-018-03499-z</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ea46eb09</fingerprint><author><name>Liang Chen</name></author><crawled>1522056367181</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03499-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TRIM11 activates the proteasome and promotes overall protein degradation by regulating USP14&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRIM11 activates the proteasome and promotes overall protein degradation by regulating USP14, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03499-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03499-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The proteasome-bound ubiquitinase USP14 plays an important role in determining proteasome activity and substrate specificity.

&lt;i&gt;Salvia verbenaca&lt;/i&gt; (wild sage) is a commonly cultivated herbal medicine plant, which is native to the Mediterranean climate regions of Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. However, it has become an invasive species in semi-arid and arid regions of southern Australia. Two varieties are present in this region, var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt; and var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt;, each of which can be distinguished by differences in morphology and flowering period. Following trials to determine the optimum temperate regime for germination and response to light and dark, seeds of both varieties were tested for their response to variations in pH, moisture stress, salinity, and burial depth. The temperature and light trial was carried out using three different temperature regimes; 30/20°C, 25/15°C and 20/12°C, and two light regimes; 12 hours light/12 hours dark and 24 hours dark, with var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; responding to relatively higher temperatures than var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt;. The germination rate of neither species was significantly inhibited by complete darkness when compared to rates under periodic light exposure. Both varieties germinated at near optimum rates strongly to very strongly in all pH buffer solutions, from pH 5 to pH 10, but they responded most strongly at neutral pH. Var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; showed slightly more tolerance to reduced moisture availability, moderate to strong salinity, and burial depth, compared to var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt;. However, even a fairly shallow burial depth of 2 cm completely inhibited germination of both varieties. Thus, in circumstances where both varieties are present in a soil seedbank, var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; could be expected to establish in more challenging conditions, where moisture is limited and salinity is ‘moderate to high’, implying that it is a more serious threat for invasive weed in conditions where crop plants are already challenged.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Mansoor Javaid, Singarayer Florentine, Hafiz Haider Ali, Sandra Weller&lt;/p&gt;

Fungal spores and mycelium fragments are particles which become and remain airborne and have been subjects of aerobiological studies.

Because many fungi produce mycotoxins and both their mycelium fragments and spores are potential allergens, monitoring the presence of these taxa is of key importance. So far data on exposure and sensitization to fungal allergens are mainly based on the assessment of few, easily identifiable taxa and focused only on certain environments. The microscopic method used to analyze aerobiological samples and the inconspicuous fungal characters do not allow a in depth taxonomical identification. Here, we present a first assessment of fungal diversity from airborne samples using a DNA metabarcoding analysis. The nuclear ITS2 region was selected as barcode to catch fungal diversity in mixed airborne samples gathered during two weeks in four sites of North-Eastern and Central Italy. We assessed the taxonomic composition and diversity within and among the sampled sites and compared the molecular data with those obtained by traditional microscopy. The molecular analyses provide a tenfold more comprehensive determination of the taxa than the traditional morphological inspections.

The laboratory and bioinformatic workflow implemented here is now suitable for routine, high-throughput, regional analyses of airborne fungi.</content></content></item><item><published>1521172841000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Double photoionization of propylene oxide: A coincidence study of the ejection of a pair of valence-shell electrons</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024408?af=R</originId><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1625704c351:4c87b7b:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024408?af=R</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>d842ae11</fingerprint><author><name>Stefano Falcinelli</name></author><crawled>1521878352721</crawled><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024408?af=R</link><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/11&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 11&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1523554635000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>The future of artisanal fishing</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/161?rss=1</originId><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fecea1:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/161.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/161?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>b8f66352</fingerprint><author><name>Pauly, D.</name></author><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/161?rss=1</link><keywords><item>Oceanography</item></keywords></item><item><published>1522789200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195350</canonicalUrl><updated>1522789200000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195350</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6b:34f43e70</id><title>Reducing inherent biases introduced during DNA viral metagenome analyses of municipal wastewater</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195350</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>433d97fb</fingerprint><author><name>Nichole E.

Metagenomics is a powerful tool for characterizing viral composition within environmental samples, but sample and molecular processing steps can bias the estimation of viral community structure. The objective of this study is to understand the inherent variability introduced when conducting viral metagenomic analyses of wastewater and provide a bioinformatic strategy to accurately analyze sequences for viral community analyses. A standard approach using a combination of ultrafiltration, membrane filtration, and DNase treatment, and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) produced DNA preparations without any bacterial derived genes. Results showed recoveries in wastewater matrix ranged between 60–100%. A bias towards small single stranded DNA (ssDNA; polyomavirus) virus types vs larger double stranded DNA (dsDNA; adenovirus) viruses was also observed with a total estimated recovery of small circular viruses to be as much as 173-fold higher. Notably, ssDNA abundance decreased with sample dilution while large dsDNA genomes (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Caudovirales&lt;/i&gt;) initially increased in abundance with dilution before gradually decreasing with further dilution in wastewater samples. The present study revealed the inherent biases associated with different components of viral metagenomic methods applied to wastewater. Overall, these results provide a well-characterized approach for effectively conducting viral metagenomics analysis of wastewater and reveal that dilution can effectively mitigate MDA bias.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nichole E.

Powdery mildew is a widespread fungal plant disease that can cause significant losses in many crops. Some &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; genes (&lt;i&gt;Mildew resistance locus O&lt;/i&gt;) have proved to confer a durable resistance to powdery mildew in several species. Resistance granted by the &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; gene family members has prompted an increasing interest in characterizing these genes and implementing their use in plant breeding. Lentil (&lt;i&gt;Lens culinaris&lt;/i&gt; Medik.) is a widely grown food legume almost exclusively consumed as dry seed with an average world production of 4.5 million tons. Powdery mildew causes severe losses on certain lentil cultivars under particular environmental conditions. Data mining of the lentil CDC Redberry draft genome allowed to identify up to 15 gene sequences with homology to known &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; genes, designated as &lt;i&gt;LcMLOs&lt;/i&gt;. Further characterization of these gene sequences and their deduced protein sequences demonstrated conformity with key MLO protein characteristics such as the presence of transmembrane and calmodulin binding domains, as well as that of other conserved motifs. Phylogenetic and other comparative analyses revealed that &lt;i&gt;LcMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LcMLO3&lt;/i&gt; are the most likely gene orthologs related to powdery mildew response in other species, sharing a high similarity with other known resistance genes of dicot species, such as pea &lt;i&gt;PsMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula MtMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MtMLO3&lt;/i&gt;. Sets of primers were designed as tools to PCR amplify the genomic sequences of &lt;i&gt;LcMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LcMLO3&lt;/i&gt;, also to screen lentil germplasm in search of resistance mutants. Primers were used to obtain the complete sequences of these two genes in all of the six wild lentil relatives. Respective to each gene, all &lt;i&gt;Lens&lt;/i&gt; sequences shared a high similarity. Likewise, we used these primers to screen a working collection of 58 cultivated and 23 wild lentil accessions in search of length polymorphisms present in these two genes. All these data widen the insights on this gene family and can be useful for breeding programs in lentil and close related species.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Polanco, Luis E.

The posterior auricular muscle (PAM) reflex to sounds has been used clinically to determine hearing threshold as an alternative to other audiological diagnostic measures such as the auditory brainstem response. We have shown that the PAM response is also sensitive to interaural timing differences in normally hearing adults. PAM responses were evoked by both ipsilateral/ contralateral monaural stimulation and by binaural stimulation. Introducing sound delays ipsilaterally or contralaterally decreased the PAM response amplitude and increased its latency. The PAM response in this study shows a qualitatively similar pattern to that seen by the binaural interaction component (BIC) of the auditory brainstem potential to binaural clicks described in previous studies, in that both: have their shortest latency and maximal amplitudes centred around zero interaural timing differences, have response latencies increase with increasing interaural delays up to 1.2 ms and have response amplitudes decrease with increasing interaural delays of up to 1.2 ms. Our data show that the PAM response may be useful in measuring binaural integration in humans non-invasively for diagnostic or research studies.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by T.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia, developmental delay, incomplete sexual development, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a variety of challenging behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The characteristics of PWS can be difficult for caregivers to cope with and are likely to cause significant and long- term caregiver burden. The current study examined burden in 142 caregivers of children and adults with PWS living in the US using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The study aimed to measure the level of burden in caregivers of individuals with PWS, to explore the impact of PWS on caregiver quality of life, and to assess ZBI as an indicator of that impact.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Caregivers participating in this study were predominantly mothers, 30–59 years old, non-Hispanic Whites, married or in a relationship, with an annual household income slightly distributed towards higher income. Nearly 90% of the caregiver`s children with PWS lived at home. Caregivers experienced high caregiver burden with an average ZBI score of 44.4 ± 15.4. ZBI scores were highest for caregivers of teenage and young adult individuals with PWS (49.2 ± 14.6 and 49.2 ± 14.1, respectively), while those caring for older adults (&gt;30) and the youngest age group had lower scores (38.6 ±10.5 and 34.8 ±12.5, respectively). Caregivers reported that caring for a person with PWS negatively impacted their romantic relationship, ability to work, sleep, and mood. Whereas we did not find strong correlations between family income or level of help the caregiver receives and ZBI scores, the results showed significant correlations and a linear relationship between ZBI scores and caregiver depressed mood, feelings of anxiety, negative romantic relationship impact, as well as sleep and work disruption.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study reveals that PWS incurs high caregiver burden and impacts many aspects of the lives of caregiver.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia, developmental delay, incomplete sexual development, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a variety of challenging behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The characteristics of PWS can be difficult for caregivers to cope with and are likely to cause significant and long- term caregiver burden. The current study examined burden in 142 caregivers of children and adults with PWS living in the US using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The study aimed to measure the level of burden in caregivers of individuals with PWS, to explore the impact of PWS on caregiver quality of life, and to assess ZBI as an indicator of that impact.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Caregivers participating in this study were predominantly mothers, 30–59 years old, non-Hispanic Whites, married or in a relationship, with an annual household income slightly distributed towards higher income. Nearly 90% of the caregiver`s children with PWS lived at home. Caregivers experienced high caregiver burden with an average ZBI score of 44.4 ± 15.4. ZBI scores were highest for caregivers of teenage and young adult individuals with PWS (49.2 ± 14.6 and 49.2 ± 14.1, respectively), while those caring for older adults (&gt;30) and the youngest age group had lower scores (38.6 ±10.5 and 34.8 ±12.5, respectively). Caregivers reported that caring for a person with PWS negatively impacted their romantic relationship, ability to work, sleep, and mood. Whereas we did not find strong correlations between family income or level of help the caregiver receives and ZBI scores, the results showed significant correlations and a linear relationship between ZBI scores and caregiver depressed mood, feelings of anxiety, negative romantic relationship impact, as well as sleep and work disruption.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study reveals that PWS incurs high caregiver burden and impacts many aspects of the lives of caregiver. We identified the ZBI as a good predictor of that impact. Our findings draw attention to the critical unmet need for support for caregivers of individuals with PWS.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521442800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><unread>False</unread><title>Copper-surface-mediated synthesis of acetylenic carbon-rich nanofibers for active metal-free photocathodes</title><engagement>38</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03444-0</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16240323431:2a0aff8:9f3b30f2</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03444-0</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/4Mn2C7Y0rdY/s41467-018-03444-0</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>1c4f8392</fingerprint><author><name>Tao Zhang</name></author><crawled>1521495454769</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03444-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copper-surface-mediated synthesis of acetylenic carbon-rich nanofibers for active metal-free photocathodes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copper-surface-mediated synthesis of acetylenic carbon-rich nanofibers for active metal-free photocathodes, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03444-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03444-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;While photoelectrochemical devices combine light-absorption with fuel and electricity generation, their implementation is hampered by high costs and low output.

Humans employ various control strategies to initiate and maintain bodily movement. In case that the normal gait function is impaired, exoskeleton robots provide motor assistance during therapy. While the robotic control system builds on kinematic gait functions, the patient’s voluntary efforts to initiate motion also contribute to the effectiveness of the therapy process. However, it is currently not well understood how voluntary initiation as a subjective capacity affects the physiological level of motor control. In order to understand the functional nexus between voluntary initiation and motor control, we interviewed patients undergoing robotic gait rehabilitation with the HAL exoskeleton robot about their experience and command of voluntarily initiating forward gait while using the HAL system. Their reports provide phenomenal evidence for voluntary initiation as a distinct cognitive act that comes as phenomenal performance. Furthermore, phenomenal evidence about the functional relation of intention and initiation correlates with FIM-M gait scores. Based on the assumption that HAL reduces control-related difficulties of voluntarily initiating joint movement, we identified two cognitive control strategies, shaping and compensation of gait, that imply a heterarchic organization of the human system of action control.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Patrick Grüneberg, Hideki Kadone, Naomi Kuramoto, Tomoyuki Ueno, Yasushi Hada, Masashi Yamazaki, Yoshiyuki Sankai, Kenji Suzuki&lt;/p&gt;

The peregrine falcon &lt;i&gt;Falco peregrinus&lt;/i&gt; is renowned for attacking its prey from high altitude in a fast controlled dive called a stoop. Many other raptors employ a similar mode of attack, but the functional benefits of stooping remain obscure. Here we investigate whether, when, and why stooping promotes catch success, using a three-dimensional, agent-based modeling approach to simulate attacks of falcons on aerial prey. We simulate avian flapping and gliding flight using an analytical quasi-steady model of the aerodynamic forces and moments, parametrized by empirical measurements of flight morphology. The model-birds’ flight control inputs are commanded by their guidance system, comprising a phenomenological model of its vision, guidance, and control. To intercept its prey, model-falcons use the same guidance law as missiles (pure proportional navigation); this assumption is corroborated by empirical data on peregrine falcons hunting lures. We parametrically vary the falcon’s starting position relative to its prey, together with the feedback gain of its guidance loop, under differing assumptions regarding its errors and delay in vision and control, and for three different patterns of prey motion. We find that, when the prey maneuvers erratically, high-altitude stoops increase catch success compared to low-altitude attacks, but only if the falcon’s guidance law is appropriately tuned, and only given a high degree of precision in vision and control. Remarkably, the optimal tuning of the guidance law in our simulations coincides closely with what has been observed empirically in peregrines. High-altitude stoops are shown to be beneficial because their high airspeed enables production of higher aerodynamic forces for maneuvering, and facilitates higher roll agility as the wings are tucked, each of which is essential to catching maneuvering prey at realistic response delays.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ypEvewr7kSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robin Mills, Hanno Hildenbrandt, Graham K.

The signaling scaffold protein GIT1 is expressed widely throughout the brain, but its function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains elusive. Mice lacking GIT1 have been proposed as a model for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, due to alterations in basal locomotor activity as well as paradoxical locomotor suppression by the psychostimulant amphetamine. Since we had previously shown that GIT1-knockout mice have normal locomotor activity, here we examined GIT1-deficient mice for ADHD-like behavior in more detail, and find neither hyperactivity nor amphetamine-induced locomotor suppression. Instead, GIT1-deficient mice exhibit profound learning and memory defects and reduced synaptic structural plasticity, consistent with an intellectual disability phenotype. We conclude that loss of GIT1 alone is insufficient to drive a robust ADHD phenotype in distinct strains of mice. In contrast, multiple learning and memory defects have been observed here and in other studies using distinct GIT1-knockout lines, consistent with a predominant intellectual disability phenotype related to altered synaptic structural plasticity.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Amanda C.

In contrast, multiple learning and memory defects have been observed here and in other studies using distinct GIT1-knockout lines, consistent with a predominant intellectual disability phenotype related to altered synaptic structural plasticity.</content></content></item><item><published>1522168914000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/13.cover-source.jpg?itok=zzqvvTgr</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>480</height><width>359</width></visual><unread>True</unread><title>The complex simplicity of the bacterial cytoskeleton [Biochemistry]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3205.short?rss=1</originId><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1626893ee0e:6352293:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3205</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3205.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>5fa0bdae</fingerprint><author><name>Felipe Merino, Stefan Raunser</name></author><crawled>1522172947982</crawled><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3205.short?rss=1</link><description>Proper segregation of genetic material is a universal requirement for all living organisms.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the number of studies that have tried to demonstrate that there is an association between previous falls and the fear of falling, the relationship between these two variables remains a matter of controversy.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our objective was to investigate whether the fear of falling is a cause of falls, a consequence, or both in community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 75 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A descriptive, longitudinal, prospective study was performed. A total of 640 individuals were interviewed between 2009 and 2011. Sociodemographic data, health status, history of falls and fear of falling were assessed at baseline and at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of falls at baseline was 25% as opposed to 35.2% at 24 months. The prevalence of the fear of falling was 41.5% at baseline. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between a history of falls and the fear of falling. Other factors associated with the fear of falling were female gender, comorbidity, depressive symptoms, and disability. In total, 41.7% of the subjects who had reported a fear of falling at baseline had suffered at least one fall 24 months later. Unadjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that the fear of falling was a risk factor for falls. According to the final model adjusted for other covariates, the only reliable predictor was female gender. The Cox model stratified by gender failed to show a crude association between fear of falling and falls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A previous history of falls in the previous year was a good predictor of the fear of falling; but the fear of falling was a predictor of falls during follow-up only in the unadjusted model, pointing to strong gender turns out as an effect modifier of the association of FOF and subsequent falls.

Background &lt;p&gt;Endurance swimming exercises coupled to disinfection by-products exposure has been associated with increased airways dysfunction and neurogenic inflammation in elite swimmers. However, the impact of swimming pool exposure at a recreational level on autonomic activity has never been explored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how swimming pool attendance is influencing lung and autonomic function in school-aged children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 858 children enrolled a cross sectional survey. Spirometry and airway reversibility to beta-2 agonist, skin-prick-tests and exhaled nitric oxide measurements were performed. Pupillometry was used to evaluate autonomic nervous function. Children were classified as current swimmers (CS), past swimmers (PS) and non-swimmers (NS), according to the amount of swimming practice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Current swimmers group had significantly lower maximum and average pupil constriction velocities when compared to both PS and NS groups (3.8 and 5.1 vs 3.9 and 5.3 vs 4.0 and 5.4 mm/s, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01, respectively). Moreover, affinity to the beta-2 agonist and levels of exhaled nitric oxide were significantly higher in CS when compared to NS (70 vs 60 mL and 12 vs 10 ppb, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03, respectively). A non-significant trend for a higher risk of asthma, atopic eczema and allergic rhinitis was found with more years of swimming practice, particularly in atopic individuals (β = 1.12, 1.40 and 1.31, respectively). After case-case analysis, it was possible to observe that results were not influenced by the inclusion of individuals with asthma.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Concluding, swimming pool attendance appears to be associated with autonomic changes and increased baseline airway smooth muscle constriction even in children without asthma.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by João Cavaleiro Rufo, Inês Paciência, Diana Silva, Carla Martins, Joana Madureira, Eduardo de Oliveira Fernandes, Patrícia Padrão, Pedro Moreira, Luís Delgado, André Moreira&lt;/p&gt;

The performance of DIA-NN demonstrates that deep learning provides opportunities to boost the analysis of data-independent acquisition workflows in proteomics.</content></content></item><item><published>1521442800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03442-8/d41586-018-03442-8_15530436.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><width>1024</width></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1623f9f9de9:291bd78:9f3b30f2</id><title>A galactic net for baby stars</title><engagement>105</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03442-8</originId><unread>False</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03442-8</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>491cb036</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1521485848041</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03442-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A galactic net for baby stars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A galactic net for baby stars, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03442-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03442-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stellar nurseries are entangled in extensive gas ropes.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A galactic net for baby stars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A galactic net for baby stars, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03442-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03442-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stellar nurseries are entangled in extensive gas ropes.</content></content></item><item><published>1521752400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195007</canonicalUrl><updated>1521752400000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195007</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34c6:34f43e70</id><title>A truncated PPAR gamma 2 localizes to mitochondria and regulates mitochondrial respiration in brown adipocytes</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195007</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>226260be</fingerprint><author><name>Ji Suk Chang</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195007</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Suk Chang, Kyoungsoo Ha&lt;/p&gt;
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a key regulator of brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis. The PPARγ gene produces two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. PPARγ2 is identical to PPARγ1 except for additional 30 amino acids present in the N-terminus of PPARγ2. Here we report that the C-terminally truncated form of PPARγ2 is predominantly present in the mitochondrial matrix of brown adipocytes and that it binds to the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which contains the promoter for mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) genes. Expression of mitochondrially targeted MLS-PPARγ2 in brown adipocytes increases mtDNA-encoded ETC gene expression concomitant with enhanced mitochondrial respiration. These results suggest that direct regulation of mitochondrially encoded ETC gene expression by mitochondrial PPARγ2, in part, underlies the isoform-specific role for PPARγ2 in brown adipocytes.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Suk Chang, Kyoungsoo Ha&lt;/p&gt;

Preservation of residual hearing after cochlear implant is an important issue with regards to hearing performance. Various methods of steroid administration have been widely used in clinical practice to reduce inflammation and preserve residual hearing. Here we compare the effect of different routes of dexamethasone administration on intracochlear inflammation and residual hearing in guinea pig ears. Dexamethasone was delivered into the guinea pigs either through intracochlear, intratympanic or systemic route. The intracochlear concentration of dexamethasone, residual hearing, inflammatory cytokines and histopathologic changes were evaluated over time. A higher intracochlear dexamethasone concentration was observed after intracochlear administration than through the other routes. Residual hearing was better preserved with local dexamethasone administration as was supported by the reduced inflammatory cytokines, more hair cell survival and less severe intracochlear fibrosis and ossification concurrently seen in the local delivery group than in the systemic group. The results demonstrate that local dexamethasone delivery can reduce intracochlear inflammation and preserve residual hearing better than in systemically administered dexamethasone.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ah-Ra Lyu, Dong Hyun Kim, Seung Hun Lee, Dong-Sik Shin, Sun-Ae Shin, Yong-Ho Park&lt;/p&gt;

Climate change is expected to affect resource-consumer interactions underlying stability in polar food webs. Polar benthic organisms have adapted to the marked seasonality characterising their habitats by concentrating foraging and reproductive activity in summer months, when inputs from sympagic and pelagic producers increase. While this enables the persistence of biodiverse food webs, the mechanisms underlying changes in resource use and nutrient transfer are poorly understood. Thus, our understanding of how temporal and spatial variations in the supply of resources may affect food web structure and functioning is limited. By means of C and N isotopic analyses of two key Antarctic benthic consumers (&lt;i&gt;Adamussium colbecki&lt;/i&gt;, Bivalvia, and &lt;i&gt;Sterechinus neumayeri&lt;/i&gt;, Echinoidea) and Bayesian mixing models, we describe changes in trophic niche and nutrient transfer across trophic levels associated with the long- and short-term diet and body size of specimens sampled in midsummer in both shallow and deep waters. Samplings occurred soon after the sea-ice broke up at Tethys Bay, an area characterised by extreme seasonality in sea-ice coverage and productivity in the Ross Sea. In the long term, the trophic niche was broader and variation between specimens was greater, with intermediate-size specimens generally consuming a higher number of resources than small and large specimens. The coupling of energy channels in the food web was consequently more direct than in the short term. Sediment and benthic algae were more frequently consumed in the long term, before the sea-ice broke up, while consumers specialised on sympagic algae and plankton in the short term. Regardless of the time scale, sympagic algae were more frequently consumed in shallow waters, while plankton was more frequently consumed in deep waters. Our results suggest a strong temporal relationship between resource availability and the trophic niche of benthic consumers in Antarctica. Potential climate-driven changes in the timing and quality of nutrient inputs may have profound implications for the structure of polar food webs and the persistence of their constituent species, which have adapted their trophic niches to a highly predictable schedule of resource inputs.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Edoardo Calizza, Giulio Careddu, Simona Sporta Caputi, Loreto Rossi, Maria Letizia Costantini&lt;/p&gt;

Potential climate-driven changes in the timing and quality of nutrient inputs may have profound implications for the structure of polar food webs and the persistence of their constituent species, which have adapted their trophic niches to a highly predictable schedule of resource inputs.</content></content></item><item><published>1521061200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194424</canonicalUrl><updated>1521061200000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194424</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16225a89689:4e33a3:9f3b30f2</id><title>Phylogeographic analysis reveals high genetic structure with uniform phenotypes in the paper wasp &amp;lt;i&gt;Protonectarina sylveirae&amp;lt;/i&gt; (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194424</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>7bbce36c</fingerprint><author><name>Marjorie da Silva</name></author><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194424</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marjorie da Silva, Fernando Barbosa Noll, Adriana C.

Swarm-founding wasps are endemic and common representatives of neotropical fauna and compose an interesting social tribe of vespids, presenting both complex social characteristics and uncommon traits for a eusocial group, such as the absence of castes with distinct morphology. The paper wasp &lt;i&gt;Protonectarina sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; (Saussure) presents a broad distribution from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, occurring widespread in the Atlantic rainforest and arboreal Caatinga, being absent in the Amazon region. Given the peculiar distribution among swarm-founding wasps, an integrative approach to reconstruct the evolutionary history of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; in a spatial-temporal framework was performed to investigate: the presence of genetic structure and its relationship with the geography, the evolution of distinct morphologic lineages and the possible historical event(s) in Neotropical region, which could explain the observed phylogeographic pattern. Individuals of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; were obtained from populations of 16 areas throughout its distribution for DNA extraction and amplification of mitochondrial genes 12S, 16S and COI. Analysis of genetic diversity, construction of haplotype net, analysis of population structure and dating analysis of divergence time were performed. A morphometric analysis was also performed using 8 measures of the body of the adult (workers) to test if there are morphological distinction among populations. Thirty-five haplotypes were identified, most of them exclusively of a group and a high population structure was found. The possibility of genetic divergence because of isolation by distance was rejected. Morphological analysis pointed to a great uniformity in phenotypes, with only a small degree of differentiation between populations of south and the remaining. Divergence time analysis showed a Middle/Late Miocene origin, a period where an extensive marine ingression occurred in South America. Divergence of haplogroups began from the Plio/Pleistocene boundary and the last glacial maximum most likely modeled the current distribution of species, even though it was not the cause of genetic breaks.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marjorie da Silva, Fernando Barbosa Noll, Adriana C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks have occurred in some countries despite supplementary immunization activities (SIA) using measles-containing vaccine with high vaccination coverage. We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey to estimate population immunity in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic where repeated mass immunization has failed to eliminate measles.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;In this nationwide multistage cluster sampling survey conducted in 2014 based on probability proportionate to size sampling, blood samples were collected from 2,135 children and adults living in 52 randomly selected villages. Anti-measles and anti-rubella IgG were measured, and IgG prevalence was calculated. We applied mathematical modelling to estimate the number of cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in 2013 that were averted by the 2011 SIA. A stability testing was applied to the MR vaccine at 4°C, 25°C, and 35°C to examine stability differences between measles and rubella vaccine components. Measles IgG prevalence was significantly lower in the target age groups (5–21 years) of the 2011 SIA using a combination vaccine for measles and rubella vaccine (MR vaccine) than in young adults (22–39 years) (86.8% [95% CI: 83.0–90.6] vs. 99.0% [98.3–99.8]; p&amp;lt;0.001), whereas rubella IgG prevalence was significantly higher (88.2% [84.5–91.8] vs. 74.6% [70.7–78.5]; p&amp;lt;0.001). In the SIA target age groups, prevalence of measles IgG, but not rubella IgG, increased with age. CRS cases prevented in 2013 ranged from 16 [0–50] to 92 [32–180] if the force of infection had remained unchanged or had been reduced by 75%, respectively. In freeze-dried conditions, the measles vaccine component was more heat sensitive than the rubella component.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Inconsistent IgG prevalence between measles and rubella in Lao PDR can be partly explained by different stability of the measles and rubella vaccine components under heat exposure. Suboptimal vaccine handling may cause insufficient immunogenicity for measles, which subsequently leads to an outbreak despite high SIA coverage, while direct evidence is lacking.

Background &lt;p&gt;Middle ear disease (otitis media) is endemic among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia and represents an important cause of hearing loss. The disease is the result of a mix of biological, environmental and host risk factors that interact in complex, non-linear ways along a dynamic continuum. As such, it is generally recognised that a holistic, systems approach is required to reverse the high rates of otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The objective of this paper is to examine the alignment between efforts designed to address otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Queensland, Australia and core concepts of systems thinking. This paper’s overall purpose is to identify which combination of activities, and at which level, hold the potential to facilitate systems changes to better support ear health among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We began with a review of documents identified in consultation with stakeholders and an online search. In addition, key informants were invited to participate in an online survey and a face-to-face or phone interview. Qualitative interviews using a semi-structured interview guide were used to explore survey responses in more depth. We also undertook interviews at the community level to elicit a diverse range of views. Ideas, statements or activities reported in the documents and interviews as being performed under the Intervention Level Framework were identified using qualitative thematic and content analysis. A quantitative descriptive analysis was also undertaken, whereby data was extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and coded under the relevant strategic directions and performance indicators of the Framework. Subsequently, we coded activities against the five-level intervention framework developed by Malhi and colleagues, that is: 1) paradigm; 2) goals; 3) system structure; 4) feedback and delays; and 5) structural elements.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, twenty documents were reviewed. We examined surveys and interviews with six key informants. Twenty-four individual and 3 group interviews were conducted across central and community level informants. One hundred and four items were coded from the 20 documents and 156 items from interview data. For both data sets, the majority of activities were coded at the structural elements level. The results suggested three key areas where further work is needed to drive sustained improvements: 1) build the governance structures needed for paradigm shift to achieve a multi-sectoral approach; 2) develop shared system level goals; 3) develop system-wide feedback processes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sustained progress in improving ear health within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children requires a holistic, system-wide approach. To advance such work, governance structures for multi-sectoral collaboration including the development of joint goals and monitoring and feedback are required. Intervening at these higher leverage points could have a profound effect on persistent public health issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jo Durham, Lisa Schubert, Lisa Vaughan, Cameron D.

Subsequently, we coded activities against the five-level intervention framework developed by Malhi and colleagues, that is: 1) paradigm; 2) goals; 3) system structure; 4) feedback and delays; and 5) structural elements.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, twenty documents were reviewed. We examined surveys and interviews with six key informants. Twenty-four individual and 3 group interviews were conducted across central and community level informants. One hundred and four items were coded from the 20 documents and 156 items from interview data. For both data sets, the majority of activities were coded at the structural elements level. The results suggested three key areas where further work is needed to drive sustained improvements: 1) build the governance structures needed for paradigm shift to achieve a multi-sectoral approach; 2) develop shared system level goals; 3) develop system-wide feedback processes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sustained progress in improving ear health within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children requires a holistic, system-wide approach. To advance such work, governance structures for multi-sectoral collaboration including the development of joint goals and monitoring and feedback are required. Intervening at these higher leverage points could have a profound effect on persistent public health issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521777600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00141/20180322/images/medium/bi-2018-001417_0007.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>278</height><width>500</width></visual><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00141/20180322/images/medium/bi-2018-001417_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00141&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Local and spontaneous calcium signals play important roles in neurons and neuronal networks. Spontaneous or cell-autonomous calcium signals may be difficult to assess because they appear in an unpredictable spatiotemporal pattern and in very small neuronal loci of axons or dendrites. We developed an open source bioinformatics tool for an unbiased assessment of calcium signals in x,y-t imaging series. The tool bases its algorithm on a continuous wavelet transform-guided peak detection to identify calcium signal candidates. The highly sensitive calcium event definition is based on identification of peaks in 1D data through analysis of a 2D wavelet transform surface. For spatial analysis, the tool uses a grid to separate the x,y-image field in independently analyzed grid windows. A document containing a graphical summary of the data is automatically created and displays the loci of activity for a wide range of signal intensities. Furthermore, the number of activity events is summed up to create an estimated total activity value, which can be used to compare different experimental situations, such as calcium activity before or after an experimental treatment. All traces and data of active loci become documented. The tool can also compute the signal variance in a sliding window to visualize activity-dependent signal fluctuations. We applied the calcium signal detector to monitor activity states of cultured mouse neurons. Our data show that both the total activity value and the variance area created by a sliding window can distinguish experimental manipulations of neuronal activity states. Notably, the tool is powerful enough to compute local calcium events and ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in small loci of distal neurites of neurons, which remain during pharmacological blockade of neuronal activity with inhibitors such as tetrodotoxin, to block action potential firing, or inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The tool can also offer information about local homeostatic calcium activity events in neurites.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fH_ykpqpmQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Prada, Manju Sasi, Corinna Martin, Sibylle Jablonka, Thomas Dandekar, Robert Blum&lt;/p&gt;

Damaged cartilage has very low regenerative potential which has led to the search for novel tissue-engineering approaches to help treat cartilage defects. While various approaches have been reported, there is no perfect treatment currently. In this study we evaluated the effects of a plant extract, chlorogenic acid (CGA), as part of chondrocyte transplantation on a model of knee joint injury in chicks. First, primary cultured chondrocytes used to evaluate the effects of CGA on chondrogenesis. Then using an articular cartilage injury model of chick knee we assessed the functional recovery after transplantation of the complexes containing chondrocytes and CGA in an alginate scaffold. Histological analysis, PCR, and western blot were further used to understand the underlying mechanisms. We showed that 60 μM CGA in alginate exhibited notable effects on stimulating chondrogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Secondly, it was shown that the application of these complexes accelerated the recovery of injury-induced dysfunction by gait analysis when followed for 21 days. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that there was less abnormal vasculature formation, more chondrocyte proliferation and cartilage matrix synthesis in the presence of the complexes containing CGA. We discovered CGA treated transplantation up-regulated the expressions of Sox9 and Col2a1 which were responsible for the stimulation of chondrogenesis. Furthermore, the application of these complexes could suppress the abnormal angiogenesis and fibrosis at the injury site. Lastly, the elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, p-p65, and MMPs expression were decreased in the presence of CGA. This may be caused through adjusting cellular redox homeostasis associated with Nrf2. This study suggests that combining chondrocytes and CGA on an alginate scaffold can improve the recovery of damaged articular cartilage.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xin Cheng, Ke Li, Shengsong Xu, Peizhi Li, Yu Yan, Guang Wang, Zachary Berman, Rui Guo, Jianxin Liang, Sira Traore, Xuesong Yang&lt;/p&gt;

We analyse the behaviour of a non-linear model of coupled stock and bond prices exhibiting periodically collapsing bubbles. By using the formalism of dynamical system theory, we explain what drives the bubbles and how foreshocks or aftershocks are generated. A dynamical phase space representation of that system coupled with standard multiplicative noise rationalises the log-periodic power law singularity pattern documented in many historical financial bubbles. The notion of ‘ghosts of finite-time singularities’ is introduced and used to estimate the end of an evolving bubble, using finite-time singularities of an approximate normal form near the bifurcation point. We test the forecasting skill of this method on different stochastic price realisations and compare with Monte Carlo simulations of the full system. Remarkably, the approximate normal form is significantly more precise and less biased. Moreover, the method of ghosts of singularities is less sensitive to the noise realisation, thus providing more robust forecasts.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Damian Smug, Peter Ashwin, Didier Sornette&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To provide evidence for quantitative magnetic resonance (qMR) biomarkers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy by investigating the relationship between qMR measures of lower extremity muscle pathology and functional endpoints in a large ambulatory cohort using a multicenter study design.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;MR spectroscopy and quantitative imaging were implemented to measure intramuscular fat fraction and the transverse magnetization relaxation time constant (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in lower extremity muscles of 136 participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Measures were collected at 554 visits over 48 months at one of three imaging sites. Fat fraction was measured in the soleus and vastus lateralis using MR spectroscopy, while T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was assessed using MRI in eight lower extremity muscles. Ambulatory function was measured using the 10m walk/run, climb four stairs, supine to stand, and six minute walk tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significant correlations were found between all qMR and functional measures. Vastus lateralis qMR measures correlated most strongly to functional endpoints (|ρ| = 0.68–0.78), although measures in other rapidly progressing muscles including the biceps femoris (|ρ| = 0.63–0.73) and peroneals (|ρ| = 0.59–0.72) also showed strong correlations. Quantitative MR biomarkers were excellent indicators of loss of functional ability and correlated with qualitative measures of function. A VL FF of 0.40 was an approximate lower threshold of muscle pathology associated with loss of ambulation.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Lower extremity qMR biomarkers have a robust relationship to clinically meaningful measures of ambulatory function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Background &lt;p&gt;The WHO recommends maternity waiting homes (MWH) as one intervention to improve maternal and newborn health. However, persistent structural, cultural and financial barriers in their design and implementation have resulted in mixed success in both their uptake and utilization. Guidance is needed on how to design a MWH intervention that is acceptable and sustainable. Using formative research and guided by a sustainability framework for health programs, we systematically collected data from key stakeholders and potential users in order to design a MWH intervention in Zambia that could overcome multi-dimensional barriers to accessing facility delivery, be acceptable to the community and be financially and operationally sustainable.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We used a concurrent triangulation study design and mixed methods. We used free listing to gather input from a total of 167 randomly sampled women who were pregnant or had a child under the age of two (n = 59), men with a child under the age of two (n = 53), and community elders (n = 55) living in the catchment areas of four rural health facilities in Zambia. We conducted 17 focus group discussions (n = 135) among a purposive sample of pregnant women (n = 33), mothers-in-law (n = 32), traditional birth attendants or community maternal health promoters (n = 38), and men with a child under two (n = 32). We administered 38 semi-structured interviews with key informants who were identified by free list respondents as having a stake in the condition and use of MWHs. Lastly, we projected fixed and variable recurrent costs for operating a MWH.Respondents most frequently mentioned distance, roads, transport, and the quality of MWHs and health facilities as the major problems facing pregnant women in their communities. They also cited inadequate advanced planning for delivery and the lack of access to delivery supplies and baby clothes as other problems. Respondents identified the main problems of MWHs specifically as over-crowding, poor infrastructure, lack of amenities, safety concerns, and cultural issues. To support operational sustainability, community members were willing to participate on oversight committees and contribute labor. The annual fixed recurrent cost per 10-bed MWH was estimated as USD543, though providing food and charcoal added another $3,000USD. Respondents identified water pumps, an agriculture shop, a shop for baby clothes and general goods, and grinding mills as needs in their communities that could potentially be linked with an MWH for financial sustainability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings informed the development of an intervention model for renovating existing MWH or constructing new MWH that meets community standards of safety, comfort and services offered and is aligned with government policies related to facility construction, ownership, and access to health services. The basic strategies of the new MWH model include improving community acceptability, strengthening governance and accountability, and building upon existing efforts to foster financial and operational sustainability. The proposed model addresses the problems cited by our respondents and challenges to MWHs identified by in previous studies and elicits opportunities for social enterprises that could serve the dual purpose of meeting a community need and generating revenue for the MWH.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nancy A.

Background &lt;p&gt;The WHO recommends maternity waiting homes (MWH) as one intervention to improve maternal and newborn health. However, persistent structural, cultural and financial barriers in their design and implementation have resulted in mixed success in both their uptake and utilization. Guidance is needed on how to design a MWH intervention that is acceptable and sustainable. Using formative research and guided by a sustainability framework for health programs, we systematically collected data from key stakeholders and potential users in order to design a MWH intervention in Zambia that could overcome multi-dimensional barriers to accessing facility delivery, be acceptable to the community and be financially and operationally sustainable.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We used a concurrent triangulation study design and mixed methods.

Super-critical carbon dioxide energy-storage (SC-CCES) technology is a new type of gas energy-storage technology. This paper used orthogonal method and variance analysis to make significant analysis on the factors which would affect the thermodynamics characteristics of the SC-CCES system and obtained the significant factors and interactions in the energy-storage process, the energy-release process and the whole energy-storage system. Results have shown that the interactions in the components have little influence on the energy-storage process, the energy-release process and the whole energy-storage process of the SC-CCES system, the significant factors are mainly on the characteristics of the system component itself, which will provide reference for the optimization of the thermal properties of the energy-storage system.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Qing He, Yinping Hao, Hui Liu, Wenyi Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Body Mass Index (BMI), like most human phenotypes, is substantially heritable. However, BMI is not normally distributed; the skew appears to be structural, and increases as a function of age. Moreover, twin correlations for BMI commonly violate the assumptions of the most common variety of the classical twin model, with the MZ twin correlation greater than twice the DZ correlation. This study aimed to decompose twin correlations for BMI using more general skew-t distributions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Same sex MZ and DZ twin pairs (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 7,086) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry were included. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to decompose twin correlations for BMI into multiple mixture distributions. LPA was performed using the default normal mixture distribution and the skew-t mixture distribution. Similar analyses were performed for height as a comparison. Our analyses are then replicated in an independent dataset.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A two-class solution under the skew-t mixture distribution fits the BMI distribution for both genders. The first class consists of a relatively normally distributed, highly heritable BMI with a mean in the normal range. The second class is a positively skewed BMI in the overweight and obese range, with lower twin correlations. In contrast, height is normally distributed, highly heritable, and is well-fit by a single latent class. Results in the replication dataset were highly similar.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that two distinct processes underlie the skew of the BMI distribution. The contrast between height and weight is in accord with subjective psychological experience: both are under obvious genetic influence, but BMI is also subject to behavioral control, whereas height is not.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Siny Tsang, Glen E.

Animal models commonly serve as a bridge between &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments and clinical applications; however, few physiological processes in adult animals are sufficient to serve as proof-of-concept models for cartilage regeneration. Intriguingly, some rodents, such as young adult mice, undergo physiological connective tissue modifications to birth canal elements such as the pubic symphysis during pregnancy; therefore, we investigated whether the differential expression of cartilage differentiation markers is associated with cartilaginous tissue morphological modifications during these changes. Our results showed that osteochondral progenitor cells expressing &lt;i&gt;Runx2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sox9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Col2a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dcx&lt;/i&gt; at the non-pregnant pubic symphysis proliferated and differentiated throughout pregnancy, giving rise to a complex osteoligamentous junction that attached the interpubic ligament to the pubic bones until labour occurred. After delivery, the recovery of pubic symphysis cartilaginous tissues was improved by the time-dependent expression of these chondrocytic lineage markers at the osteoligamentous junction. This process potentially recapitulates embryologic chondrocytic differentiation to successfully recover hyaline cartilaginous pads at 10 days postpartum.

Succulent cacti (Cactaceae) are among the most threatened taxonomic groups assessed to date. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity and population structure of a narrow endemic columnar cactus &lt;i&gt;Pilosocereus aureispinus&lt;/i&gt;. This species is only found in a small area of c. 300 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of rocky savanna from eastern Brazil and it is currently classified as vulnerable (VU) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Eight microsatellite loci were genotyped for 91 individuals from four localities of the known &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt; range. In contrast with expectations for narrow endemic species, we found relatively high levels of genetic diversity (e.g., &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.390 to 0.525; &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.394 to 0.572) and very low population structure based on the variation of six loci. All the analyzed individuals were clustered in one unique genetic group in assignment tests. We also generated the sequences of two plastid markers (&lt;i&gt;trnT-trnL&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;psbD-trnT&lt;/i&gt;) and found no variation on a subsample of 39 individuals. We used Landsat 8 images and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to estimate a potential extent of occurrence of c. 750 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for this species. Our results showed that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt; is not suffering from erosion of nuclear genetic variability due to its narrow distribution. However, we advocate that because of the extremely limited extent of occurrence, the ongoing anthropogenic disturbances in its habitat, and phylogenetic distinctiveness of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt;, this species should be classified as endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gulzar Khan, Paulianny M.

The poorly understood mechanisms of dry season persistence of &lt;i&gt;Anopheles&lt;/i&gt; spp. mosquitoes through the dry season in Africa remain a critical gap in our knowledge of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; disease transmission. While it is thought that adult mosquitoes remain in a dormant state throughout this seven-month dry season, the nature of this state remains unknown and has largely not been recapitulated in laboratory settings. To elucidate possible connections of this state with microbial composition, the whole body microbiomes of adult mosquitoes in the dry and wet seasons in two locations of Mali with varying water availability were compared by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. These locations were a village near the Niger River with year-round water sources (N’Gabakoro, “riparian”), and a typical Sahelian area with highly seasonal breeding sites (Thierola Area, “Sahelian”). The 16S bacterial data consisted of 2057 sequence variants in 426 genera across 184 families. From these data, we found several compositional differences that were seasonally and spatially linked. Counter to our initial hypothesis, there were more pronounced seasonal differences in the bacterial microbiome of riparian, rather than Sahelian areas. These seasonal shifts were primarily in &lt;i&gt;Ralstonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sphingorhabdus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Duganella&lt;/i&gt; spp. bacteria that are usually soil and water-associated, indicating these changes may be from bacteria acquired in the larval environment, rather than adulthood. In Sahelian dry season mosquitoes, there was a unique intracellular bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Anaplasma&lt;/i&gt;, which likely was acquired through non-human blood feeding. Cytochrome B analysis of blood meals showed greater heterogeneity in host choice of &lt;i&gt;An&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coluzzii&lt;/i&gt; independent of season in the Thierola area compared to N’Gabakoro (77.5% vs. 94.6% human-origin blood meal, respectively), indicating a relaxation of anthropophily. Overall, this exploratory study provides valuable indications of spatial and seasonal differences in bacterial composition which help refine this difficult to study state.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin J.

We used argon-40/argon-39 and uranium-series dating to calibrate the chronology of Acheulean and early MSA artifact–rich sedimentary deposits in the Olorgesailie basin, southern Kenya rift. We determined the age of late Acheulean tool assemblages from 615,000 to 499,000 years ago, after which a large technological and faunal transition occurred, with a definitive MSA lacking Acheulean elements beginning most likely by ~320,000 years ago, but at least by 305,000 years ago.

This paper examines the effect of maternal socio-economic status in the household, such as their autonomy, ability, freedom and bargaining power, on child birth registration in India using the nationally representative India Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II), 2011–12. We have estimated a multilevel mixed effects model which accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data and allows us to examine the effects of unobserved ‘district’ and ‘community’ characteristics along with individual child level characteristics on probability of birth registration. The results show that between-districts and between individuals differences share a considerably high and an almost equal proportion of the variations in probability of birth registration in India. At individual child level, mother’s socio-economic status such as her ability to move around independently and her exposure to outside world, significantly raise the probability of birth registration. More importantly, the marginal effects of the maternal autonomy indicators: mother’s ability to move around freely and her control over resources, on birth registration vary across districts in India. Other variables such as institutional birth, mother’s antenatal care seeking behaviour, caste, religion, household wealth and parental education are significant determinants of birth registration.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Itismita Mohanty, Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin&lt;/p&gt;

Light causes damage to the retina (phototoxicity) and decreases photoreceptor responses to light. The most harmful component of visible light is the blue wavelength (400–500 nm). Different filters have been tested, but so far all of them allow passing a lot of this wavelength (70%). The aim of this work has been to prove that a filter that removes 94% of the blue component may protect the function and morphology of the retina significantly. Three experimental groups were designed. The first group was unexposed to light, the second one was exposed and the third one was exposed and protected by a blue-blocking filter. Light damage was induced in young albino mice (p30) by exposing them to white light of high intensity (5,000 lux) continuously for 7 days. Short wavelength light filters were used for light protection. The blue component was removed (94%) from the light source by our filter. Electroretinographical recordings were performed before and after light damage. Changes in retinal structure were studied using immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL labeling. Also, cells in the outer nuclear layer were counted and compared among the three different groups. Functional visual responses were significantly more conserved in protected animals (with the blue-blocking filter) than in unprotected animals. Also, retinal structure was better kept and photoreceptor survival was greater in protected animals, these differences were significant in central areas of the retina. Still, functional and morphological responses were significantly lower in protected than in unexposed groups. In conclusion, this blue-blocking filter decreases significantly photoreceptor damage after exposure to high intensity light. Actually, our eyes are exposed for a very long time to high levels of blue light (screens, artificial light LED, neons…). The potential damage caused by blue light can be palliated.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Javier Vicente-Tejedor, Miguel Marchena, Laura Ramírez, Diego García-Ayuso, Violeta Gómez-Vicente, Celia Sánchez-Ramos, Pedro de la Villa, Francisco Germain&lt;/p&gt;

In conclusion, this blue-blocking filter decreases significantly photoreceptor damage after exposure to high intensity light. Actually, our eyes are exposed for a very long time to high levels of blue light (screens, artificial light LED, neons…). The potential damage caused by blue light can be palliated.</content></content></item><item><published>1521010800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03036-4/d41586-018-03036-4_15515276.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><width>1024</width></visual><unread>False</unread><title>Geoengineer polar glaciers to slow sea-level rise</title><engagement>200</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03036-4</originId><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162246ca53f:28e7b6:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03036-4</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>c954f72e</fingerprint><author><name>John C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Healthcare students are future health care providers and serve as role models and coaches to enhance behaviors for healthy lifestyles. However healthcare students face multiple stressors that could lead to adopting risk behaviors.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the changes in health risk factors among healthcare students between 2007 and 2015, and to identify specific health behaviors based on the curriculum in a population of healthcare students:&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two cross sectionnal studies were conducted in 2007 and 2015 among nursing, medical, pharmacy, and physiotherapy students (Rouen, France). During compulsory courses and examination sessions students filled self-administered questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics and behavior as: tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, cannabis consumption, eating disorders, regular practice of sport, perceived health, stress and use of psychotropic drugs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;2,605 healthcare students were included (1,326 in 2007 and 1,279 in 2015), comprising 1,225 medical students (47.0%), 738 nursing students (28.3%), 362 pharmacy students (13.9%), and 280 physiotherapy students (10.8%). Between 2007 and 2015, occasional binge drinking and regular practice of sport increased significantly among healthcare students, respectively AOR = 1.48 CI95% (1.20–1.83) and AOR = 1.33 CI95% (1.11–1.60), regular cannabis consumption decreased significantly, AOR = 0.32 CI95% (0.19–0.54). There was no change in smoking or overweight/obese. There was a higher risk of frequent binge drinking and a lower risk of tobacco smoking in all curricula than in nursing students. Medical students practiced sport on a more regular basis, were less overweight/obese, had fewer eating disorders than nursing students.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate a stable frequency of classic behaviors as smoking but a worsening of emerging behaviors as binge drinking among healthcare students between 2007 and 2015. Health behaviors differed according to healthcare curricula and nursing students demonstrated higher risks. As health behaviors are positively related to favorable attitudes towards preventive counseling, therefore healthcare students should receive training in preventive counseling and develop healthy lifestyles targeted according to the health curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by M.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence rate and associated factors of co-morbid mental disability among the elderly with motor disability. Data was obtained from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability (CNSSD). 250,752 older adults aged 65 years and above were sampled from 5964 sites, 2980 towns, 734 counties in 31 provinces in China. Descriptive statistics were used for population-weighted numbers and prevalence of co-morbid mental disability by different characteristics. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the association between mental disability, and the factors of co-morbid mental disability among physical disability. Among the elderly with motor disability, 275,607 persons (2.28%, 99% CI: 1.97–2.59) had co-morbid mental disability at the survey time, which was significantly higher than those without motor disability (OR: 2.11, 99% CI: 1.83–2.43). The factors associated with a higher risk of co-morbid mental disability included urban areas (OR: 1.38; 99% CI: 1.04–1.84), east (2.60, 1.76–3.83) or west (1.65, 1.06–2.55) regions, having other co-morbid disabilities (5.93, 4.48–7.85), and having more severe motor disability (Moderate: 1.81, 1.28–2.57; Severe: 2.90, 2.08–4.04; Extremely severe: 4.22, 2.96–6.01). The elderly with motor disability have a high risk of co-morbid mental disability, especially for higher socioeconomic groups. These findings highlight the need of and will be beneficial for implementing more comprehensive prevention and rehabilitation strategies, to prevent and control the emergence and development of multiple disabilities and promote the physical and mental health of the elderly.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guo, Ping He, Xinming Song, Gong Chen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Our results indicate that intrinsic hyperexcitability is unlikely to be the cause of motoneuron degeneration.</description><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords></item><item><published>1521493200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</canonicalUrl><updated>1521493200000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fe:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Identification of aaNAT5b as a spermine N-acetyltransferase in the mosquito, &amp;lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ff4d936c</fingerprint><author><name>Huai Guan</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huai Guan, Maoying Wang, Chenghong Liao, Jing Liang, Prajwalini Mehere, Meiling Tian, Hairong Liu, Howard Robinson, Jianyong Li, Qian Han&lt;/p&gt;
Mosquitoes transmit a number of diseases in animals and humans, including Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses that affect millions of people each year. Controlling the disease-transmitting mosquitoes has proven to be a successful strategy to reduce the viruses transmission. Polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus, and a depletion of spermidine and spermine in the host via induction of spermine N-acetyltransferase restricts their replication. Spermine N-acetyltransferase is a key catabolic enzyme in the polyamine pathway, however there is no information of the enzyme identification in any insects. Aliphatic polyamines play a fundamental role in tissue growth and development in organisms. They are acetylated by spermidine/spermine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-acetyltransferase (SAT). In this study we provided a molecular and biochemical identification of SAT from &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. Screening of purified recombinant proteins against polyamines established that aaNAT5b, named previously based on sequence similarity with identified aaNAT1 in insects, is active to spermine and spermidine. A crystal structure was determined and used in molecular docking in this study. Key residues were identified to be involved in spermine binding using molecular docking and simulation. In addition, SAT transcript was down regulated by blood feeding using a real time PCR test. Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Huai Guan, Maoying Wang, Chenghong Liao, Jing Liang, Prajwalini Mehere, Meiling Tian, Hairong Liu, Howard Robinson, Jianyong Li, Qian Han&lt;/p&gt;

We propose a novel approach to modelling rater effects in scoring-based assessment. The approach is based on a Bayesian hierarchical model and simulations from the posterior distribution. We apply it to large-scale essay assessment data over a period of 5 years. Empirical results suggest that the model provides a good fit for both the total scores and when applied to individual rubrics. We estimate the median impact of rater effects on the final grade to be ± 2 points on a 50 point scale, while 10% of essays would receive a score at least ± 5 different from their actual quality. Most of the impact is due to rater unreliability, not rater bias.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kaja Zupanc, Erik Štrumbelj&lt;/p&gt;

Increasing evidence indicates that the Golgi apparatus plays active roles in cancer, but a comprehensive understanding of its functions in the oncogenic transformation has not yet emerged. At the same time, the Golgi is becoming well recognized as a hub that integrates its functions of protein and lipid biosynthesis to signal transduction for cell proliferation and migration in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the active function of the Golgi apparatus in cancer cells has not been fully evaluated as a target for combined treatment. Here, we analyzed the effect of perturbing the Golgi apparatus on the sensitivity of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to the drugs Actinomycin D and Vinblastine. We disrupted the function of ARF1, a protein necessary for the homeostasis of the Golgi apparatus. We found that the expression of the ARF1-Q71L mutant increased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to both Actinomycin D and Vinblastine, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and cell migration, as well as in increased apoptosis. Likewise, the combined treatment of cells with Actinomycin D or Vinblastine and Brefeldin A or Golgicide A, two disrupting agents of the ARF1 function, resulted in similar effects on cell proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis. Interestingly, each combined treatment had distinct effects on ERK1/2 and AKT signaling, as indicated by the decreased levels of either phospho-ERK1/2 or phospho-AKT. Our results suggest that disruption of Golgi function could be used as a strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Charlotte Luchsinger, Marcelo Aguilar, Patricia V.

We test the hypothesis that prehistoric Native American land use influenced the Euro-American settlement process in a South Carolina Piedmont landscape. Long term ecological studies demonstrate that land use legacies influence processes and trajectories in complex, coupled social and ecological systems. Native American land use likely altered the ecological and evolutionary feedback and trajectories of many North American landscapes. Yet, considerable debate revolves around the scale and extent of land use legacies of prehistoric Native Americans. At the core of this debate is the question of whether or not European colonists settled a mostly “wild” landscape or an already “humanized” landscape. We use statistical event analysis to model the effects of prehistoric Native American settlement on the rate of Colonial land grants (1749–1775). Our results reveal how abandoned Native American settlements were among the first areas claimed and homesteaded by Euro-Americans. We suggest that prehistoric land use legacies served as key focal nodes in the Colonial era settlement process. As a consequence, localized prehistoric land use legacies likely helped structure the long term, landscape- to regional-level ecological inheritances that resulted from Euro-American settlement.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael R.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) consist of a population of self-renewing cells displaying extensive phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. Research towards the understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity among ESCs is still in its initial stage. Key issues, such as how to identify cell-subset specifically methylated loci and how to interpret the biological meanings of methylation variations remain largely unexplored. To fill in the research gap, we implemented a computational pipeline to analyze single-cell methylome and to perform an integrative analysis with single-cell transcriptome data. According to the origins of variation in DNA methylation, we determined the genomic loci associated with allelic-specific methylation or asymmetric DNA methylation, and explored a beta mixture model to infer the genomic loci exhibiting cell-subset specific methylation (CSM). We observed that the putative CSM loci in ESCs are significantly enriched in CpG island (CGI) shelves and regions with histone marks for promoter and enhancer, and the genes hosting putative CSM loci show wide-ranging expression among ESCs. More interestingly, the putative CSM loci may be clustered into co-methylated modules enriching the binding motifs of distinct sets of transcription factors. Taken together, our study provided a novel tool to explore single-cell methylome and transcriptome to reveal the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks associated with epigenetic heterogeneity of ESCs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f7Po2bpx1o8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yanting Luo, Jianlin He, Xiguang Xu, Ming-an Sun, Xiaowei Wu, Xuemei Lu, Hehuang Xie&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, mRNA localization enables spatiotemporal control of mTOR pathways regulating local translation and long-range intracellular signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description><keywords><item>Cell Biology, Neuroscience</item></keywords></item><item><published>1522220400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23673-z/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23673_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height><width>542</width></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Dexras1 is a homeostatic regulator of exercise-dependent proliferation and cell survival in the hippocampal neurogenic niche</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23673-z</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1626be58cb9:679a5c6:7d6c1c1c</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23673-z</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/y7xld_SgRbw/s41598-018-23673-z</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>22bfd686</fingerprint><author><name>Pascale Bouchard-Cannon</name></author><crawled>1522228628665</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23673-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dexras1 is a homeostatic regulator of exercise-dependent proliferation and cell survival in the hippocampal neurogenic niche&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dexras1 is a homeostatic regulator of exercise-dependent proliferation and cell survival in the hippocampal neurogenic niche, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23673-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23673-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dexras1 is a homeostatic regulator of exercise-dependent proliferation and cell survival in the hippocampal neurogenic niche&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/y7xld_SgRbw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dexras1 is a homeostatic regulator of exercise-dependent proliferation and cell survival in the hippocampal neurogenic niche&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dexras1 is a homeostatic regulator of exercise-dependent proliferation and cell survival in the hippocampal neurogenic niche, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23673-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23673-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dexras1 is a homeostatic regulator of exercise-dependent proliferation and cell survival in the hippocampal neurogenic niche&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/y7xld_SgRbw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522168915000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/13/E2940/F1.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>307</height><width>440</width></visual><unread>True</unread><title>CD96 expression determines the inflammatory potential of IL-9-producing Th9 cells [Immunology and Inflammation]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2940.short?rss=1</originId><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1626893ee0e:63522cf:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2940</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2940.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>627780d8</fingerprint><author><name>Katarina Stanko, Christina Iwert, Christine Appelt, Katrin Vogt, Julia Schumann, Franziska Janina Strunk, Stefanie Ahrlich, Stephan Schlickeiser, Chiara Romagnani, Karsten Jurchott, Christian Meisel, Gerald Willimsky, Anȷa A.

Adapting community-based protected areas to local context and evaluating their success across a range of possible socio-economic and ecological outcomes depends, in part, on understanding the perceptions of local actors. This article presents results from a mixed methods study that focuses on how and why religious identity, a prominent aspect of Ghanaian culture, is related to perceptions of the performance of several Community Resource Management Areas (CREMAs). CREMAs are a form of Ghanaian protected area that emphasizes community participation and a range of socio-economic and ecological objectives. Using importance-satisfaction analysis, large-scale survey results show that respondents that identify as Christians consistently assign greater importance to CREMA outcomes than do those that identify with Traditional religions. Education and whether respondents were native to an area (both of which were correlated with religious identity) were also systematically related to perceptions of CREMA importance, with those that are educated and non-native to an area tending to assign higher importance to CREMA outcomes. Follow up focus group participants from the Avu Lagoon CREMA suggest that the patterns result from differing ‘openness’ to new ideas, relative dependence on natural resources, acceptance of Traditional practices associated with conservation, and a sense, for some, that ecological conditions are divinely ordained. Christianity, education and non-nativity are associated with much larger performance gaps, particularly with respect to socio-economic impacts. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for conservation interventions and the use of perceptions in assessing protected area performance.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Grant Murray, Andrew Agyare&lt;/p&gt;

The red flour beetle, &lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/i&gt;, is an important model insect and agricultural pest. However, many standard genetic tools are lacking or underdeveloped in this system. Here, we present a set of new reagents to augment existing &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; genetic tools. We demonstrate a new GAL4 driver line that employs the promoter of a ribosomal protein gene to drive expression of a UAS responder in the fat body. We also present a novel dual fluorescent reporter that labels cell membranes and nuclei with different fluorophores for the analysis of cellular morphology. This approach also demonstrates the functionality of the viral T2A peptide for bicistronic gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt;. To facilitate classical genetic analysis, we created lines with visible genetic markers by CRISPR-mediated disruption of the &lt;i&gt;yellow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ebony&lt;/i&gt; body color loci with a cassette carrying an attP site, enabling future φC31-mediated integration. Together, the reagents presented here will facilitate more robust genetic analysis in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; and serve as a blueprint for the further development of this powerful model’s genetic toolkit.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Johnathan C.

We demonstrate a new GAL4 driver line that employs the promoter of a ribosomal protein gene to drive expression of a UAS responder in the fat body. We also present a novel dual fluorescent reporter that labels cell membranes and nuclei with different fluorophores for the analysis of cellular morphology. This approach also demonstrates the functionality of the viral T2A peptide for bicistronic gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt;. To facilitate classical genetic analysis, we created lines with visible genetic markers by CRISPR-mediated disruption of the &lt;i&gt;yellow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ebony&lt;/i&gt; body color loci with a cassette carrying an attP site, enabling future φC31-mediated integration. Together, the reagents presented here will facilitate more robust genetic analysis in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; and serve as a blueprint for the further development of this powerful model’s genetic toolkit.</content></content></item><item><published>1522950073000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Previous research suggests that the complex symbolic, technological, and socioeconomic behaviors that typify &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt; had roots in the middle Pleistocene &amp;lt;200,000 years ago, but data bearing on human behavioral origins are limited.

Side scan sonar in low-cost ‘fishfinder’ systems has become popular in aquatic ecology and sedimentology for imaging submerged riverbed sediment at coverages and resolutions sufficient to relate bed texture to grain-size. Traditional methods to map bed texture (i.e. physical samples) are relatively high-cost and low spatial coverage compared to sonar, which can continuously image several kilometers of channel in a few hours. Towards a goal of automating the classification of bed habitat features, we investigate relationships between substrates and statistical descriptors of bed textures in side scan sonar echograms of alluvial deposits. We develop a method for automated segmentation of bed textures into between two to five grain-size classes. Second-order texture statistics are used in conjunction with a Gaussian Mixture Model to classify the heterogeneous bed into small homogeneous patches of sand, gravel, and boulders with an average accuracy of 80%, 49%, and 61%, respectively. Reach-averaged proportions of these sediment types were within 3% compared to similar maps derived from multibeam sonar.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Hamill, Daniel Buscombe, Joseph M.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is a thrombotic microangiopathy arising from consumption of both coagulation factors and platelets. DIC is triggered by a number of clinical conditions including severe infection, trauma and obstetric complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition is paramount. A high clinical index of suspicion is needed to ensure that patients at risk of developing DIC are appropriately investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In order to establish the clinical conditions most frequently associated with DIC, we reviewed all DIC screens received at a tertiary hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa over a 1 year period.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The commonest clinical condition associated with DIC in our population was infection with 84% of patients infected with an identified pathogen. The most frequently diagnosed pathogen was HIV followed by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; and other bacterial infections. In the majority of cases, bacteria were isolated from blood cultures. In 47 patients, HIV was the only pathogen which could be isolated. A relative risk ratio of 2.73 and an odds ratio of 29.97 was attributed to HIV for development of a DIC. A malignancy was present in 51 of the patients of which approximately 60% had co-existing infection. No cause could be attributed in 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Infection was identified in the majority of the patients diagnosed with DIC in this study. HIV showed the highest relative risk ratio of all pathogens although previous studies have not suggested that HIV was strongly associated with DIC. In almost half of the HIV infected patients, there was no other pathogen isolated despite extensive investigation. This suggests that HIV has a strong association with the development of DIC, warranting further research into the relationship between HIV and disseminated microvascular thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth S.

Various approaches have been proposed to address the delineation of built-up areas for a wide range of applications. Recently developed approaches are based on the increasing availability of road network data. However, most approaches have employed one or more parameters to divide built-up from non-built-up areas. Very few studies have discussed how to determine appropriate thresholds for such parameters. This study employed an empirical approach for threshold determination, and validated that the approach is applicable for the delineation of built-up areas using road network data. A series of experiments were designed to investigate the most-appropriate thresholds (determined using a similarity measure) for multiple parameters of three existing approaches (street blocks, grid-based, and kernel density) with regard to different administrative regions and cities/towns. The results show that in most cases, the most-appropriate thresholds or ranges for different subdivisions are either identical or overlap—thus validating the use of the most-appropriate thresholds to delineate built-up areas for one or multiple small subdivisions and, by inference, for a much larger region.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Qi Zhou, Lei Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;China is the largest developing country with a relatively developed public health system. To further prevent and eliminate the spread of infectious diseases, China has listed 39 notifiable infectious diseases characterized by wide prevalence or great harm, and classified them into classes A, B, and C, with severity decreasing across classes. Class A diseases have been almost eradicated in China, thus making class B diseases a priority in infectious disease prevention and control. In this retrospective study, we analyze the spatial distribution patterns of 12 class B notifiable infectious diseases that remain active all over China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Global and local Moran’s I and corresponding graphic tools are adopted to explore and visualize the global and local spatial distribution of the incidence of the selected epidemics, respectively. Inter-correlations of clustering patterns of each pair of diseases and a cumulative summary of the high/low cluster frequency of the provincial units are also provided by means of figures and maps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 12 most commonly notifiable class B infectious diseases, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis show high incidence rates and account for more than half of the reported cases. Almost all the diseases, except pertussis, exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation at the provincial level. All diseases feature varying spatial concentrations. Nevertheless, associations exist between spatial distribution patterns, with some provincial units displaying the same type of cluster features for two or more infectious diseases. Overall, high–low (unit with high incidence surrounded by units with high incidence, the same below) and high–high spatial cluster areas tend to be prevalent in the provincial units located in western and southwest China, whereas low–low and low–high spatial cluster areas abound in provincial units in north and east China.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Despite the various distribution patterns of 12 class B notifiable infectious diseases, certain similarities between their spatial distributions are present. Substantial evidence is available to support disease-specific, location-specific, and disease-combined interventions. Regarding provinces that show high–high/high–low patterns of multiple diseases, comprehensive interventions targeting different diseases should be established.

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous deletion of 26–28 genes at chromosome band 7q11.23. The complete deletion (CD) mouse model mimics the most common deletion found in WBS patients and recapitulates most neurologic features of the disorder along with some cardiovascular manifestations leading to significant cardiac hypertrophy with increased cardiomyocytes’ size. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin found in green tea, has been associated with potential health benefits, both on cognition and cardiovascular phenotypes, through several mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the effects of green tea extracts on WBS-related phenotypes through a phase I clinical trial in mice. After feeding CD animals with green tea extracts dissolved in the drinking water, starting at three different time periods (prenatal, youth and adulthood), a set of behavioral tests and several anatomical, histological and molecular analyses were performed. Treatment resulted to be effective in the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and was also able to ameliorate short-term memory deficits of CD mice. Taken together, these results suggest that EGCG might have a therapeutic and/or preventive role in the management of WBS.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paula Ortiz-Romero, Cristina Borralleras, Mònica Bosch-Morató, Biuse Guivernau, Guillermo Albericio, Francisco J.

The present study aimed to explore how state self-control influences the intertemporal decisions made by individuals with high and low trait self-control. State self-control, represented by the degree of depletion, was manipulated by conducting Stroop tasks with different levels of difficulty, and the intertemporal decision task was used as a self-control task. Compared with participants with high trait self-control, the preferences of participants with low trait self-control for immediate rewards were more vulnerable to the difficulty of depletion tasks. Throughout the experimental stages, the heart rate variability (HRV) of participants with high trait self-control was significantly higher than that of participants with low trait self-control, indicating that individuals with high trait self-control may have stronger and more stable self-control abilities.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Guan, Jiamei He&lt;/p&gt;

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Aspartame (L-aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester) is a non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) approved for use in more than 6000 dietary products and pharmaceuticals consumed by the general public including adults and children, pregnant and nursing mothers. However a recent prospective study reported a doubling of the risk of being overweight amongst 1-year old children whose mothers consumed NNS-sweetened beverages daily during pregnancy. We have previously shown that chronic aspartame (ASP) exposure commencing &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; may detrimentally affect adulthood adiposity status, glucose metabolism and aspects of behavior and spatial cognition, and that this can be modulated by developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade with the competitive antagonist CGP 39551 (CGP). Since glucose homeostasis and certain aspects of behavior and locomotion are regulated in part by the NMDAR-rich hypothalamus, which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal- (HPA) axis, we have elected to examine changes in hypothalamic and adrenal gene expression in response to ASP exposure in the presence or absence of developmental NMDAR antagonism with CGP, using Affymetrix microarray analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using 2-factor ANOVA we identified 189 ASP-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the adult male hypothalamus and 2188 in the adrenals, and a further 23 hypothalamic and 232 adrenal genes significantly regulated by developmental treatment with CGP alone. ASP exposure robustly elevated the expression of a network of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis, together with cell stress and inflammatory genes, consistent with previous reports of aspartame-induced CNS stress and oxidative damage. These genes were not differentially expressed in ASP mice with CGP antagonism. In the adrenal glands of ASP-exposed mice, GABA and Glutamate receptor subunit genes were amongst those most highly upregulated. Developmental NMDAR antagonism alone had less effect on adulthood gene expression and affected mainly hypothalamic neurogenesis and adrenal steroid metabolism. Combined ASP + CGP treatment mainly upregulated genes involved in adrenal drug and cholesterol metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ASP exposure increased the expression of functional networks of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis and adrenal catecholamine synthesis, patterns of expression which were not present in ASP-exposed mice with developmental NMDAR antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kate S.

Combined ASP + CGP treatment mainly upregulated genes involved in adrenal drug and cholesterol metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ASP exposure increased the expression of functional networks of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis and adrenal catecholamine synthesis, patterns of expression which were not present in ASP-exposed mice with developmental NMDAR antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1523554635000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Ancient sites savaged in Yemen, Iraq</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/140?rss=1</originId><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:feceae:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/140.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/140?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>b5ef8fcb</fingerprint><author><name>Lawler, A.</name></author><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/140?rss=1</link><keywords><item>Anthropology, Scientific Community</item></keywords></item><item><published>1523318400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Artificially activating neurons in the cortex can make a tetraplegic patient feel naturalistic sensations of skin pressure and arm movement.</content></summary><title>Regaining the senses of touch and movement</title><engagement>3</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36137</originId><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162af52026b:1c292eb:923c4a60</id><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36137</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36137</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>c01a5db9</fingerprint><author><name>lafuente@unam.mx (Victor de Lafuente)</name></author><crawled>1523359810155</crawled><engagementRate>0.25</engagementRate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36137</link><description>Artificially activating neurons in the cortex can make a tetraplegic patient feel naturalistic sensations of skin pressure and arm movement.</description><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords></item><item><published>1523516400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Author Correction: Disturbance Regimes Drive The Diversity of Regional Floristic Pools Across Guianan Rainforest Landscapes</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24182-9</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b924a6a3:c62b9a:34f43e70</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24182-9</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/wzhtJ9uMh8g/s41598-018-24182-9</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>c316a73</fingerprint><author><name>Stéphane Guitet</name></author><crawled>1523524609699</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24182-9</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Disturbance Regimes Drive The Diversity of Regional Floristic Pools Across Guianan Rainforest Landscapes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Disturbance Regimes Drive The Diversity of Regional Floristic Pools Across Guianan Rainforest Landscapes, Published online: 12 April 2018;

Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator of ecosystem functioning but how ecosystem WUE responds to climate change including precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition increases is still unknown. To investigate such responses, an experiment with a randomized block design with water (spring snowfall or summer water addition) and nitrogen addition was conducted in a temperate steppe of northern China. We investigated net ecosystem CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (NEP), gross ecosystem production (GEP) and evapotranspiration (ET) to calculate ecosystem WUE (WUEnep = NEP/ET or WUEgep = GEP/ET) under spring snow and summer water addition with or without N addition from 2011 to 2013. The results showed that spring snow addition only had significant effect on ecosystem WUE in 2013 and summer water addition showed positive effect on ecosystem WUE in 2011 and 2013, as their effects on NEP and GEP is stronger than ET. N addition increased ecosystem WUE in 2012 and 2013 both in spring snow addition and summer water addition for its increasing effects on NEP and GEP but no effect on ET. Summer water addition had less but N addition had greater increasing effects on ecosystem WUE as natural precipitation increase indicating that natural precipitation regulates ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition. Moreover, WUE was tightly related with atmospheric vapor-pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), precipitation and soil moisture indicating the regulation of climate drivers on ecosystem WUE. In addition, it also was affected by aboveground net primary production (ANPP). The study suggests that ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition is determined by the change in carbon process rather than that in water process, which are regulated by climate change in the temperate steppe of northern China.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaolin Zhang, Penghui Zhai, Jianhui Huang, Xiang Zhao, Kuanhu Dong&lt;/p&gt;

Changes in pathogen genetic variation within hosts alter the severity and spread of infectious diseases, with important implications for clinical disease and public health. Genetic drift may play a strong role in shaping pathogen variation, but analyses of drift in pathogens have oversimplified pathogen population dynamics, either by considering dynamics only at a single scale—such as within hosts or between hosts—or by making drastic simplifying assumptions, for example, that host immune systems can be ignored or that transmission bottlenecks are complete. Moreover, previous studies have used genetic data to infer the strength of genetic drift, whereas we test whether the genetic drift imposed by pathogen population processes can be used to explain genetic data. We first constructed and parameterized a mathematical model of gypsy moth baculovirus dynamics that allows genetic drift to act within and between hosts. We then quantified the genome-wide diversity of baculovirus populations within each of 143 field-collected gypsy moth larvae using Illumina sequencing. Finally, we determined whether the genetic drift imposed by host–pathogen population dynamics in our model explains the levels of pathogen diversity in our data. We found that when the model allows drift to act at multiple scales—including within hosts, between hosts, and between years—it can accurately reproduce the data, but when the effects of drift are simplified by neglecting transmission bottlenecks and stochastic variation in virus replication within hosts, the model fails. A de novo mutation model and a purifying selection model similarly fail to explain the data. Our results show that genetic drift can play a strong role in determining pathogen variation and that mathematical models that account for pathogen population growth at multiple scales of biological organization can be used to explain this variation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bmOg3KEZQRc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by David A.

Protein myristoylation is a key protein modification carried out by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) after Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) removes methionine from the amino-terminus of the target protein. Protein myristoylation by NMT augments several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including developmental pathways and pathways that when dysregulated lead to cancer or immune dysfunction. The emerging evidence pointing to NMT-mediated myristoylation as a major cellular regulator underscores the importance of understanding the framework of this type of signaling event. Various studies have investigated the role that myristoylation plays in signaling dysfunction by examining differential gene or protein expression between normal and diseased states, such as cancers or following HIV-1 infection, however no study exists that addresses the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of myristoylation. By performing a large scale bioinformatics and functional analysis of the miRNAs that target key genes involved in myristoylation (NMT1, NMT2, MetAP2), we have narrowed down a list of promising candidates for further analysis. Our condensed panel of miRNAs identifies 35 miRNAs linked to cancer, 21 miRNAs linked to developmental and immune signaling pathways, and 14 miRNAs linked to infectious disease (primarily HIV). The miRNAs panel that was analyzed revealed several NMT-targeting mRNAs (messenger RNA) that are implicated in diseases associated with NMT signaling alteration, providing a link between the realms of miRNA and myristoylation signaling. These findings verify miRNA as an additional facet of myristoylation signaling that must be considered to gain a full perspective. This study provides the groundwork for future studies concerning NMT-transcript-binding miRNAs, and will potentially lead to the development of new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for several important diseases.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ranjit Chauhan, David Datzkiw, Shailly Varma Shrivastav, Anuraag Shrivastav&lt;/p&gt;

Terrestrial plants can harbor endophytic fungi that may induce changes in plant physiology that in turn affect interactions with herbivorous insects. We evaluated whether the application of entomopathogenic fungi &lt;i&gt;Beauveria bassiana&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium brunneum&lt;/i&gt; to soybean seeds could become endophytic and affect interactions with soybean aphid (&lt;i&gt;Aphis glycines&lt;/i&gt; Matsumura). It was found that &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glycines&lt;/i&gt; population sizes increased on plants with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;brunneum&lt;/i&gt; (strain F52) seed inoculum, but no significant effects were shown with analogous treatments with &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; (strain GHA). Fungi recovered from soybean plant tissues indicate that endophytism was established, and that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; was more prevalent. &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium brunneum&lt;/i&gt; was only recovered from stems, but &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; was recovered from stems and leaves. This work confirms that some entomopathogenic fungi can be endophytic in soybean, however, some of these fungi may have a negative effect on the plants by increasing susceptibility of soybean to &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glycines&lt;/i&gt;. We also used DNA sequence data to identify species of &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium&lt;/i&gt; obtained from agricultural fields in Iowa. Phylogenetic analyses, based on DNA sequence data, found that all isolates were &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium robertsii&lt;/i&gt;, which is consistent with past studies indicating a cosmopolitan distribution and wide host range for this species. These results are important for understanding the dynamics of implementing environmentally sustainable measures for the control of pest insects.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eric H.

&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-TRODAT-1 is a type of drug that can bind to dopamine transporters in living organisms and is often used in SPCT imaging for observation of changes in the activity uptake of dopamine in the striatum. Therefore, it is currently widely used in studies on clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and movement-related disorders. In conventional &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT image evaluation, visual inspection or manual selection of ROI for semiquantitative analysis is mainly used to observe and evaluate the degree of striatal defects. However, these methods are dependent on the subjective opinions of observers, which lead to human errors, have shortcomings such as long duration, increased effort, and have low reproducibility. To solve this problem, this study aimed to establish an automatic semiquantitative analytical method for &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-TRODAT-1. This method combines three drug templates (one built-in SPECT template in SPM software and two self-generated MRI-based and HMPAO-based TRODAT-1 templates) for the semiquantitative analysis of the striatal phantom and clinical images. At the same time, the results of automatic analysis of the three templates were compared with results from a conventional manual analysis for examining the feasibility of automatic analysis and the effects of drug templates on automatic semiquantitative analysis results. After comparison, it was found that the MRI-based TRODAT-1 template generated from MRI images is the most suitable template for &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-TRODAT-1 automatic semiquantitative analysis.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cheng-Han Wu, Bang-Hung Yang, Yuan-Hwa Chou, Shyh-Jen Wang, Jyh-Cheng Chen&lt;/p&gt;

The catastrophic misinterpretation model of panic disorder (PD) predicts that the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations is a distinctive characteristic of PD. Existing research on this prediction has produced mixed findings. This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the strength of catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations and external events in patients with PD, patients with other anxiety disorders, and healthy controls. Following a systematic screening, seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. For the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations, analyses showed medium to large effects between patients with PD and healthy controls and between patients with PD and patients with other anxiety disorders. For the catastrophic misinterpretation of external events, analyses showed medium to large effects between patients with PD and healthy controls and a small negative effect between patients with PD and patients with other anxiety disorders. The findings support the assumption that the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations is a distinctive characteristic of panic disorder and thus lend support to the catastrophic misinterpretation model of PD.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Barnabas Ohst, Brunna Tuschen-Caffier&lt;/p&gt;

Since the rapid development of high throughput sequencing technologies, it is cheap to get the low coverage data of whole genome, which is enough to assemble a complete chloroplast genome. To date, there are many assembly processes/pipelines described to assemble a complete chloroplast genome. In this study, we reported a simple and fast procedure to assemble a circular chloroplast genome using GetOrganelle pipeline. Findings: The GetOrganelle pipeline consists of four steps: 1) recruiting plastid-like reads; 2) de novo assembly using SPAdes; 3) filtering plastid-like contigs; and 4) visualizing and editing de novo assembly graph. Of them, the first three steps can be fulfilled automatically just using a combined command; and the fourth step is to visualize and evaluate the assemblies. Of 57 tested species with public datasets, we directly reassembled the circular chloroplast genome in 47 species. The eight non-circular species having break points, which may be caused by mononucleotide or dinonucleotide repeats, or small reads pool. In addition, we successfully assembled the circular chloroplast genome for the other 903 species of angiosperms using this pipeline, representing 41 families and 358 genera. Conclusion: The GetOrganelle pipeline is an effective way for land plants to assemble the circular chloroplast genome, without needs for reference-guided scaffolding, gap filling nor start-end point closing. This pipeline can be also applied to assemble mitochondrial genomes and nuclear Ribosomal DNAs using genome skimming data.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Chloroplast genes and genomes are the most important genomic data for plant phylogeny and DNA barcoding.

Moreover, the spectra exhibit different connections to various dopant types and positions: the graphitic‐type dopant species present large variety in absorption profiles, while the pyridinic‐type ones show extraordinary uniform stability and spectra independent of dopant positions/numbers and hence are hardly distinguishable from each other. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521442800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><unread>False</unread><title>Biomimetic artificial organelles with in vitro and in vivo activity triggered by reduction in microenvironment</title><engagement>9</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03560-x</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1623dbe2af3:25bcb49:9f3b30f2</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03560-x</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/M-yF63Zag-k/s41467-018-03560-x</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>49bba5c0</fingerprint><author><name>T.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Influenza vaccination can prevent influenza and potentially serious influenza-related complications. Although the single best way to prevent influenza is annual vaccination, everyday preventive actions, including good hygiene, health, dietary, and social habits, might help, too. Several preventive measures are recommended, including: avoiding close contact with people who are sick; staying home when sick; covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing; washing your hands often; avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; and practicing other good health habits like cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, getting plenty of sleep, and drinking plenty of fluids. Understanding public acceptance and current usage of these preventive behaviors can be useful for planning both seasonal and pandemic influenza prevention campaigns. This study estimated the percentage of adults in the United States who reported practicing preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza, and explored associations of reported behaviors with sociodemographic factors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from 2015 National Internet Flu Survey, a nationally representative probability-based Internet panel survey of the non-institutionalized U.S. population ≥18 years. The self-reported behaviors used to avoid catching or spreading influenza were grouped into four and three non-mutually exclusive subgroups, respectively. Weighted proportions were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted prevalence differences and to determine independent associations between sociodemographic characteristics and preventive behavior subgroups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Common preventive behaviors reported were: 83.2% wash hands often, 80.0% cover coughs and sneezes, 78.2% stay home if sick with a respiratory illness, 64.4% avoid people sick with a respiratory illness, 51.7% use hand sanitizers, 50.2% get treatment as soon as possible, and 49.8% report getting the influenza vaccination. Race/ethnicity, gender, age, education, income, region, receipt of influenza vaccination, and household size were associated with use of preventive behaviors after controlling for other factors.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Many adults in the United States reported using preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza. Though vaccination is the most important tool available to prevent influenza, the addition of preventive behaviors might play an effective role in reducing or slowing transmission of influenza and complement prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anup Srivastav, Tammy A.

They have been applied in various biological contexts, including gene regulatory networks and protein-protein interactions inference. Generally, learning Bayesian networks from experimental data is NP-hard, leading to widespread use of heuristic search methods giving suboptimal results. However, in cases when the acyclicity of the graph can be externally ensured, it is possible to find the optimal network in polynomial time. While our previously developed tool BNFinder implements polynomial time algorithm, reconstructing networks with the large amount of experimental data still leads to computations on single CPU growing exceedingly. Results: In the present paper we propose parallelized algorithm designed for multi-core and distributed systems and its implementation in the improved version of BNFinder - tool for learning optimal Bayesian networks. The new algorithm has been tested on different simulated and experimental datasets showing that it has much better efficiency of parallelization than the previous version. BNFinder gives comparable results in terms of accuracy with respect to current state-of-the-art inference methods, giving significant advantage in cases when external information such as regulators list or prior edge probability can be introduced. Conclusions: We show that the new method can be used to reconstruct networks in the size range of thousands of genes making it practically applicable to whole genome datasets of prokaryotic systems and large components of eukaryotic genomes. Our benchmarking results on realistic datasets indicate that the tool should be useful to wide audience of researchers interested in discovering dependencies in their large-scale transcriptomic datasets.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphical models widely used to represent the probabilistic relationships between random variables.

BNFinder gives comparable results in terms of accuracy with respect to current state-of-the-art inference methods, giving significant advantage in cases when external information such as regulators list or prior edge probability can be introduced. Conclusions: We show that the new method can be used to reconstruct networks in the size range of thousands of genes making it practically applicable to whole genome datasets of prokaryotic systems and large components of eukaryotic genomes. Our benchmarking results on realistic datasets indicate that the tool should be useful to wide audience of researchers interested in discovering dependencies in their large-scale transcriptomic datasets.</content></content></item><item><published>1521702000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-03523-2/MediaObjects/41467_2018_3523_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height><width>571</width></visual><unread>False</unread><title>An AP-MS- and BioID-compatible MAC-tag enables comprehensive mapping of protein interactions and subcellular localizations</title><engagement>3</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03523-2</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1624d3d0584:3d95f2c:34f43e70</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03523-2</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/NmjJuyblx-w/s41467-018-03523-2</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>8d2c173c</fingerprint><author><name>Xiaonan Liu</name></author><crawled>1521714267524</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03523-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An AP-MS- and BioID-compatible MAC-tag enables comprehensive mapping of protein interactions and subcellular localizations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AP-MS- and BioID-compatible MAC-tag enables comprehensive mapping of protein interactions and subcellular localizations, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03523-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03523-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;AP-MS and BioID provide complementary insights into cellular protein interaction networks.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness which is ultimately fatal, most often due to involvement of the diaphragm. Macrophage infiltration of dystrophic muscles has been strongly linked to muscle damage and fibrosis in DMD. We hypothesized that cenicriviroc (CVC), a dual chemokine receptor (CCR2/CCR5) antagonist currently under clinical evaluation for other diseases, could prevent macrophage accumulation and blunt disease progression in the diaphragms of mdx mice (genetic homologue of DMD). Treatment with CVC (20 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally) or vehicle was initiated in mdx mice at 2 weeks of age (prior to the onset of muscle necrosis) and continued for 4 weeks. Flow cytometry to assess inflammatory cell subsets as well as histological and force generation parameters were determined in mdx diaphragms at the conclusion of the treatment. CVC therapy induced a major (3.9-fold) reduction in total infiltrating macrophages, whereas total numbers of neutrophils and T lymphocytes (CD4+ and CD8+) were unaffected. No changes in macrophage polarization status (inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory skewing based on iNOS and CD206 expression) were observed. Muscle fiber size and fibrosis were not altered by CVC, whereas a significant reduction in centrally nucleated fibers was found suggesting a decrease in prior necrosis-regeneration cycles. In addition, maximal isometric force production by the diaphragm was increased by CVC therapy. These results suggest that CVC or other chemokine receptor antagonists which reduce pathological macrophage infiltration may have the potential to slow disease progression in DMD.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Feng Liang, Christian Giordano, Dong Shang, Qian Li, Basil J.

Social exclusion is a painful experience that is felt as a threat to the human need to belong and can lead to increased aggressive and anti-social behaviours, and results in emotional and cognitive numbness. Excluded individuals also seem to show an automatic tuning to positivity: they tend to increase their selective attention towards social acceptance signals. Despite these effects known in the literature, the consequences of social exclusion on social information processing still need to be explored in depth. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of social exclusion on processing two features that are strictly bound in the appraisal of the meaning of facial expressions: gaze direction and emotional expression. In two experiments (N = 60, N = 45), participants were asked to identify gaze direction or emotional expressions from facial stimuli, in which both these features were manipulated. They performed these tasks in a four-block crossed design after being socially included or excluded using the Cyberball game. Participants’ empathy and self-reported emotions were recorded using the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and PANAS questionnaires. The Need Threat Scale and three additional questions were also used as manipulation checks in the second experiment. In both experiments, excluded participants showed to be less accurate than included participants in gaze direction discrimination. Modulatory effects of direct gaze (Experiment 1) and sad expression (Experiment 2) on the effects of social exclusion were found on response times (RTs) in the emotion recognition task. Specific differences in the reaction to social exclusion between males and females were also found in Experiment 2: excluded male participants tended to be less accurate and faster than included male participants, while excluded females showed a more accurate and slower performance than included female participants. No influence of social exclusion on PANAS or EQ scores was found. Results are discussed in the context of the importance of identifying gaze direction in appraisal theories.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Bossi, Marcello Gallucci, Paola Ricciardelli&lt;/p&gt;

Vibrations are important cues for tactile perception across species. Whisker-based sensation in mice is a powerful model system for investigating mechanisms of tactile perception. However, the role vibration plays in whisker-based sensation remains unsettled, in part due to difficulties in modeling the vibration of whiskers. Here, we develop an analytical approach to calculate the vibrations of whiskers striking objects. We use this approach to quantify vibration forces during active whisker touch at a range of locations along the whisker. The frequency and amplitude of vibrations evoked by contact are strongly dependent on the position of contact along the whisker. The magnitude of vibrational shear force and bending moment is comparable to quasi-static forces. The fundamental vibration frequencies are in a detectable range for mechanoreceptor properties and below the maximum spike rates of primary sensory afferents. These results suggest two dynamic cues exist that rodents can use for object localization: vibration frequency and comparison of vibrational to quasi-static force magnitude. These complement the use of quasi-static force angle as a distance cue, particularly for touches close to the follicle, where whiskers are stiff and force angles hardly change during touch. Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oRjfKRlw_io&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Vaxenburg, Isis Wyche, Karel Svoboda, Alexander L.

Extension to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), metallocycles or supramolecules, such as catenanes, would be straightforward.

For CyberKnife-mediated prostate cancer treatment, a tumour-tracking approach is applied to correct the target location by acquiring X-ray images of implanted fiducial markers intermittently. This study investigated the dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion during CyberKnife treatment. We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients treated using the CyberKnife (35 Gy delivered in five fractions). Using log files of recorded prostate motion, the intra-fraction prostate motion was simulated. We defined the worst-case intra-fraction prostate motion as the difference between pre- and post-deviation on log files and shifted structure sets according to the corresponding offsets for each beam. The dose–volume indices were calculated and compared with the original plan in terms of clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (CTV plus a 2-mm margin), rectum, bladder, and urethra. Prostate motions of &gt;3, &gt;5, and &gt;10 mm were observed for 31.3, 9.1, and 0.5% of the 1929 timestamps, respectively. Relative differences between the simulated and original plans were mostly less than 1%. Although significant decreases were observed in D&lt;sub&gt;50%&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;98%&lt;/sub&gt; of the target, absolute dose differences were &amp;lt;0.1 Gy compared with the planned dose. The dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion may be small even with longer treatment durations, indicating that the tumour tracking using the CyberKnife could be a robust system for examining prostate motion.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuhei Koike, Iori Sumida, Hirokazu Mizuno, Hiroya Shiomi, Keita Kurosu, Seiichi Ota, Yasuo Yoshioka, Osamu Suzuki, Keisuke Tamari, Kazuhiko Ogawa&lt;/p&gt;

Nevertheless, the degree of conservation in regulatory mechanism is lower than that of expression, suggesting that distinct regulation may underlie some of the conserved transcriptional responses.</content></content></item><item><published>1522738004000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Note: Formation of the nematic splay-bend in two-dimensional systems of bow-shaped particles</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021541?af=R</originId><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b49:7c9981b6</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021541?af=R</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>6df83cd1</fingerprint><author><name>Paweł Karbowniczek</name></author><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021541?af=R</link><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1520899200000</published><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><unread>False</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/&quot;&gt;Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology&lt;/a&gt;, we published a Registered Report (Repass et al., 2016), that described how we intended to replicate an experiment from the paper ‘&lt;i&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; infection is prevalent in human colorectal carcinoma’ (Castellarin et al., 2012).

To ensure optimal calcium accrual in the fetal skeleton, a substantial rise occurs in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D), but is dependent on sufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D). Large longitudinal studies addressing free 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D during pregnancy are scarce. We aimed to assess levels of and relationship between 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and free 25(OH)D during pregnancy; determinants of vitamin D status; and association between vitamin D indices or PTH and pregnancy outcomes (gestational diabetes mellitus and birthweight). Altogether 855 pregnant Norwegian Caucasian women from Trondheim and Stavanger (latitude 63°N and 58°N) were recruited; 94 were lost to follow-up. The study was originally a randomized controlled trial (2007–2009) with gestational diabetes as primary outcome. Data were collected in second and third trimester. In third trimester, 246 (34%) had vitamin D insufficiency and 52 (7%) deficiency (25(OH)D &amp;lt;50 and &amp;lt;30nmol/L, respectively). During wintertime in third trimester, 61 (47%) from Trondheim and 23 (51%) from Stavanger exhibited vitamin D insufficiency. PTH was elevated in 27 (3.7%). Estimate of change between trimesters was (95% CI): 25(OH)D -1.8 (-2.8 to -0.7) nmol/L, DBP 0.62 (0.57 to 0.66) μmol/L, calculated free 25(OH)D -1.7 (-2.0 to -1.4) pmol/L, PTH 0.81 (0.72 to 0.90) pmol/L, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D (sub-analysis) 31.4 (CI 24.7 to 38.2) pmol/L. A decrease in 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D occurred in 45% of those with vitamin D deficiency, and they also exhibited lower levels than women with adequate vitamin D status. No association of vitamin D indices and PTH with pregnancy outcomes was observed. Women in Trondheim displayed lower 25(OH)D levels, despite minor latitudinal differences. Less than one-fifth adhered to the authorities’ vitamin D recommendations. These findings demonstrate that hypovitaminosis D is prevalent among pregnant women living in northern latitudes, especially during the dark season, and there is an unmet need to ensure adequate vitamin D intake.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miriam K.

Cell signaling is the process by which extracellular information is transmitted into the cell to perform useful biological functions. The ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) signaling controls several cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The ERK signaling pathway considered in this work starts with an extracellular stimulus and ends with activated (double phosphorylated) ERK which gets translocated into the nucleus. We model and analyze this complex pathway by decomposing it into three functional subsystems. The first subsystem spans the initial part of the pathway from the extracellular growth factor to the formation of the SOS complex, ShC-Grb2-SOS. The second subsystem includes the activation of Ras which is mediated by the SOS complex. This is followed by the MAPK subsystem (or the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) which produces the double phosphorylated ERK upon being activated by Ras. Although separate models exist in the literature at the subsystems level, a comprehensive model for the complete system including the important regulatory feedback loops is missing. Our dynamic model combines the existing subsystem models and studies their steady-state and dynamic interactions under feedback. We establish conditions under which bistability and oscillations exist for this important pathway. In particular, we show how the negative and positive feedback loops affect the dynamic characteristics that determine the cellular outcome.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yaman Arkun, Mohammadreza Yasemi&lt;/p&gt;

Unrecognized endobronchial intubation frequently occurs after emergency intubation. However, no study has evaluated the effect of one-lung ventilation on end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We compared the hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during one-lung ventilation with those during conventional two-lung ventilation in a pig model of CPR, to determine the effect of the former on ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A randomized crossover study was conducted in 12 pigs intubated with double-lumen endobronchial tube to achieve lung separation. During CPR, the animals underwent three 5-min ventilation trials based on a randomized crossover design: left-lung, right-lung, or two-lung ventilation. Arterial blood gases were measured at the end of each ventilation trial. Ventilation was provided using the same tidal volume throughout the ventilation trials. Comparison using generalized linear mixed model revealed no significant group effects with respect to aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and carotid blood flow; however, significant group effect in terms of ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In the post hoc analyses, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was lower during the right-lung ventilation than during the two-lung (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) or left-lung ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). However, no difference in ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was detected between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and oxygen saturation (SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) differed among the three types of ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, respectively). The post hoc analyses revealed a higher PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, lower PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and lower SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during right-lung ventilation than during two-lung or left-lung ventilation. However, the levels of these blood gases did not differ between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. In a pig model of CPR, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was significantly lower during right-lung ventilation than during two-lung ventilation.

Conformational adaptations of these proteins induced by their microenvironments lead to 46 different conformers that assemble into a massive quasisymmetric shell, exemplifying the structural and functional complexity of HSV.&lt;/p&gt;</description><keywords><item>Biochemistry, Online Only</item></keywords></item><item><published>1523554636000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Silicon sheds its harmonicity</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fececb:34f43e70</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-b?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/167.2.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-b?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>cdf5466f</fingerprint><author><name>Grocholski, B.</name></author><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-b?rss=1</link></item><item><published>1521740378000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><title>The Cancer Immunotherapy Revolution</title><engagement>2445</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:4150403:9f3b30f2</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1344?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1344.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1344?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>24c940dc</fingerprint><author><name>Kelly, P.

Human protection policies require favorable risk–benefit judgments prior to launch of clinical trials. For phase I and II trials, evidence for such judgment often stems from preclinical efficacy studies (PCESs). We undertook a systematic investigation of application materials (investigator brochures [IBs]) presented for ethics review for phase I and II trials to assess the content and properties of PCESs contained in them. Using a sample of 109 IBs most recently approved at 3 institutional review boards based at German Medical Faculties between the years 2010–2016, we identified 708 unique PCESs. We then rated all identified PCESs for their reporting on study elements that help to address validity threats, whether they referenced published reports, and the direction of their results. Altogether, the 109 IBs reported on 708 PCESs. Less than 5% of all PCESs described elements essential for reducing validity threats such as randomization, sample size calculation, and blinded outcome assessment. For most PCESs (89%), no reference to a published report was provided. Only 6% of all PCESs reported an outcome demonstrating no effect. For the majority of IBs (82%), all PCESs were described as reporting positive findings. Our results show that most IBs for phase I/II studies did not allow evaluators to systematically appraise the strength of the supporting preclinical findings. The very rare reporting of PCESs that demonstrated no effect raises concerns about potential design or reporting biases. Poor PCES design and reporting thwart risk–benefit evaluation during ethical review of phase I/II studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Lvi8iDwsCE0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Wieschowski, William Wei Lim Chin, Carole Federico, Sören Sievers, Jonathan Kimmelman, Daniel Strech&lt;/p&gt;

Antimicrobial resistance against colistin has emerged worldwide threatening the efficacy of one of the last-resort antimicrobials used for the treatment of &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriacea&lt;/i&gt;e. To investigate the presence of the recently identified colistin resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt;) in China, we established PCRs to detect &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;5 on 213 anal and 1,339 nasal swabs from apparently healthy pigs (n = 1,454) in nine provinces, and 1,696 cloacal and 1,647 oropharyngeal samples from poultry (n = 1,836) at live-bird markets in 24 provinces of China. The prevalence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; in swine swabs (41.4%; 642/1,552) was significantly higher than in swabs from poultry (11.5%; 384/3,343). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; gene was found in geese (49.5%, 54/109), chickens (17.2%, 257/1,498), pigeons (17.2%, 17/99) and ducks (15.4%, 20/130). In a similar trend, the prevalence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; in swine swabs (33.1%; 514/1552) was significantly higher than in swabs from poultry (5.6%; 187/3,343). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; was identified in geese (17.4%, 19/109), chickens (9.9%, 148/1,498), ducks (7.7%, 10/130) and pigeons (3%, 3/99).

Antimicrobial resistance against colistin has emerged worldwide threatening the efficacy of one of the last-resort antimicrobials used for the treatment of &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriacea&lt;/i&gt;e. To investigate the presence of the recently identified colistin resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt;) in China, we established PCRs to detect &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;5 on 213 anal and 1,339 nasal swabs from apparently healthy pigs (n = 1,454) in nine provinces, and 1,696 cloacal and 1,647 oropharyngeal samples from poultry (n = 1,836) at live-bird markets in 24 provinces of China. The prevalence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; in swine swabs (41.4%; 642/1,552) was significantly higher than in swabs from poultry (11.5%; 384/3,343). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; gene was found in geese (49.5%, 54/109), chickens (17.2%, 257/1,498), pigeons (17.2%, 17/99) and ducks (15.4%, 20/130). In a similar trend, the prevalence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; in swine swabs (33.1%; 514/1552) was significantly higher than in swabs from poultry (5.6%; 187/3,343).

Graphic warnings (GWs) on cigarette packs are widely used internationally with the aim of reducing smoking behavior. In the current study, we investigated whether GWs influence implicit evaluations of smoking, a potential moderator of smoking behavior, as measured with an Implicit Association Test (IAT). Results showed that viewing a GW did not produce more negative implicit evaluations of smoking for daily smokers, occasional smokers, or non-smokers, compared to viewing a text-only warning. If anything, effects were in the direction of evaluations of smoking being &lt;i&gt;more positive&lt;/i&gt; after certain participants (i.e., daily and occasional smokers) viewed a GW. We also did not find any beneficial effects of GWs on explicit evaluations of smoking. These results contrast with the observation that non-smokers and occasional smokers (but not daily smokers) believed that GWs would be more effective than the text-only warnings. We discuss implications and limitations of these findings and provide recommendations for improving the effectiveness of cigarette pack warnings on implicit evaluations.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pieter Van Dessel, Colin Tucker Smith, Jan De Houwer&lt;/p&gt;

Endogenous nicotine was confirmed to be present in tea plants (&lt;i&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/i&gt; L.) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of tea samples from tea-producing regions in six Asian countries. All samples contained nicotine (0.011–0.694 μg g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dry weight). Nicotine contents remained constant during manufacturing of green, oolong and black teas, implying that nicotine is stable against heating, drying, enzymatic oxidation and mechanical damage during processing. Flower buds and seeds of cultivar Yabukita also contained nicotine (0.030–0.041 μg g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dry weight). A comparison of two cultivars revealed that higher nicotine contents were found in the black tea cultivar Benifuki. All plant parts of hydroponic Yabukita contained nicotine (0.003–0.013 μg g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dry weight). Tea cells cultured in B5 medium as well as roots and stems of tea seedlings contained nicotine levels similar to those of new leaves from field-grown plants.

However, compared to bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell expression profiles are extremely noisy, as they only capture a fraction of the transcripts present in the cell. Here, we propose the k-nearest neighbor smoothing (kNN-smoothing) algorithm, designed to reduce noise by aggregating information from similar cells (neighbors) in a computationally efficient and statistically tractable manner. The algorithm is based on the observation that across protocols, the technical noise exhibited by UMI-filtered scRNA-Seq data closely follows Poisson statistics. Smoothing is performed by first identifying the nearest neighbors of each cell in a step-wise fashion, based on partially smoothed and variance-stabilized expression profiles, and then aggregating their transcript counts. We show that kNN-smoothing greatly improves the detection of clusters of cells and co-expressed genes, and clearly outperforms other smoothing methods on simulated data. To accurately perform smoothing for datasets containing highly similar cell populations, we propose the kNN-smoothing 2 algorithm, in which neighbors are determined after projecting the partially smoothed data onto the first few principal components. We show that unlike its predecessor, kNN-smoothing 2 can accurately distinguish between cells from different T cell subsets, and enables their identification in peripheral blood using unsupervised methods. Our work facilitates the analysis of scRNA-Seq data across a broad range of applications, including the identification of cell populations in heterogeneous tissues and the characterization of dynamic processes such as cellular differentiation.

Thus, activity from nociceptors to DnB interneurons coordinates modular elements of nociceptive escape behavior.</description><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords></item><item><published>1520924400000</published><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><title>Author Correction: Whole-exome SNP array identifies 15 new susceptibility loci for psoriasis</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16186</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1621ee46b91:321450:9f3b30f2</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16186</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/gKRKndrU__s/ncomms16186</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>15cac83e</fingerprint><author><name>Xianbo Zuo</name></author><crawled>1520936709009</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16186</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Whole-exome SNP array identifies 15 new susceptibility loci for psoriasis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Whole-exome SNP array identifies 15 new susceptibility loci for psoriasis, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16186&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16186&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Whole-exome SNP array identifies 15 new susceptibility loci for psoriasis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/gKRKndrU__s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Whole-exome SNP array identifies 15 new susceptibility loci for psoriasis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Whole-exome SNP array identifies 15 new susceptibility loci for psoriasis, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16186&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16186&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Whole-exome SNP array identifies 15 new susceptibility loci for psoriasis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/gKRKndrU__s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522259407000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>[Research Articles] Ablation of the stress protease OMA1 protects against heart failure in mice</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/434/eaan4935?rss=1</originId><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1626dcdcf9e:6b9e6c6:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/434/eaan4935.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/434/eaan4935?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>4548b9a6</fingerprint><author><name>Acin-Perez, R., Lechuga-Vieco, A.

We evaluate three different mouse models of HF: tachycardiomyopathy, HF with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF), and LV myocardial ischemia and hypertrophy. Regardless of whether LVEF is preserved, our results indicate that the three models share common features: an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species followed by ultrastructural alterations in the mitochondrial cristae and loss of mitochondrial integrity that lead to cardiomyocyte death. We show that the ablation of the mitochondrial protease OMA1 averts cardiomyocyte death in all three murine HF models, and thus loss of OMA1 plays a direct role in cardiomyocyte protection.

Increased production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their widespread application in industrial and consumer products have led to a rise in the release of CNTs into the aquatic environment. CNTs have a very strong adsorption affinity for various environmental contaminants; therefore, they may also influence the toxic effects of other pollutants, such as toxic metals. In this study, the effect of two different functionalized carbon nanotubes, carboxylate and polyethyleneimine modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (C-MWCNTs and N-MWCNT, respectively) on lead toxicity and bioaccumulation was investigated with a freshwater zooplankton &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt;. The acute toxicity results indicate that the different surface properties of the two types of MWCNTs have different effects on lead toxicity to &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;magna&lt;/i&gt;. The negatively charged C-MWCNT showed a notable decrease in lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.08 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; C-MWCNT), whereas the positively charged N-MWCNT had only a slight effect on lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 0.16 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; N-MWCNT). The decrease of lead toxicity was related with the reduced bioavailability of free metal form (Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) caused by greater adsorption of lead onto the MWCNTs. The present study suggests that there is a need to consider carefully the complex interaction of CNTs with toxic metals in future ecotoxicological studies.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Min-Hee Jang, Yu Sik Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the retention and discontinuation reasons of seven biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in a real-world setting of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 1,037 treatment courses with bDMARDs from 2009 to 2016 [female, 81.8%; baseline age, 59.6 y; disease duration 7.8 y; rheumatoid factor positivity 81.5%; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), 4.4; concomitant prednisolone 43.5% and methotrexate 68.6%; Bio-naïve, 57.1%; abatacept (ABT), 21.3%; tocilizumab (TCZ), 20.7%; golimumab (GLM), 16.9%; etanercept (ETN), 13.6%; adalimumab (ADA), 11.1%; infliximab (IFX), 8.5%; certolizumab pegol (CZP), 7.9%] were included in this multi-center, retrospective study. Drug retention and discontinuation reasons at 36 months were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and adjusted by potent confounders using Cox proportional hazards modeling. As a result, 455 treatment courses (43.9%) were stopped, with 217 (20.9%) stopping due to inefficacy, 113 (10.9%) due to non-toxic reasons, 86 (8.3%) due to toxic adverse events, and 39 (3.8%) due to remission. Drug retention rates in the adjusted model were as follows: total retention (ABT, 60.7%; ADA, 32.7%; CZP, 43.3%; ETN, 51.9%; GLM, 45.4%; IFX, 31.1%; and TCZ, 59.2%; P &amp;lt; 0.001); inefficacy (ABT, 81.4%; ADA, 65.7%; CZP, 60.7%; ETN, 71.3%; GLM, 68.5%; IFX, 65.0%; and TCZ, 81.4%; P = 0.015), toxic adverse events (ABT, 89.8%; ADA, 80.5%; CZP, 83.9%; ETN, 89.2%; GLM, 85.5%; IFX, 75.6%; and TCZ, 77.2%; P = 0.50), and remission (ABT, 95.5%; ADA, 88.1%; CZP, 91.1%; ETN, 97.5%; GLM, 94.7%; IFX, 86.4%; and TCZ, 98.4%; P &amp;lt; 0.001).

In contrast, biological enzymes with Brønsted acidic sites of appropriate strength can protonate olefins and thereby generate carbocations that ultimately react to form natural products. Although chemists have recently designed chiral Brønsted acid catalysts to activate imines and carbonyl compounds, mimicking these enzymes to protonate simple olefins that then engage in asymmetric catalytic reactions has remained a substantial synthetic challenge.

In contrast, biological enzymes with Brønsted acidic sites of appropriate strength can protonate olefins and thereby generate carbocations that ultimately react to form natural products. Although chemists have recently designed chiral Brønsted acid catalysts to activate imines and carbonyl compounds, mimicking these enzymes to protonate simple olefins that then engage in asymmetric catalytic reactions has remained a substantial synthetic challenge. Here, we show that a class of confined and strong chiral Brønsted acids enables the catalytic asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of unbiased olefins.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;HIV-1 dual infection is a condition that results from infection with at least two HIV-1 variants from different sources. The scarceness of information on this condition is partly due to the fact that its detection is technically challenging. Using next-generation sequencing we defined the extent of HIV-1 dual infection in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM).&lt;/p&gt; Material &amp;amp; methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-six MSM, diagnosed with HIV-1 subtype B infection between 2008 and 2013 were selected for next-generation sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;envelope&lt;/i&gt; V3. Sequencing was performed on 2 plasma samples collected with an interval of &gt; 6 months before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inspected for dual infection, defined as the presence of two or more monophyletic clusters with ≥ 90% bootstrap support and a mean between-cluster genetic distance of ≥ 10%. To confirm dual infection, deep V3 sequencing of intermediate samples was performed as well as clonal sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;protease-reverse transcriptase&lt;/i&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five of the 74 patients (6.8%) for whom deep sequencing was successful, showed clear evidence of dual infection. In 4 of them, the second strain was absent in the first sample but occurred in subsequent samples. This was highly suggestive for superinfection. In 3 patients both virus variants were of subtype B, in 2 patients at least one of the variants was a subtype B/non-B recombinant virus.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Dual infection was confirmed in 6.8% of MSM diagnosed with HIV-1 in Belgium. This prevalence is probably an underestimation, because stringent criteria were used to classify viral variants as originating from a new infection event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Hebberecht, Leen Vancoillie, Marlies Schauvliege, Delfien Staelens, Kenny Dauwe, Virginie Mortier, Chris Verhofstede&lt;/p&gt;

Outbreaks affecting vaccinated individuals and communities with high vaccine coverage have prompted concerns about the effectiveness of the live attenuated vaccine currently in use. It is unclear whether immune protection wanes or whether the vaccine protects inadequately against currently circulating mumps virus lineages. Synthesizing data from six studies of mumps vaccine effectiveness, we estimated that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps wanes on average 27 years (95% confidence interval, 16 to 51 years) after vaccination. After accounting for this waning, we found no evidence that the emergence of heterologous virus genotypes contributed to changes in vaccine effectiveness over time. A mathematical model of mumps transmission confirmed the central role of waning immunity to the vaccine in the re-emergence of mumps cases. Outbreaks from 2006 to the present among young adults, and outbreaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s among adolescents, aligned with peaks in mumps susceptibility of these age groups predicted to be due to loss of vaccine-derived protection. In contrast, evolution of mumps virus strains escaping immune pressure would be expected to cause a higher proportion of cases among children, not adolescents and young adults as observed. Routine use of a third vaccine dose at 18 years of age, or booster dosing throughout adulthood, may be a strategy to prevent mumps re-emergence and should be assessed in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;After decades of declining mumps incidence amid widespread vaccination, the United States and other developed countries have experienced a resurgence in mumps cases over the last decade.

Single-trial analyses have the potential to uncover meaningful brain dynamics that are obscured when averaging across trials. However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75 Hz to 95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55 Hz to 125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oy2L5cnKlBc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Britta U.

Single-trial analyses have the potential to uncover meaningful brain dynamics that are obscured when averaging across trials. However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75 Hz to 95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55 Hz to 125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oy2L5cnKlBc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/oy2L5cnKlBc/article</href></item></alternate></item><item><published>1521567125000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/12.cover-source.jpg?itok=TO5q5WLS</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>480</height><width>359</width></visual><unread>False</unread><title>Uranium isotope evidence for two episodes of deoxygenation during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2918.short?rss=1</originId><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6bc:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2918</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2918.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>402fe24b</fingerprint><author><name>Matthew O.

The centrosome is a non–membrane-bound cellular compartment consisting of 2 centrioles surrounded by a protein coat termed the pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrioles generally remain physically associated together (a phenomenon called centrosome cohesion), yet how this occurs in the absence of a bounding lipid membrane is unclear. One model posits that pericentriolar fibres formed from rootletin protein directly link centrioles, yet little is known about the structure, biophysical properties, or assembly kinetics of such fibres. Here, I combine live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged rootletin with cell fusion and find previously unrecognised plasticity in centrosome cohesion. Rootletin forms large, diffusionally stable bifurcating fibres, which amass slowly on mature centrioles over many hours from anaphase. Nascent centrioles (procentrioles), in contrast, do not form roots and must be licensed to do so through polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) activity. Transient separation of roots accompanies centriolar repositioning during the interphase, suggesting that centrioles organize as independent units, each containing discrete roots. Indeed, forced induction of duplicate centriole pairs allows independent reshuffling of individual centrioles between the pairs. Therefore collectively, these findings suggest that progressively nucleated polymers mediate the dynamic association of centrioles as either 1 or 2 interphase centrosomes, with implications for the understanding of how non–membrane-bound organelles self-organise.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/44jiWSXqczI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Mahen&lt;/p&gt;

It is an absolute requirement that every time you write about graphene that you mention that the breakthrough in its isolation came from the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0218/230218-graphene-sticky-tape&quot;&gt;adhesive tape&lt;/a&gt;, a low-tech insight at Manchester that led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/&quot;&gt;Nobel&lt;/a&gt; and kicked off a massive field of research. The latest is that earlier this month, a group at MIT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02773-w&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that if you bring two graphene sheets together, parallel but at a slightly different rotational angle (about 1.1 degrees), that the system becomes a superconductor at low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was already unexpected, but the behavior of the material (electron density versus temperature) suggests some real similarities to the copper-oxide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity&quot;&gt;high-temperature superconductors&lt;/a&gt;, and no one saw that coming, either. (Note that “high temperature”, in this field, still means “can be reached in liquid nitrogen as opposed to liquid helium”). Despite a really impressive amount of theoretical and experimental work on the cuprate materials, the full details of their superconductivity are still a matter of debate. It seems to come down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair&quot;&gt;Cooper pairs&lt;/a&gt; (as with the classic low-temperature superconductors, but the mechanism of the electron pairing is different and in ways that still start arguments. This new graphene systems might be able to shed some light on the various proposals, and you can be certain that a great deal of late-night coffee has been consumed in recent weeks to come up with appropriate experiments along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical value of such an understanding could well be huge (and there is, of course, another near-certain Nobel in physics waiting for whoever puts the field on a firmer basis). To give another recent MIT-related example, new superconductor engineering is at the heart of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-newly-formed-company-launch-novel-approach-fusion-power-0309&quot;&gt;recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; the university made about fusion power. The belief is that large-bore magnets of such materials, which now appear feasible, could allow a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak&quot;&gt;tokamak&lt;/a&gt;-design fusion reactor that is far more compact than any previous attempts. Wrestling with the magnets is one of the biggest problems in designing such machines, because you need extremely strong, extremely homogeneous fields. The high-temperature superconductors were recognized early on as having great possibilities in this area, but the first fusion reactor that used only these materials only became operational in 2014 (a spherical tokamak design at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Tokamak Energy&lt;/a&gt; in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphene-layer materials are still operating at very low temperatures – but considering their electron density, it’s actually a lot higher than it should be. No one is going to be make fusion reactors with twisted-graphite magnets any time soon, but twisted graphite might possibly be the platform that leads us to the magnets that fusion reactors will use.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>I wanted to mention something on the border between chemistry and physics that might well turn out to be important.

Epileptic seizures are known to follow specific changes in brain dynamics. While some algorithms can nowadays robustly detect these changes, a clear understanding of the mechanism by which these alterations occur and generate seizures is still lacking. Here, we provide crossvalidated evidence that such changes are initiated by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically, our analysis of long intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from a group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which time-dependent network states become less variable (&amp;quot;degenerate&amp;quot;), and this phase is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset. This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly correlated network instances and is shown to be particularly associated with the activity of the resected regions in patients with validated postsurgical outcome. Our approach characterizes preseizure network dynamics as a cascade of 2 sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/DHVkBqQJLvk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Adrià Tauste Campo, Alessandro Principe, Miguel Ley, Rodrigo Rocamora, Gustavo Deco&lt;/p&gt;

We investigated the numbers of planktonic and biofilm cells and the expression levels of genes encoding efflux pumps and biofilm-related proteins in 10 clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; (MDRA) as well as in its standard strain ATCC 19606 in the presence of colistin (CST), polymyxin B (PMB), minomycin (MIN), and tigecycline (TGC) at their respective sub-MICs. The number of planktonic and biofilm cells of ATCC 19606 decreased in the presence of all aforementioned antibiotics in a dose-dependent manner. Cell number also decreased in two representative MDRA strains, R2 and R3, in the presence of MIN and TGC in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the number of biofilm cells in these two strains increased in the presence of CST, while they increased significantly in the presence of PMB in R2 only. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the number of biofilm cells was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding efflux pumps (&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;) and autoinducer synthase (&lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt;) in strain R2 and &lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeJ&lt;/i&gt;, poly-acetyl-glucosamine-porin (&lt;i&gt;pgaA&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt; in strain R3 in the presence of CST. It was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding &lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; in strain R2 and an outer membrane protein A (&lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt;) and biofilm-associated protein (&lt;i&gt;bap)&lt;/i&gt; in strain R3 in the presence of PMB. These results provide valuable insights into the biofilm formation potency of clinical isolates of MDRA that depends on efflux pumps and biofilm-related genes and its regulation by antibiotics.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yoshinori Sato, Yuka Unno, Tsuneyuki Ubagai, Yasuo Ono&lt;/p&gt;
We investigated the numbers of planktonic and biofilm cells and the expression levels of genes encoding efflux pumps and biofilm-related proteins in 10 clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; (MDRA) as well as in its standard strain ATCC 19606 in the presence of colistin (CST), polymyxin B (PMB), minomycin (MIN), and tigecycline (TGC) at their respective sub-MICs. The number of planktonic and biofilm cells of ATCC 19606 decreased in the presence of all aforementioned antibiotics in a dose-dependent manner. Cell number also decreased in two representative MDRA strains, R2 and R3, in the presence of MIN and TGC in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the number of biofilm cells in these two strains increased in the presence of CST, while they increased significantly in the presence of PMB in R2 only. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the number of biofilm cells was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding efflux pumps (&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;) and autoinducer synthase (&lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt;) in strain R2 and &lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeJ&lt;/i&gt;, poly-acetyl-glucosamine-porin (&lt;i&gt;pgaA&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt; in strain R3 in the presence of CST. It was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding &lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; in strain R2 and an outer membrane protein A (&lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt;) and biofilm-associated protein (&lt;i&gt;bap)&lt;/i&gt; in strain R3 in the presence of PMB.

Although methods to detect rhythmicity in genome-scale data are well established, methods to detect changes in rhythmicity or in average expression between experimental conditions are often ad hoc. Here we present LimoRhyde (linear models for rhythmicity, design), a flexible approach for analyzing transcriptome data from circadian systems. Borrowing from cosinor regression, LimoRhyde decomposes circadian or zeitgeber time into multiple components, in order to fit a linear model to the expression of each gene. The linear model can accommodate any number of additional experimental variables, whether discrete or continuous, making it straightforward to detect differential rhythmicity and differential expression using state-of-the-art methods for analyzing microarray and RNA-seq data. In this approach, differential rhythmicity corresponds to a statistical interaction between an experimental variable and circadian time, whereas differential expression corresponds to the main effect of an experimental variable while accounting for circadian time. To demonstrate LimoRhyde&apos;s versatility, we applied it to murine and human circadian transcriptome datasets acquired under various experimental designs. Our results show how LimoRhyde systematizes the analysis of such data, and suggest that LimoRhyde could become a valuable approach for assessing how circadian systems respond to genetic and environmental perturbations.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>As experiments to interrogate circadian rhythms increase in scale and complexity, methods to analyze the resulting data must keep pace.

The ability to concentrate immunostimulatory compounds at the site of disease can overcome local immune tolerance and reduce systemic toxicity. Surgical resection of tumors may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy by removing the concentrated immunosuppressive microenvironment; however, it also removes tumor-specific leukocytes as well as tumor antigens that may be important to establishing antitumor immunity. Moreover, surgery produces a transient immunosuppressive state associated with wound healing that has been correlated with increased metastasis. Using multiple models of spontaneous metastasis, we show that extended release of agonists of innate immunity—including agonists of Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) or stimulator of interferon genes (STING)—from a biodegradable hydrogel placed in the tumor resection site cured a much higher percentage of animals than systemic or local administration of the same therapy in solution. Depletion and neutralization experiments confirmed that the observed prevention of local tumor recurrence and eradication of existing metastases require both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The localized therapy increased the numbers of activated natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and T cells and induced production of large amounts of type I interferons, thereby converting an immunosuppressive post-resection microenvironment into an immunostimulatory one. The results suggest that the perioperative setting may prove to be a useful context for immunotherapy, particularly when the release of the therapy is extended locally.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Cancer immunotherapy can confer durable benefit, but the percentage of patients who respond to this approach remains modest.

Scant research is available on the impact of the current economic crisis and austerity policies on inequality in health services utilisation in Europe. This study aimed to describe the trends in horizontal inequity in the use of health services in Andalusia, Spain, during the early years of the Great Recession, and the contribution of demographic, economic and social factors. Consultation with a general practitioner (GP) and specialist, hospitalisation and emergency care were studied through the Andalusian Health Survey 2007 (pre-crisis) and 2011–2012 (crisis), using a composite income index as socioeconomic status (SES) indicator. Horizontal inequity indices (HII) were calculated to take differential healthcare needs into account, and a decomposition analysis of change in inequality between periods was performed. Results showed that before the crisis, the HII was positive (greater access for people with higher SES) for specialist visits but negative (greater access for people with lower SES) in the other three utilisation models. During the crisis no change was observed in inequalities in GP visits, but a pro-poor development was seen for the other types of utilisation, with hospital and emergency care showing significant inequality in favour of low income groups. Overall, the main contributors to pro-poor changes in utilisation were socio-economic variables and poor mental health, due to changes in their elasticities. Our findings show that inequalities in healthcare utilisation largely remained in favour of the less well-off, despite the cuts in welfare benefits and health services provision during the early years of the recession in Andalusia. Further research is needed to monitor the potential impact of such measures in subsequent years.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Antonio Córdoba-Doña, Antonio Escolar-Pujolar, Miguel San Sebastián, Per E.

In this study, we investigated: i) the effects of bed rest and a subsequent physical training program on metabolic cost (Cw), mechanical work and efficiency during walking in older and young men; ii) the mechanisms underlying the higher Cw observed in older than young men.Twenty-three healthy male subjects (N = 16 older adults, age 59.6±3.4 years; N = 7 young, age: 23.1±2.9 years) participated in this study. The subjects underwent 14 days of bed rest followed by two weeks of physical training (6 sessions). Cw, mechanical work, efficiency, and co-contraction time of proximal muscles (vastus lateralis and biceps femoris) and distal muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and tibialis anterior) were measured during walking at 0.83, 1.11, 1.39, 1.67 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; before bed rest (pre-BR), after bed rest (post-BR) and after physical training (post-PT).No effects of bed rest and physical training were observed on the analysed parameters in either group. Older men showed higher Cw and lower efficiency at each speed (average +25.1 and -20.5%, P&amp;lt;0.001, respectively) compared to young. Co-contraction time of proximal and distal muscles were higher in older than in young men across the different walking speeds (average +30.0 and +110.3%, P&amp;lt;0.05, respectively).The lack of bed rest and physical training effects on the parameters analyzed in this study may be explained by the healthy status of both young and older men, which could have mitigated the effects of these interventions on walking motor function. On the other hand, the fact that older adults showed greater Cw, overall higher co-contraction time of antagonist lower limb muscles, and lower efficiency compared to the young cohort throughout a wide range of walking speed may suggest that older adults sacrificed economy of walking to improve stability.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mirco Floreani, Enrico Rejc, Paolo Taboga, Alessandro Ganzini, Rado Pišot, Bostjan Šimunič, Gianni Biolo, Carlo Reggiani, Angelina Passaro, Marco Narici, Joern Rittweger, Pietro Enrico di Prampero, Stefano Lazzer&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We investigated whether polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt;, or in the autoinflammatory &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; genes, concur with &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; in enhancing the risk of Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and/or in predicting the response to anti-TNFα treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;373 controls and 137 SpA (82 with Psoriatic Arthritis-PsA and 55 with Ankylosing Spondylitis- AS; 98/137 under TNFα inhibitor therapy) from the Veneto Region (Italy) were studied. &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms (-1031T&gt;C;-857C&gt;T;-376G&gt;A;-308G&gt;A;-238G&gt;A) and &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; were assayed by RT-PCR. Direct sequencing of &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; (exons 2,3,5 and 10) and &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; (exons 2,3,4 and 6) genes were performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; was associated with AS (χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 120.1; p = 0.000). Only the &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; -1031T&gt;C was singly associated with SpA, and the haplotype C/G, resulting from -1031T&gt;C/-308G&gt;A combination, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of SpA (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.46–0.97; p = 0.035). Two SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt;, the R92Q (Minor allele frequency-MAF = 0.034) and c.625+10A&gt;G (MAF = 0.479). None of them was associated with SpA (p&gt;0.05). The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFα therapy (p = 0.031). Twenty-one SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene, 10 with a known potential functional significance. Variant alleles were extremely rare in our population (MAF&amp;lt;0.025) except for R202Q (MAF = 0.27). None was associated with SpA diagnosis (p&gt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene SNPs are not associated with SpA in the North-East of Italy. AS risk appears to depend not only on &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt;, but also on the protective &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; haplotype -1031C/-308G. The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10A&gt;G impacts on the response to anti-TNFα therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ada Aita, Daniela Basso, Roberta Ramonda, Stefania Moz, Mariagrazia Lorenzin, Filippo Navaglia, Carlo-Federico Zambon, Andrea Padoan, Mario Plebani, Leonardo Punzi&lt;/p&gt;
Objectives &lt;p&gt;We investigated whether polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt;, or in the autoinflammatory &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; genes, concur with &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; in enhancing the risk of Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and/or in predicting the response to anti-TNFα treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;373 controls and 137 SpA (82 with Psoriatic Arthritis-PsA and 55 with Ankylosing Spondylitis- AS; 98/137 under TNFα inhibitor therapy) from the Veneto Region (Italy) were studied. &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms (-1031T&gt;C;-857C&gt;T;-376G&gt;A;-308G&gt;A;-238G&gt;A) and &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; were assayed by RT-PCR. Direct sequencing of &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; (exons 2,3,5 and 10) and &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; (exons 2,3,4 and 6) genes were performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; was associated with AS (χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 120.1; p = 0.000). Only the &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; -1031T&gt;C was singly associated with SpA, and the haplotype C/G, resulting from -1031T&gt;C/-308G&gt;A combination, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of SpA (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.46–0.97; p = 0.035). Two SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt;, the R92Q (Minor allele frequency-MAF = 0.034) and c.625+10A&gt;G (MAF = 0.479). None of them was associated with SpA (p&gt;0.05). The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFα therapy (p = 0.031). Twenty-one SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene, 10 with a known potential functional significance. Variant alleles were extremely rare in our population (MAF&amp;lt;0.025) except for R202Q (MAF = 0.27). None was associated with SpA diagnosis (p&gt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene SNPs are not associated with SpA in the North-East of Italy. AS risk appears to depend not only on &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt;, but also on the protective &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; haplotype -1031C/-308G. The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10A&gt;G impacts on the response to anti-TNFα therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522047600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>The RNA-binding protein ARPP21 controls dendritic branching by functionally opposing the miRNA it hosts</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03681-3</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16261a10c4d:5957e55:9f3b30f2</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03681-3</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/HoMiPtqFphI/s41467-018-03681-3</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>a518a267</fingerprint><author><name>Frederick Rehfeld</name></author><crawled>1522056367181</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03681-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The RNA-binding protein ARPP21 controls dendritic branching by functionally opposing the miRNA it hosts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RNA-binding protein ARPP21 controls dendritic branching by functionally opposing the miRNA it hosts, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03681-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03681-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Many microRNA encoding regions are within introns of other coding genes, and yet the molecular or functional interaction between the two is unclear.

Background &lt;p&gt;Few studies have investigated the difference in bacterial contamination between conventional reused ventilator systems and disposable closed ventilator-suction systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial contamination rates of the reused and disposable ventilator systems, and the association between system disconnection and bacterial contamination of ventilator systems.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The enrolled intubated and mechanically ventilated patients used a conventional reused ventilator system and a disposable closed ventilator-suction system, respectively, for a week; specimens were then collected from the ventilator circuit systems to evaluate human and environmental bacterial contamination. The sputum specimens from patients were also analyzed in this study.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The detection rate of bacteria in the conventional reused ventilator system was substantially higher than that in the disposable ventilator system. The inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the disposable closed ventilator-suction system had higher bacterial concentrations than the conventional reused ventilator system. The bacterial concentration in the heated humidifier of the reused ventilator system was significantly higher than that in the disposable ventilator system. Positive associations existed among the bacterial concentrations at different locations in the reused and disposable ventilator systems, respectively. The predominant bacteria identified in the reused and disposable ventilator systems included &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter spp&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Elizabethkingia spp&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas spp&lt;/i&gt;., and &lt;i&gt;Stenotrophomonas (Xan) maltophilia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Both the reused and disposable ventilator systems had high bacterial contamination rates after one week of use. Disconnection of the ventilator systems should be avoided during system operation to decrease the risks of environmental pollution and human exposure, especially for the disposable ventilator system.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov PRS / NCT03359148&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ya-Chi Li, Hui-Ling Lin, Fang-Chun Liao, Sing-Siang Wang, Hsiu-Chu Chang, Hung-Fu Hsu, Sue-Hsien Chen, Gwo-Hwa Wan&lt;/p&gt;

The human amniotic membrane (HAM) is widely used for its wound healing effect in clinical practice, as a feeder for the cell cultivation, or a source of cells to be used in cell therapy. The aim of this study was to find effective and safe enzymatic HAM de-epithelialization method leading to harvesting of both denuded undamaged HAM and viable human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs). The efficiency of de-epithelialization using TrypLE Express, trypsin/ ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), and thermolysin was monitored by hematoxylin and eosin staining and by the measurement of DNA concentration. The cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. Scanning electron microscopy and immunodetection of collagen type IV and laminin α5 chain were used to check the basement membrane integrity. De-epithelialized hAECs were cultured and their stemness properties and proliferation potential was assessed after each passage. The HAM was successfully de-epithelialized using all three types of reagents, but morphological changes in basement membrane and stroma were observed after the thermolysin application. About 60% of cells remained viable using trypsin/EDTA, approximately 6% using TrypLE Express, and all cells were lethally damaged after thermolysin application. The hAECs isolated using trypsin/EDTA were successfully cultured up to the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; passage with increasing proliferation potential and decreased stem cell markers expression (&lt;i&gt;NANOG&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOX2&lt;/i&gt;) in prolonged cell culture.

The speed of theta brain oscillatory activity is thought to play a key role in determining working memory (WM) capacity. Individual differences in the length of a theta cycle (ranging between 4 and 7 Hz) might determine how many gamma cycles (&gt;30 Hz) can be nested into a theta wave. Gamma cycles are thought to represent single memory items; therefore, this interplay could determine individual memory capacity. We directly tested this hypothesis by means of parietal transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) set at slower (4 Hz) and faster (7 Hz) theta frequencies during a visuospatial WM paradigm. Accordingly, we found that 4-Hz tACS enhanced WM capacity, while 7-Hz tACS reduced WM capacity. Notably, these effects were found only for items presented to the hemifield contralateral to the stimulation site. This provides causal evidence for a frequency-dependent and spatially specific organization of WM storage, supporting the theta–gamma phase coupling theory of WM capacity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CD9CmLoVDB8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nina Wolinski, Nicholas R.

Tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, requires two phosphorylation steps to form a competitive inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. Adenylate kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;) has been previously demonstrated to phosphorylate tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate, while creatine kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;), pyruvate kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;) and pyruvate kinase, liver and red blood cell (&lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt;) each have been found to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to the pharmacologically active tenofovir-diphosphate. In the present study, genomic DNA isolated from dried blood spots collected from 505 participants from Bangkok, Thailand; Cape Town, South Africa; and New York City, USA were examined for variants in &lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt; using next-generation sequencing. The bioinformatics tools SIFT and PolyPhen predicted that 19 of the 505 individuals (3.7% frequency) carried variants in at least one kinase that would result in a decrease or loss of enzymatic activity. To functionally test these predictions, AK2 and AK2 variants were expressed in and purified from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, followed by investigation of their activities towards tenofovir. Interestingly, we found that purified AK2 had the ability to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to tenofovir-diphosphate in addition to phosphorylating tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate. Further, four of the six AK2 variants predicted to result in a loss or decrease of enzyme function exhibited a ≥30% decrease in activity towards tenofovir in our in vitro assays. Of note, an AK2 K28R variant resulted in a 72% and 81% decrease in the formation of tenofovir-monophosphate and tenofovir-diphosphate, respectively. These data suggest that there are naturally occurring genetic variants that could potentially impact TFV activation.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dominique B.

The fornicata (fornicates) is a eukaryotic group known to consist of free-living and parasitic organisms. Genome datasets of two model fornicate parasites &lt;i&gt;Giardia intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Spironucleus salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are well annotated, so far. The nuclear genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; assemblages and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are small in terms of the genome size and simple in genome structure. However, an ancestral genomic structure and gene contents, from which genomes of the fornicate parasites have evolved, remains to be clarified. In order to understand genome evolution in fornicates, here, we present the draft genome sequence of a free-living fornicate, &lt;i&gt;Kipferlia bialata&lt;/i&gt;, the divergence of which is earlier than those of the fornicate parasites, and compare it to the genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt;. Our data show that the number of protein genes and introns in &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; genome are the most abundant in the genomes of three fornicates, reflecting an ancestral state of fornicate genome evolution. Evasion mechanisms of host immunity found in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are absent in the &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; genome, suggesting that the two parasites acquired the complex membrane surface proteins on the line leading to the common ancestor of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; after the divergence from &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the mitochondrion related organelles (MROs) of &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; possess more complex suites of metabolic pathways than those in &lt;i&gt;Giardia&lt;/i&gt; and in &lt;i&gt;Spironucleus&lt;/i&gt;. In sum, our results unveil the process of reductive evolution which shaped the current genomes in two model fornicate parasites &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt;.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Goro Tanifuji, Shun Takabayashi, Keitaro Kume, Mizue Takagi, Takuro Nakayama, Ryoma Kamikawa, Yuji Inagaki, Tetsuo Hashimoto&lt;/p&gt;

In order to understand genome evolution in fornicates, here, we present the draft genome sequence of a free-living fornicate, &lt;i&gt;Kipferlia bialata&lt;/i&gt;, the divergence of which is earlier than those of the fornicate parasites, and compare it to the genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt;. Our data show that the number of protein genes and introns in &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; genome are the most abundant in the genomes of three fornicates, reflecting an ancestral state of fornicate genome evolution. Evasion mechanisms of host immunity found in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are absent in the &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; genome, suggesting that the two parasites acquired the complex membrane surface proteins on the line leading to the common ancestor of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; after the divergence from &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the mitochondrion related organelles (MROs) of &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; possess more complex suites of metabolic pathways than those in &lt;i&gt;Giardia&lt;/i&gt; and in &lt;i&gt;Spironucleus&lt;/i&gt;. In sum, our results unveil the process of reductive evolution which shaped the current genomes in two model fornicate parasites &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content></item><item><published>1522134000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03793-2/d41586-018-03793-2_15559644.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><width>1024</width></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Einstein, Bohr and the war over quantum theory</title><engagement>225</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2</originId><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16266f2b14f:605c2a3:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>5a608048</fingerprint><author><name>Ramin Skibba</name></author><crawled>1522145603919</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Einstein, Bohr and the war over quantum theory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einstein, Bohr and the war over quantum theory, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03793-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ramin Skibba explores a history of unresolved questions beyond the Copenhagen interpretation.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Einstein, Bohr and the war over quantum theory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einstein, Bohr and the war over quantum theory, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03793-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ramin Skibba explores a history of unresolved questions beyond the Copenhagen interpretation.</content></content></item><item><published>1522988922000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Time-resolved stimulated emission depletion and energy transfer dynamics in two-photon excited EGFP</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011643?af=R</originId><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b69:7c9981b6</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011643?af=R</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>4dfa3fa4</fingerprint><author><name>T.

Recent data suggest the existence of a complement alternative pathway activation in the pathogenesis of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a condition that remains poorly understood. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients with regard to their plasma complement levels at diagnosis. A retrospective monocentric study carried out at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of proteinase-3- or myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA and MPA patients from January 2000 to June 2016 and from September 2011 to June 2016, respectively. All patients with available C3 and C4 levels at diagnosis were included. Patients were categorized in the hypocomplementemia group if their C3 and/or C4 levels at diagnosis were below the lower limit of the normal range. Among the 76 AAV patients (43 GPA, 33 MPA), 4 (5%) had hypocomplementemia, and the 72 remaining patients exhibited normal plasma complement levels. All 4 hypocomplementemia patients had renal involvement. Hypocomplementemia was followed in 1 patient whose post-treatment complement level normalized within 1 month. Among all clinical and ANCA specificity, including relapse-free survival (p = 0.093), only overall and renal survival rates were significantly lower in the hypocomplementemia group (p = 0.0011 and p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). Hypocomplementemia with low C3 and/or C4 levels at GPA or MPA diagnosis may be responsible for worse survival and renal prognosis. These results argue for larger and prospective studies to better determine the epidemiology of the disease and to assess complement-targeting therapy in these patients.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Deshayes, Achille Aouba, Kathy Khoy, Delphine Mariotte, Thierry Lobbedez, Nicolas Martin Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Background and objectives &lt;p&gt;The clinical implications of the discordance between the risk of exacerbations and the level of airflow limitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are still unknown.

The data, collected by the Taiwan Obstructive Lung Disease consortium, were managed and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the enrolled participants, 316 (41.7%) had an inconsistency between the risk of exacerbations and the severity of airflow limitation. Univariate analysis showed that more severe airflow limitation (p = 0.000), higher COPD assessment test (CAT) scores (p = 0.003) and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scales (p = 0.008), and the presence of at least one (p = 0.000) or two (p = 0.003) co-morbidities were significantly associated with such inconsistency. More severe airflow limitation (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 3 and 4 classification; odds ratio (OR) = 27.09, p = 0.000 and OR = 25.15, p = 0.000, respectively) and the presence of at least one co-morbidity (OR = 2.01, p = 0.001) were still associated with the inconsistency in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the presence of wheezing (OR = 3.90, p = 0.000) and at least two co-morbidities (OR = 5.43, p = 0.005) were independent risk factors for an inconsistency of a high risk of exacerbations / GOLD 1 or 2 and the CAT score≧10 (OR = 1.58, p = 0.007), mMRC scale 2–4 (OR = 1.53, p = 0.017), and the presence of at least one co-morbidity (OR = 2.55, p = 0.000) for an inconsistency of a low risk of exacerbations / GOLD 3 or 4.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The patients with COPD and an inconsistency between the risk of exacerbations and level of airflow limitation had unique clinical characteristics and risk factors for this inconsistency.

Management of these patients should include more detailed evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1520827200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00547/20180312/images/medium/jp-2018-00547m_0006.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>274</height><width>500</width></visual><unread>False</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00547/20180312/images/medium/jp-2018-00547m_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00547&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Anti-predator signaling is highly variable with numerous examples of species employing cryptic coloration to avoid detection or conspicuous coloration (often coupled with a secondary defense) to ensure detection and recollection. While the ends of this spectrum are clear in their function, how species use intermediate signals is less clear. Australian Brood Frogs (&lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt;) display conspicuous coloration on both their dorsum and venter. Coupled with the alkaloid toxins these frogs possess, this coloration may be aposematic, providing a protective warning signal to predators. We assessed predation rates of known and novel color patterns and found no difference for avian or mammalian predators. However, when &lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt; dorsal phenotypes were collectively compared to the high-contrast ventral phenotype of this genus, we found birds, but not mammals, attacked dorsal phenotypes significantly less frequently than the ventral phenotype. This study, importantly, shows a differential predator response to ventral coloration in this genus which has implications for the evolution of conspicuous signaling in &lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt;.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Vandetanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of various cancers, has been reported to induce several adverse cardiac effects. However, the underlying mechanisms of vandetanib-induced cardiotoxicity are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of vandetanib-induced cardiotoxicity using intracellular electrophysiological recordings on human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), rabbit Purkinje fibers, and HEK293 cells transiently expressing human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG; the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Kr&lt;/sub&gt;), KCNQ1/KCNE1 (the slowly activating delayed rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt;), KCNJ2 (the inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt;) or SCN5A (the inward Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;). Purkinje fiber assays and ion channel studies showed that vandetanib at concentrations of 1 and 3 μM inhibited the hERG currents and prolonged the action potential duration. Alanine scanning and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; hERG docking studies demonstrated that Y652 and F656 in the hERG S6 domain play critical roles in vandetanib binding. In hiPSC-CMs, vandetanib markedly reduced the maximum rate of depolarization during the AP upstroke. Ion channel studies revealed that hiPSC-CMs were more sensitive to inhibition of the &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; by vandetanib than in a heterogeneously expressed HEK293 cell model, consistent with the changes in the AP parameters of hiPSC-CMs. The subclasses of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs inhibited &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; currents in a dose-dependent manner in hiPSC-CMs and SCN5A-encoded HEK293 cells. The inhibitory potency of vandetanib for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; was much higher in hiPSC-CMs (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 2.72 μM) than in HEK293 cells (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 36.63 μM). These data suggest that AP and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; assays using hiPSC-CMs are useful electrophysiological models for prediction of drug-induced cardiotoxicity.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyang-Ae Lee, Sung-Ae Hyun, Byungjin Byun, Jong-Hak Chae, Ki-Suk Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase (EIF2AK) proteins inhibit protein synthesis at translation initiation level, in response to various stress conditions, including oxidative stress, heme deficiency, osmotic shock, and heat shock. Origin and functional diversification of EIF2AK sequences remain ambiguous. Here we determine the origin and molecular evolution of EIF2AK proteins in lower eukaryotes and studied the molecular basis of divergence among sub-family sequences. Present work emphasized primitive origin of EIF2AK4 sub-family gene in lower eukaryotes of protozoan lineage. Phylogenetic analysis supported common origin and sub-family based classification of EIF2AKs. Functional divergence studies across sub-families revealed several putative amino acid sites, which assist in altered protein interactions of kinase domains. The data can facilitate designing site-directed experimental studies aiming at elucidating diverse functional aspects of kinase domains regarding down-regulation of protein synthesis.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by K.

Understanding how neurons cooperate to integrate sensory inputs and guide behavior is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. A large body of methods have been developed to study neuronal firing at the single cell and population levels, generally seeking interpretability as well as predictivity. However, these methods are usually confronted with the lack of ground-truth necessary to validate the approach. Here, using neuronal data from the head-direction (HD) system, we present evidence demonstrating how gradient boosted trees, a non-linear and supervised Machine Learning tool, can learn the relationship between behavioral parameters and neuronal responses with high accuracy by optimizing the information rate. Interestingly, and unlike other classes of Machine Learning methods, the intrinsic structure of the trees can be interpreted in relation to behavior (e.g. to recover the tuning curves) or to study how neurons cooperate with their peers in the network. We show how the method, unlike linear analysis, reveals that the coordination in thalamo-cortical circuits is qualitatively the same during wakefulness and sleep, indicating a brain-state independent feed-forward circuit. Machine Learning tools thus open new avenues for benchmarking model-based characterization of spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eLys5LrtLXM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Viejo, Thomas Cortier, Adrien Peyrache&lt;/p&gt;

Whipple&apos;s disease (WD) strikes only a small minority of individuals infected with Tw (&amp;lt;0.01%), whereas asymptomatic chronic carriage is more common (&amp;lt;25%). We studied a multiplex kindred, containing four WD patients and five healthy Tw chronic carriers. We hypothesized that WD displays autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance, with age-dependent incomplete penetrance. We identified a single very rare non-synonymous mutation in the four patients: the private R98W variant of IRF4, a transcription factor involved in immunity.

Whipple&apos;s disease (WD) strikes only a small minority of individuals infected with Tw (&amp;lt;0.01%), whereas asymptomatic chronic carriage is more common (&amp;lt;25%). We studied a multiplex kindred, containing four WD patients and five healthy Tw chronic carriers. We hypothesized that WD displays autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance, with age-dependent incomplete penetrance. We identified a single very rare non-synonymous mutation in the four patients: the private R98W variant of IRF4, a transcription factor involved in immunity. The five Tw carriers were younger, and also heterozygous for R98W. We found that R98W was loss-of-function, modified the transcriptome of heterozygous leukocytes following Tw stimulation, and was not dominant-negative. We also found that only six of the other 153 known non-synonymous IRF4 variants were loss-of-function. Finally, we found that &lt;i&gt;IRF4&lt;/i&gt; had evolved under purifying selection.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Although not currently recommended, spirometry during hospitalization due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an opportunity to enhance the diagnosis of this disease.

Forty-nine patients could not complete the study because they did not reach clinical stability. In three patients with obstructive spirometry during admission, the results were normal at follow-up.

As predominant components of hemicelluloses in grasses, methylglucuroarabinoxylans (MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are sources for the production of acidic xylooligosaccharides (U-XOS). &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; MR44, an engineered biocatalyst to secrete only the XynC xylanase and Axh43 arabinoxylan hydrolase is capable of processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to exclusively U-XOS. The present studies are directed at the explosion on direct alkaline extraction serving for production of U-XOS. Response Surface Methodology was used to optimize xylan extraction conditions on the sweet sorghum bagasse to achieve maximum hemicelluloses yield. The optimized condition was as follows: extraction time of 3.91 h, extraction temperature of 86.1°C, and NaOH concentration (w/w) of 12.33%. Crude xylan extracted with NaOH revealed a compositional analysis of xylose (79.0%), arabinose (5.3%), glucose (1.7%), lignin and ash (5.6%). After neutralization this xylan preparation supported growth of MR44, processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; from sweet sorghum and accumulating U-XOS. The quality of U-XOS produced by MR44 using alkaline-treated sweet sorghum bagasse was comparable to that obtained from purified MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Overall, the present study demonstrates that direct alkaline treatment of sweet sorghum bagasse is useful to improve the bioavailability of MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for MR44-mediated conversion to U-XOS with average degrees of polymerization of 11–12, providing alternative resources with applications in nutrition and human and veterinary medicine.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lusha Wei, Tongjing Yan, Yifei Wu, Hui Chen, Baoshan Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Within the human host, the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; is exposed to multiple selection pressures. The host environment changes dramatically in severe malaria, but the extent to which the parasite responds to—or is selected by—this environment remains unclear. From previous studies, the parasites that cause severe malaria appear to increase expression of a restricted but poorly defined subset of the PfEMP1 variant, surface antigens. PfEMP1s are major targets of protective immunity. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyse gene expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients. The transcriptomes of 19 parasite isolates associated with severe malaria indicated that these parasites had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and probably transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation; reduced surface expression of PfEMP1; and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins. Our RNAseq also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments and also confirmed all previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and severe disease. These findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and also indicate how parasites adapt to—or are selected by—the host environment in severe malaria.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rNZ95HC-F9Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gerry Q.

Sepsis is characterized by an intense systemic inflammatory response activating a cascade of proinflammatory events resulting in leukocyte dysregulation and host tissue damage. The lung is particularly susceptible to systemic inflammation, leading to acute lung injury. Key to inflammation-induced lung damage is the excessive migration of neutrophils across the vascular endothelium. The mechanisms which regulate neutrophil activation and migration in sepsis are not well defined but there is growing evidence that platelets are actively involved and play a key role in microvascular permeability and neutrophil-mediated organ damage. We previously identified PKC-delta (PKCδ) as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response in sepsis and demonstrated PKCδ inhibition was lung protective. However, the role of PKCδ in sepsis-induced platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interactions is not known. In this study, rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Following surgeries, a PKCδ inhibitor (200μg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was administered intra-tracheally. At 24 hours post-surgeries, lung tissue, BAL fluid, and blood samples were collected. While sepsis caused thrombocytopenia, the remaining circulating platelets were activated as demonstrated by increased p-selectin expression, elevated plasma PF4, and enhanced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation compared to Sham animals. Platelet activation was associated with increased platelet PKCδ activity. Inhibition of PKCδ attenuated sepsis-induced platelet activation, secretion and aggregate formation. Sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia was also significantly reduced and circulating platelet numbers were similar to sham animals. In the lung, sepsis induced significant influx of platelets and neutrophils and the development of lung injury. Administration of the PKCδ inhibitor decreased platelet and neutrophil influx, and was lung protective. Thus, PKCδ inhibition modulated platelet activity both locally and systemically, decreased neutrophil influx into the lung, and was lung protective. We demonstrate for the first time that PKCδ plays an important role in platelet activation and platelet-neutrophil interaction during sepsis.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elisabetta Liverani, Mark J.

Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</content></content></item><item><published>1522738800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-018-0018-1/MediaObjects/41586_2018_18_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>513</height><width>685</width></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Metabolic enzyme PFKFB4 activates transcriptional coactivator SRC-3 to drive breast cancer</title><engagement>144</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0018-1</originId><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1628d091f62:95ea4d7:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0018-1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ec830b94</fingerprint><author><name>Subhamoy Dasgupta</name></author><crawled>1522784608098</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0018-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metabolic enzyme PFKFB4 activates transcriptional coactivator SRC-3 to drive breast cancer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic enzyme PFKFB4 activates transcriptional coactivator SRC-3 to drive breast cancer, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0018-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0018-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The glycolytic enzyme PFKFB4 directly phosphorylates and regulates binding of the coactivator SRC-3 to ATF4 and thereby increases the transcriptional activity of this complex, leading to increased expression of metabolic genes, and enhancing tumour growth and metastasis.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metabolic enzyme PFKFB4 activates transcriptional coactivator SRC-3 to drive breast cancer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic enzyme PFKFB4 activates transcriptional coactivator SRC-3 to drive breast cancer, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0018-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0018-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The glycolytic enzyme PFKFB4 directly phosphorylates and regulates binding of the coactivator SRC-3 to ATF4 and thereby increases the transcriptional activity of this complex, leading to increased expression of metabolic genes, and enhancing tumour growth and metastasis.</content></content></item><item><published>1521183600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><unread>False</unread><title>Intersubband plasmons in the quantum limit in gated and aligned carbon nanotubes</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03381-y</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1622e4823fc:118ca87:7d6c1c1c</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03381-y</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/UqJh1wmnEMU/s41467-018-03381-y</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ce14982e</fingerprint><author><name>Kazuhiro Yanagi</name></author><crawled>1521194902524</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03381-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intersubband plasmons in the quantum limit in gated and aligned carbon nanotubes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intersubband plasmons in the quantum limit in gated and aligned carbon nanotubes, Published online: 16 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03381-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03381-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Quantum confinement has enabled the development of modern optoelectronic devices, including the quantum cascade laser, based on the control of intersubband plasmons.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to construct a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for measuring self-care performance (the CAT-SC) in children with developmental disabilities (DD) aged from 6 months to 12 years in a content-inclusive, precise, and efficient fashion.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was divided into 3 phases: (1) item bank development, (2) item testing, and (3) a simulation study to determine the stopping rules for the administration of the CAT-SC. A total of 215 caregivers of children with DD were interviewed with the 73-item CAT-SC item bank. An item response theory model was adopted for examining the construct validity to estimate item parameters after investigation of the unidimensionality, equality of slope parameters, item fitness, and differential item functioning (DIF). In the last phase, the reliability and concurrent validity of the CAT-SC were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The final CAT-SC item bank contained 56 items. The stopping rules suggested were (a) reliability coefficient greater than 0.9 or (b) 14 items administered. The results of simulation also showed that 85% of the estimated self-care performance scores would reach a reliability higher than 0.9 with a mean test length of 8.5 items, and the mean reliability for the rest was 0.86. Administering the CAT-SC could reduce the number of items administered by 75% to 84%. In addition, self-care performances estimated by the CAT-SC and the full item bank were very similar to each other (Pearson &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.98).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The newly developed CAT-SC can efficiently measure self-care performance in children with DD whose performances are comparable to those of TD children aged from 6 months to 12 years as precisely as the whole item bank. The item bank of the CAT-SC has good reliability and a unidimensional self-care construct, and the CAT can estimate self-care performance with less than 25% of the items in the item bank. Therefore, the CAT-SC could be useful for measuring self-care performance in children with DD in clinical and research settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cheng-Te Chen, Yu-Lan Chen, Yu-Ching Lin, Ching-Lin Hsieh, Jeng-Yi Tzeng, Kuan-Lin Chen&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, self-care performances estimated by the CAT-SC and the full item bank were very similar to each other (Pearson &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.98).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The newly developed CAT-SC can efficiently measure self-care performance in children with DD whose performances are comparable to those of TD children aged from 6 months to 12 years as precisely as the whole item bank. The item bank of the CAT-SC has good reliability and a unidimensional self-care construct, and the CAT can estimate self-care performance with less than 25% of the items in the item bank. Therefore, the CAT-SC could be useful for measuring self-care performance in children with DD in clinical and research settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1523307600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195607</canonicalUrl><updated>1523307600000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195607</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529c:9aea0a7d</id><title>Long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and mental health status: A nationwide population-based cross-sectional study</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195607</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ee5a65b4</fingerprint><author><name>Jinyoung Shin</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195607</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinyoung Shin, Jin Young Park, Jaekyung Choi&lt;/p&gt;
There is a suspected but unproven association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mental health. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and subjective stress, depressive disorders, health-related quality of life (QoL) and suicide. We selected 124,205 adults from the Korean Community Health Survey in 2013 who were at least 19 years old and who had lived in their current domiciles for &gt; five years. Based on the computer-assisted personal interviews to measure subjective stress in daily life, EuroQoL-5 dimensions, depression diagnosis by a doctor, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts, we evaluated the risk of mental disorders using multiple logistic regression analysis according to the quartiles of air pollutants, such as particulate matter &amp;lt;10μm (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide, using yearly average concentration between August 2012 and July 2013. The prevalence of high stress, poor QoL, depressiveness, diagnosis of depression, and suicide ideation was positively associated with high concentrations of PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO after adjusting for confounding factors. Men were at increased risk of stress, poor QoL, and depressiveness from air pollution exposure than were women. The risk of higher stress or poor QoL in subjects &amp;lt; age 65 increased with air pollution more than did that in subjects ≥ age 65. Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution may be an independent risk factor for mental health disorders ranging from subjective stress to suicide ideation.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinyoung Shin, Jin Young Park, Jaekyung Choi&lt;/p&gt;

Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis (SDS) is a protein separation technique widely used, for example, prior to immunoblotting. Samples are usually prepared in a buffer containing both high concentrations of reducers and high concentrations of SDS. This conjunction renders the samples incompatible with common protein assays. By chelating the SDS, cyclodextrins make the use of simple, dye-based colorimetric assays possible. In this paper, we describe the optimization of the assay, focussing on the cyclodextrin/SDS ratio and the use of commercial assay reagents. The adaptation of the assay to a microplate format and using other detergent-containing conventional extraction buffers is also described.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thierry Rabilloud&lt;/p&gt;

Transcriptomic analysis revealed that quiescent and activated NSCs exhibited differences in their protein homeostasis network. Whereas activated NSCs had active proteasomes, quiescent NSCs contained large lysosomes. Quiescent NSCs from young mice accumulated protein aggregates, and many of these aggregates were stored in large lysosomes.

Transcriptomic analysis revealed that quiescent and activated NSCs exhibited differences in their protein homeostasis network. Whereas activated NSCs had active proteasomes, quiescent NSCs contained large lysosomes. Quiescent NSCs from young mice accumulated protein aggregates, and many of these aggregates were stored in large lysosomes. Perturbation of lysosomal activity in quiescent NSCs affected protein-aggregate accumulation and the ability of quiescent NSCs to activate. During aging, quiescent NSCs displayed defects in their lysosomes, increased accumulation of protein aggregates, and reduced ability to activate.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved therapy for treatment of epilepsy and depression. While also shown to be promising in several preclinical and clinical studies to treat cardiovascular diseases, optimal therapeutic stimulation paradigms are still under investigation. Traditionally, parameters such as frequency, current, and duty cycle are used to adjust the efficacy of VNS therapy. This study explored the effect of novel stochastic VNS (S-VNS) on acute heart rate (HR) dynamics. The effect of S-VNS was evaluated in Sprague Dawley rats by comparing the acute HR and HR variability (HRV) responses to standard, periodic VNS (P-VNS) across different frequencies (FREQs, 10–30 Hz). Our results demonstrate that both S-VNS and P-VNS produced negative chronotropic effects in a FREQ-dependent manner with S-VNS inducing a significantly smaller drop in HR at 10 Hz and 20 Hz compared to P-VNS (p&amp;lt;0.05). S-VNS demonstrated a FREQ-dependent drop in the SD1/SD2 ratio, a measure of HRV, which was absent in P-VNS, suggesting that S-VNS may acutely modulate the nonlinear relationship between short- and long-term HRV. In conclusion, S-VNS is a novel stimulation procedure that may provide different physiological outcomes from standard P-VNS, as indicated by our analysis of HR dynamics. Our study provides a rationale for further detailed investigations into the therapeutic potential of S-VNS as a novel neuromodulation technique.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Steven W.

When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6W0_cn-RZQs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shiva Farashahi, Chih-Chung Ting, Chang-Hao Kao, Shih-Wei Wu, Alireza Soltani&lt;/p&gt;

The general question by what mechanism an “effector” molecule and the hemes of hemoglobin interact over widely separated intramolecular distances to change the oxygen affinity has been extensively investigated, and still has remained of central interest. In the present work we were interested in clarifying the general role of the protein matrix and its dynamics in the regulation of human adult hemoglobin (HbA). We used a spectroscopy approach that yields the compressibility (&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;) of the protein matrix around the hemes of the subunits in HbA and studied how the binding of heterotropic allosteric effectors modify this parameter. &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; is directly related to the variance of volume fluctuation, therefore it characterizes the molecular dynamics of the protein structure. For the experiments the heme groups either in the α or in the β subunits of HbA were replaced by fluorescent Zn-protoporphyrinIX, and series of fluorescence line narrowed spectra were measured at varied pressures. The evaluation of the spectra yielded the compressibility that showed significant dynamic asymmetry between the subunits: &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunit was 0.17±0.05/GPa, while for the β subunit it was much higher, 0.36±0.07/GPa. The heterotropic effectors, chloride ions, inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate did not cause significant changes in &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunits, while in the β subunits the effectors lead to a significant reduction down to 0.15±0.04/GPa. We relate our results to structural data, to results of recent functional studies and to those of molecular dynamics simulations, and find good agreements. The observed asymmetry in the flexibility suggests a distinct role of the subunits in the regulation of Hb that results in the observed changes of the oxygen binding capability.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gusztáv Schay, András D.

The goal of this study was to evaluate survival of important viral pathogens of livestock in animal feed ingredients imported daily into the United States under simulated transboundary conditions. Eleven viruses were selected based on global significance and impact to the livestock industry, including Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV), Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV), Influenza A Virus of Swine (IAV-S), Pseudorabies virus (PRV), Nipah Virus (NiV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), Swine Vesicular Disease Virus (SVDV), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) and Vesicular Exanthema of Swine Virus (VESV). Surrogate viruses with similar genetic and physical properties were used for 6 viruses. Surrogates belonged to the same virus families as target pathogens, and included Senecavirus A (SVA) for FMDV, Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) for CSFV, Bovine Herpesvirus Type 1 (BHV-1) for PRV, Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) for NiV, Porcine Sapelovirus (PSV) for SVDV and Feline Calicivirus (FCV) for VESV. For the remaining target viruses, actual pathogens were used. Virus survival was evaluated using Trans-Pacific or Trans-Atlantic transboundary models involving representative feed ingredients, transport times and environmental conditions, with samples tested by PCR, VI and/or swine bioassay. SVA (representing FMDV), FCV (representing VESV), BHV-1 (representing PRV), PRRSV, PSV (representing SVDV), ASFV and PCV2 maintained infectivity during transport, while BVDV (representing CSFV), VSV, CDV (representing NiV) and IAV-S did not. Notably, more viruses survived in conventional soybean meal, lysine hydrochloride, choline chloride, vitamin D and pork sausage casings. These results support published data on transboundary risk of PEDV in feed, demonstrate survival of certain viruses in specific feed ingredients (“high-risk combinations”) under conditions simulating transport between continents and provide further evidence that contaminated feed ingredients may represent a risk for transport of pathogens at domestic and global levels.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Scott A.

Background &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the risk of osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) using a nationwide population-based dataset.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In a cohort study of 986,713 individuals, we selected 2,493 PBC patients who were aged 18 years or older and had been diagnosed with PBC, based on the International Classification of Disease (ICD-9-CM) codes 571.6, during 20002010. The control cohort comprised 9,972 randomly selected, propensity matched patients (by age, gender, and index date), without PBC. Using this adjusted data, a possible association between PBC and the risk of developing osteoporosis was estimated using a Cox proportional hazard regression model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the follow-up period, osteoporosis was diagnosed in 150 (6.02%) patients in the PBC cohort and in 539 (5.41%) patients in the non-PBC cohort. After adjusting for covariates, osteoporosis risk was found to be 3.333 times greater in the PBC cohort than in the non-PBC cohort when measured over 6 years after PBC diagnosis. Stratification revealed that the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) had no significance in decreasing the risk of osteoporosis when comparing the PBC cohorts with the non-PBC cohorts (P = 0.124). Additionally, osteoporosis risk was significantly higher in PBC patients with steroid use (aHR: 6.899 vs 3.333). Moreover, when comparing the PBC cohorts to the non-PBC cohorts, the non-cirrhotic patients were prone to osteoporosis at a younger age compared to those in the cirrhotic cohorts. We also found that the associated risk of fractures is only prominent for vertebral and wrist fractures in the PBC cohort compared to that in the non-PBC cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A significant association exists between PBC and subsequent risk for osteoporosis.

Discovery of copy number variations (CNVs), a major category of structural variations, have dramatically changed our understanding of differences between individuals and provide an alternate paradigm for the genetic basis of human diseases. CNVs include both copy gain and copy loss events and their detection genome-wide is now possible using high-throughput, low-cost next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. However, accurate detection of CNVs from NGS data is not straightforward due to non-uniform coverage of reads resulting from various systemic biases. We have developed an integrated platform, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV, to handle some of these issues in CNV detection in whole genome NGS data.

Discovery of copy number variations (CNVs), a major category of structural variations, have dramatically changed our understanding of differences between individuals and provide an alternate paradigm for the genetic basis of human diseases. CNVs include both copy gain and copy loss events and their detection genome-wide is now possible using high-throughput, low-cost next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. However, accurate detection of CNVs from NGS data is not straightforward due to non-uniform coverage of reads resulting from various systemic biases. We have developed an integrated platform, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV, to handle some of these issues in CNV detection in whole genome NGS data. It has a modular framework comprising five major modules: data pre-treatment, segmentation, variant calling, annotation and visualization.

Our present frequently resembles our past. Patterns of actions and events repeat throughout our lives like a motif. Identifying and exploiting these patterns are fundamental to many behaviours, from creating grammar to the application of skill across diverse situations. Such generalization may be dependent upon memory instability. Following their formation, memories are unstable and able to interact with one another, allowing, at least in principle, common features to be extracted. Exploiting these common features creates generalized knowledge that can be applied across varied circumstances. Memory instability explains many of the biological and behavioural conditions necessary for generalization and offers predictions for how generalization is produced.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/lVg7LP0Sslg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Edwin M.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple marker of inflammation, has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation. However, whether it can be used to predict HCC development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative NLR for the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy. A total of 230 HBV-associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2012 were included in this study. Detailed clinical data included patients’ general characteristics, laboratory tests and imaging studies, surgical procedures and complications. Information on patients’ follow-up data was also obtained. We found that 38 (16.52%) patients developed HCC after splenectomy during the follow-up period. An elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of developing HCC in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for HCC development was 2.27. In patients who developed HCC during the follow-up period, NLR scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy. However, NLR scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop HCC. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqing Du, Jian Dong, Jianbin Bi, Ruhai Bai, Jia Zhang, Zheng Wu, Yi Lv, Xufeng Zhang, Rongqian Wu&lt;/p&gt;

The immunological profiles of human specific IgE (sIgE) and specific IgG4 (sIgG4) vary by genetic predisposition, living conditions in different geographical locations and patient’s age. The aim of our study was to analyze sIgE and sIgG4 patterns and their age-dependent changes in patients from the Moscow region. For identifying sIgE and sIgG4 profiles the blood samples from 513 patients aged 6 months to 17 years who were showing symptoms of allergic diseases were analyzed using microarrays containing 31 allergens. The highest sIgE prevalence was observed for birch pollen (32%) among pollen allergens, cat dander (24%) among indoor allergens, and egg whites (21%) among food allergens. The most common sIgG4 response was developed toward egg whites (80% of patients). Age-related elevation was identified for patients with increased sIgE to pollen allergens and indoor allergens (cat or dog dander and house dust mites). For each allergen, the proportion of cases with significant levels of sIgG4 appeared to increase with patients’ age. The data on allergen-specific sIgE and sIgG4 prevalence show both general trends and some local special aspects that are indicative for the Moscow region. This information should be useful in terms of epidemiology of allergic diseases.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sergei Voloshin, Olga Smoldovskaya, Guzel Feyzkhanova, Alla Arefieva, Lyudmila Pavlushkina, Tatiana Filatova, Veronika Butvilovskaya, Marina Filippova, Yuri Lysov, Sergey Shcherbo, Alexander Makarov, Alla Rubina, Alexander Zasedatelev&lt;/p&gt;

Skeletal muscle function is highly dependent on the ability to regenerate, however, during ageing or disease, the proliferative capacity is reduced, leading to loss of muscle function. We have previously demonstrated the presence of vitamin K2 in bovine skeletal muscles, but whether vitamin K has a role in muscle regulation and function is unknown. In this study, we used primary bovine skeletal muscle cells, cultured in monolayers &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, to assess a potential effect of vitamin K2 (MK-4) during myogenesis of muscle cells. Cell viability experiments demonstrate that the amount of ATP produced by the cells was unchanged when MK-4 was added, indicating viable cells. Cytotoxicity analysis show that MK-4 reduced the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the media, suggesting that MK-4 was beneficial to the muscle cells. Cell migration, proliferation and differentiation was characterised after MK-4 incubation using wound scratch analysis, immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR analysis. Adding MK-4 to the cells led to an increased muscle proliferation, increased gene expression of the myogenic transcription factor &lt;i&gt;myod&lt;/i&gt; as well as increased cell migration. In addition, we observed a reduction in the fusion index and relative gene expression of muscle differentiation markers, with fewer complex myotubes formed in MK-4 stimulated cells compared to control cells, indicating that the MK-4 plays a significant role during the early phases of muscle proliferation. Likewise, we see the same pattern for the relative gene expression of collagen 1A, showing increased gene expression in proliferating cells, and reduced expression in differentiating cells. Our results also suggest that MK-4 incubation affect low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) with a peak in gene expression after 45 min of MK-4 incubation. Altogether, our experiments show that MK-4 has a positive effect on muscle cell migration and proliferation, which are two important steps during early myogenesis.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sissel Beate Rønning, Mona Elisabeth Pedersen, Ragnhild Stenberg Berg, Bente Kirkhus, Rune Rødbotten&lt;/p&gt;

British &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; complex [&lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato) mosquito distribution, abundance, and potential for disease transmission are intimately linked to their environment. Pond and lake dyes that block light to restrict algal photosynthesis are a relatively new product assumed to be an environmentally friendly since they are based on food dyes. Their use in urban garden ponds raises questions linked to mosquito oviposition, since coloured water can be an attractant. &lt;i&gt;Culex (&lt;/i&gt;mostly &lt;i&gt;pipiens)&lt;/i&gt; is commonly found in UK gardens and is a potential vector of viruses including the West Nile Virus (WNV). Any factors that significantly change the distribution and population of &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; could impact future risks of disease transmission. A gravid trap was used to catch female &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes for use in oviposition choice tests in laboratory and semi-field conditions. Two types of pond dye, blue and shadow (which looks slightly red), were tested for their impact on oviposition and survival of wild caught &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt;. There were no significant differences in the number of egg batches laid when gravid mosquitoes were given a choice between either blue dye and clear water or shadow dye and clear water indicating that these dyes are not attractants. Larvae hatched from egg batches laid by wild-caught gravid females were used to measure survival to adulthood with or without dye, in a habitat controlled to prevent further colonisation. The experiment was run twice, once in the summer and again in the autumn, whereas the dyes had no impact on emergence in the summer, there were highly significant reductions in emergence of adults in both dye treated habitats in the autumn. Containers with or without shadow dye were placed outside to colonise naturally and were sampled weekly for larvae and pupae over a 6 month period through summer and autumn. There was a significant negative effect of shadow dye on pupal abundance in a three week period over the summer, but otherwise there was no effect. It is likely that population abundance and food was a more powerful factor for mosquito survival than the dye.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Natali Ortiz-Perea, Rebecca Gander, Oliver Abbey, Amanda Callaghan&lt;/p&gt;

However, the functional variants underlying these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context. Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells. To this end, we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data. Overall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohn&apos;s disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (p_rs102275=1.44e-20, p_rs968567=2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs (all with p&amp;lt;0.05). In summary, our study points towards a pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmunity.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic risk loci for autoimmune diseases.

Background &lt;p&gt;In Kazakhstan, scarce official prevalence data exists for mood disorders. This study investigates the occurrence of depressive symptoms among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and the relationship between depressive symptoms, HIV treatment initiation and antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients seen at the Almaty AIDS Center between April and December 2013. Two data sources were used: 1) self-administered survey that included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to capture depression symptoms and 2) medical record review. Two primary outcomes were evaluated with log-binomial models and Fisher’s exact test: the relationship between depression symptoms and 1) HIV treatment group, and 2) HIV adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 564 participants, 9.9% reported symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder. None had received treatment for depression. Among those not on ART, a relationship between depressive symptoms and low CD4 counts (≤ 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) was evident (7.1% for CD4 ≤ 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 0.9% for CD4 &gt; 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, p = 0.029). In multivariable analysis, a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms was statistically associated with ART treatment, positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) status, and being unmarried. For those taking ART, treatment adherence was not statistically associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms (12.5% vs 20.0%, p = 0.176); limited power may have impacted statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Untreated depression was found among PLWHA suggesting the need to evaluate access to psychiatric treatment.

A collaborative strategy may be helpful to optimize HIV treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522209600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b12484/20180328/images/medium/jp-2017-12484j_0007.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>312</height><width>500</width></visual><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b12484/20180328/images/medium/jp-2017-12484j_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12484&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The cause of early metastatic relapse in breast cancer has long been debated, with many ascribing these relapses to the natural progression of the disease. Others have proposed that some aspect of surgical tumor resection triggers the outgrowth of otherwise-dormant metastases, leading to the synchronous pattern of relapse. Clinical data cannot distinguish between these hypotheses, and previous experimental approaches have not provided clear answers. Such uncertainty hinders the development and application of therapeutic approaches that could potentially reduce early metastatic relapse. We describe an experimental model system that definitively links surgery and the subsequent wound-healing response to the outgrowth of tumor cells at distant anatomical sites. Specifically, we find that the systemic inflammatory response induced after surgery promotes the emergence of tumors whose growth was otherwise restricted by a tumor-specific T cell response. Furthermore, we demonstrate that perioperative anti-inflammatory treatment markedly reduces tumor outgrowth in this model, suggesting that similar approaches might substantially reduce early metastatic recurrence in breast cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Patients undergoing surgical resection of primary breast tumors confront a risk for metastatic recurrence that peaks sharply 12 to 18 months after surgery.

Most Chinese lithic industries dated between 300,000 and 40,000 are characterized by the absence of Levallois debitage, the persistence of core-and-flake knapping, the rarity of prepared cores, their reduction with direct hard hammer percussion, and the rarity of retouched flakes. Here we report the discovery of seven bone soft hammers at the early hominin Lingjing site (Xuchang County, Henan) dated to 125,000–105,000. These artefacts represent the first instance of the use of bone as raw material to modify stone tools found at an East Asian early Late Pleistocene site. Three types of soft hammers are identified. The first consists of large bone flakes resulting from butchery of large herbivores that were utilized as such for expedient stone tools retouching or resharpening. The second involved the fracture of weathered bone from medium size herbivores to obtain elongated splinters shaped by percussion into sub-rectangular artefacts. Traces observed on these objects indicate intensive and possibly recurrent utilization, which implies their curation over time. The last consists of antler, occasionally used. Lingjing bone tools complement what we know about archaic hominin cultural adaptations in East Asia and highlight behavioural consistencies that could not be inferred from other cultural proxies. This discovery provides a new dimension to the debate surrounding the existence of the Middle Palaeolithic in the region. The attribution of East Asian sites to the Middle Palaeolithic assumes that cultural traits such as the Levallois method represent evolutionary hallmarks applicable to regions of the world different from those in which they were originally found. Here, we promote an approach that consists in identifying, possibly from different categories of material culture, the original features of each regional cultural trajectory and understanding the behavioural and cognitive implications they may have had for past hominin populations.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Luc Doyon, Zhanyang Li, Hao Li, Francesco d’Errico&lt;/p&gt;

The use of antimicrobial monomers, linked to the polymer chain of resin composites, is an interesting approach to circumvent the effects of bacteria on the dental and material surfaces. In addition, it can likely reduce the incidence of recurrent caries lesions.

The presence of Triclosan Methacrylate monomer causes harmful effects at molecular and cellular levels in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mutans&lt;/i&gt;, implying a reduction in the virulence of those microorganisms.</content></content></item><item><published>1522098000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><unread>True</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><engagement>31</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006056</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1626369d765:13d2b8:a077e55f</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006056</href></item></canonical><title>From correlation to causation: Estimating effective connectivity from zero-lag covariances of brain signals</title><recrawled>1522095842894</recrawled><fingerprint>cc3e5fdc</fingerprint><author><name>Jonathan Schiefer</name></author><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006056</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Schiefer, Alexander Niederbühl, Volker Pernice, Carolin Lennartz, Jürgen Hennig, Pierre LeVan, Stefan Rotter&lt;/p&gt;
Knowing brain connectivity is of great importance both in basic research and for clinical applications. We are proposing a method to infer directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances of neuronal activity recorded at multiple sites. This allows us to identify causal relations that are reflected in neuronal population activity. To derive our strategy, we assume a generic linear model of interacting continuous variables, the components of which represent the activity of local neuronal populations. The suggested method for inferring connectivity from recorded signals exploits the fact that the covariance matrix derived from the observed activity contains information about the existence, the direction and the sign of connections. Assuming a sparsely coupled network, we disambiguate the underlying causal structure via &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-minimization, which is known to prefer sparse solutions. In general, this method is suited to infer effective connectivity from resting state data of various types. We show that our method is applicable over a broad range of structural parameters regarding network size and connection probability of the network. We also explored parameters affecting its activity dynamics, like the eigenvalue spectrum. Also, based on the simulation of suitable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes to model BOLD dynamics, we show that with our method it is possible to estimate directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances derived from such signals. In this study, we consider measurement noise and unobserved nodes as additional confounding factors. Furthermore, we investigate the amount of data required for a reliable estimate. Additionally, we apply the proposed method on full-brain resting-state fast fMRI datasets. The resulting network exhibits a tendency for close-by areas being connected as well as inter-hemispheric connections between corresponding areas. In addition, we found that a surprisingly large fraction of more than one third of all identified connections were of inhibitory nature.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQUjBd7KMBU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Schiefer, Alexander Niederbühl, Volker Pernice, Carolin Lennartz, Jürgen Hennig, Pierre LeVan, Stefan Rotter&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Multiple drug resistant (MDR) intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are associated with notable direct and societal costs. As previous studies have not considered the impact of MDR on the total medical costs (TMCs) of IAIs, the present one examines this, as well as further estimates the additional costs at a national level.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective study. Firstly, we randomly selected a sample of 40% of all inpatients discharged between 2014 and 2015 from a teaching hospital, due to limits in budget and the large number of patients. Then, we manually selected 254 patients with IAIs according to the International Classification of Disease, 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; revision, using electronic medical records. Eventually, 101 patients with IAIs (64 MDR patients and 37 non-MDR patients) were included after excluding cases without laboratory test results, any pathogens detected, or antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Univariate analysis and a generalized linear model were applied to assess the parameters associated with TMCs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to non-MDR patients, those with MDR pathogens were significantly associated with higher TMCs, higher antimicrobial costs, higher antimicrobial usage, larger number of pathogens, and longer length of stay and were more likely to have insurance and combination antimicrobial therapy. In addition, the average TMC among patients with MDR pathogens was ¥ 131801, which is ¥ 90201 higher than those without MDR pathogens. If our results are applied to the whole country, the sum of all attributable TMCs was ¥ 37 billion. The societal costs, furthermore, were ¥111 billion in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results provide information that should lead to increased efforts to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, in order to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens and to reduce their economic burden.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xuemei Zhen, Yuanyuan Li, Yixi Chen, Peng Dong, Stephanie Liu, Hengjin Dong&lt;/p&gt;

These data are more valuable in aggregate: joint analysis of genomes from many sources increases sample size and statistical power for trait mapping, and will enable studies of genome biology, population genetics and genome function at unprecedented scale.

These data are more valuable in aggregate: joint analysis of genomes from many sources increases sample size and statistical power for trait mapping, and will enable studies of genome biology, population genetics and genome function at unprecedented scale.

Based on extensive Langevin Dynamics simulations we investigate the structural properties of a two-dimensional ensemble of magnetic rods with a peapod-like morphology, i.e, rods consisting of aligned single dipolar beads. Self-assembled configurations are studied for different directions of the dipole with respect to the rod axis. We found that with increasing misalignment of the dipole from the rod axis, the smaller the packing fraction at which the percolation transition is found. For the same density, the system exhibits different aggregation states for different misalignment.

Prediction of clinical staging is vital to implement optimal therapeutic strategy and prognostic prediction in cancer patients. However, to date, no method has been developed for predicting stage of LIHC from genomic profile of samples. Results: In current study, in silico models have been developed for classifying LIHC patients in early and late stage using RNA expression and DNA methylation data. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset contains 173 early and 177 late stage samples of LIHC, was extensively analysed to identify differentially expressed RNA transcripts and methylated CpG sites that can discriminate early and late stages of LIHC samples with high precision. Naive Bayes model developed using 51 features that combine 21 CpG methylation sites and 30 RNA transcripts achieved maximum MCC 0.58 with accuracy 78.87% on validation dataset. Further, we also analysed genomics and epigenomics profiles of normal and LIHC samples and developed model to classify LIHC samples with AUROC 0.99. In addition, multiclass models developed for classifying samples in normal, early and late stage of cancer and achieved accuracy of 76.54% and AUROC of 0.86. Conclusion: Our study reveals stage prediction of LIHC samples with high accuracy based on genomics and epigenomics profiling is a challenging task in comparison to classification of LIHC and normal samples.

Living animal cells are strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of their environment. To model physiological conditions ultrasoft cell culture substrates, in some instances with elasticity (Young&apos;s modulus) of only 1 kPa, are mandatory. Due to their long shelf life PDMS-based elastomers are a popular choice. However, uncertainty about additives in commercial formulations and difficulties to reach very soft materials limit their use. Here, we produced silicone elastomers from few, chemically defined and commercially available substances. Elastomers exhibited elasticities in the range from 1 kPa to 55 kPa. In detail, a high molecular weight (155 kg/mol), vinyl-terminated linear silicone was crosslinked with a multifunctional (f = 51) crosslinker (a copolymer of dimethyl siloxane and hydrosilane) by a platinum catalyst. The following different strategies towards ultrasoft materials were explored: sparse crosslinking, swelling with inert silicone polymers, and, finally, deliberate introduction of dangling ends into the network (inhibition). Rheological experiments with very low frequencies led to precise viscoelastic characterizations. All strategies enabled tuning of stiffness with the lowest stiffness of ~1 kPa reached by inhibition. This system was also most practical to use. Biocompatibility of materials was tested using primary cortical neurons from rats. Even after several days of cultivation no adverse effects were found.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Viktor Heinrichs, Sabine Dieluweit, Jörg Stellbrink, Wim Pyckhout-Hintzen, Nils Hersch, Dieter Richter, Rudolf Merkel&lt;/p&gt;

This system was also most practical to use. Biocompatibility of materials was tested using primary cortical neurons from rats. Even after several days of cultivation no adverse effects were found.</content></content></item><item><published>1521666000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194683</canonicalUrl><updated>1521666000000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194683</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087f1:7d6c1c1c</id><title>A nested mixture model for genomic prediction using whole-genome SNP genotypes</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194683</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>2b0a2650</fingerprint><author><name>Jian Zeng</name></author><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194683</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Zeng, Dorian Garrick, Jack Dekkers, Rohan Fernando&lt;/p&gt;
Genomic prediction exploits single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome for predicting genetic merit of selection candidates. In most models for genomic prediction, e.g. BayesA, B, C, R and GBLUP, independence of SNP effects is assumed. However, SNP effects are expected to be locally dependent given the presence of a nearby QTL because SNPs surrounding the QTL do not segregate independently. A consequence of ignoring this dependence is that SNPs with small effects may be overly shrunk, e.g. effects from markers with high minor allele frequencies (MAF) that flank QTL with low MAF. A nested mixture model (BayesN) is developed to account for the dependence of effects of SNPs that are closely linked, where the effects of SNPs in every non-overlapping genomic window &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; follow a point mass at zero for all SNPs or a mixture of some SNPs with nonzero effects and others with zero effects. It can be regarded as a parsimonious alternative to the existing antedependence model, antiBayesB, which allow a nonstationary dependence of SNP effects. Illumina 777K BovineHD genotypes from 948 Angus cattle were used to simulate 5,000 offspring, with 4,000 used for training and 1,000 for validation. Scenarios with 300 common (MAF &gt; 0.05) or rare (MAF &amp;lt; 0.05) QTL randomly selected from segregating SNPs were replicated 8 times. SNPs corresponding to QTL were masked from a 600k panel comprising SNPs with MAF &gt; 0.05 or a 50k evenly spaced subset of these. Compared with BayesB and a modified antiBayesB, BayesN improved the accuracy of prediction up to 2.0% with 50k SNPs and up to 7.0% with 600k SNPs, most improvements occurring in the rare QTL scenario. Computing time was reduced up to 60% with 50k SNPs and up to 75% with 600k SNPs. BayesN is an accurate and computationally efficient method for genomic prediction with whole-genome SNPs, especially for traits with rare QTL.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Zeng, Dorian Garrick, Jack Dekkers, Rohan Fernando&lt;/p&gt;

Well,</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Here are some sequels to stories I’ve written about here, things that have had some new chapters added to them. First off, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/17/approvals-and-otherwise-in-oncology&quot;&gt;this 2015 post&lt;/a&gt; mentions the steep drop in shares of Clovis Biotechnology, brought on by a rather sudden revision in the announced clinical performance of their lead drug (the covalent kinase inhibitor rociletinib). Well, it appears that the SEC found this to be rather abrupt as well, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/more-than-2-years-after-the-ugly-roci-debacle-clovis-says-that-the-sec-is-prepping-civil-charges/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endpts&lt;/em&gt; now reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company has been under investigation. Some of their investors have long claimed that the presentation of the clinical data had been manipulated in order to keep the company’s stock price up, and it looks like that theory is getting a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth remembering the different time scales involved. Think of the different parts of a cell: you get fast service from receptors and second-messenger systems (starting on a time scale of less than a second), but if you’re waiting for proteins to be synthesized, you need to come back in a few hours. Likewise the stock market reacts pretty quickly to bad news (Clovis got sold off on that news as if the shares were giving off radon gas), but the regulatory authorities are much slower. That said, they’re also pretty hard to dislodge once they get a fix on your position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the markets can take a while to react to things, too, because it’s differences of opinion that make them work in the first place. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/07/30/another_alzheimers_ipo&quot;&gt;Here’s another post&lt;/a&gt; from 2015 where I wrote about the IPO of a company (vTv Therapeutics, formerly TransTech) trying to make a go of it with a retread Alzheimer’s therapy. The comparison with Axovant was obvious at the time, and some readers will recall &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/09/27/bad-news-but-not-the-unexpected-kind&quot;&gt;what eventually happened to them&lt;/a&gt; when their own drug failed yet again in an Alzheimer’s trial. As that post mentioned, I was short Axovant stock when that took place (an event that financed the purchase of a new 18-inch Dobsonian telescope around here). Well, vTv &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xconomy.com/raleigh-durham/2018/04/09/with-alzheimers-failure-vtv-fares-no-better-than-old-partner-pfizer/&quot;&gt;announced their own clinical trial results&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, and to no one’s particular surprise, the compound failed for them, just as it had for Pfizer back in the day when TransTech had licensed it to them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s stock had been up over $7 earlier in the year, on what I thought was rather misplaced optimism. I sold them short in January at $7.42, and have been careful not to write about them in any way since doing so (in fact, I haven’t mentioned them at all since that 2015 post). VTVT &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/vtvt?p=vtvt&quot;&gt;had been dropping&lt;/a&gt; since then, and was back down in the $3 range before they announced this news, but that failed trial sent them down steeply. At that point I naturally covered my position, which is one reason I mention it now. The stock is trading this morning at about $0.67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know, if someone else comes along with a drug that’s already failed one or two Alzheimer’s trials, I’m very likely to short them, too. One of these days some odd AD mechanism is (I hope) going to work, but given the odds of clinical success, financing things like Axovant’s or vTv’s drugs that have &lt;em&gt;already failed in the clinic&lt;/em&gt; seems like a bad idea. And that’s the other reason I’m bringing up my short sales of these companies: I (and the other people who were also short these outfits) should actually not be handed such opportunities. Axovant and vTv should not, in a more rational market, have been able to go public as blithely as they did with the assets that they had, and their market caps should not have achieved what heights they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great time to finance small biopharma companies (and here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LifeSciVC/status/983763134090530816&quot;&gt;a series of Twitter posts&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Booth with some good advice on that subject). But with all this money sloshing around, some of it (as always under these conditions) is going into some rather stupid ideas. &lt;em&gt;Caveat investor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/11/bad-investments</href></item></alternate></item><item><published>1521529200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03346-7/d41586-018-03346-7_15545078.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><width>1024</width></visual><unread>False</unread><title>US kids’ doodles of scientists reveal changing gender stereotypes</title><engagement>2678</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03346-7</originId><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16241a886ae:2b6101c:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03346-7</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>8a5a1aad</fingerprint><author><name>Giorgia Guglielmi</name></author><crawled>1521519986350</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03346-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;US kids’ doodles of scientists reveal changing gender stereotypes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US kids’ doodles of scientists reveal changing gender stereotypes, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03346-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03346-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Experiments that ask children to draw a scientist show a greater proportion of women in sketches over time.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;US kids’ doodles of scientists reveal changing gender stereotypes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US kids’ doodles of scientists reveal changing gender stereotypes, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03346-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03346-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Experiments that ask children to draw a scientist show a greater proportion of women in sketches over time.</content></content></item><item><published>1522774666000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/14/3716/F1.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>406</height><width>440</width></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Gibberellin DELLA signaling targets the retromer complex to redirect protein trafficking to the plasma membrane [Plant Biology]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3716.short?rss=1</originId><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1628cac297a:9554b7c:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3716</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3716.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>340940f7</fingerprint><author><name>Yuliya Salanenka, Inge Verstraeten, Christian Lofke, Kaori Tabata, Satoshi Naramoto, Matouš Glanc, Jiři Friml</name></author><crawled>1522778515834</crawled><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3716.short?rss=1</link><description>The plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) is a crucial regulator of growth and development.

Despite evidence that the ability to taste is weakened by obesity and can be rescued with weight loss intervention, few studies have investigated the molecular effects of obesity on the taste system. Taste bud cells undergo continual turnover even in adulthood, exhibiting an average life span of only a few weeks, tightly controlled by a balance of proliferation and cell death. Recent data reveal that an acute inflammation event can alter this balance. We demonstrate that chronic low-grade inflammation brought on by obesity reduces the number of taste buds in gustatory tissues of mice—and is likely the cause of taste dysfunction seen in obese populations—by upsetting this balance of renewal and cell death.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OTfX7eySHIY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Kaufman, Ezen Choo, Anna Koh, Robin Dando&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; is an important cause of infection and commonly colonizes the nasopharynx of young children, along with other potentially pathogenic bacteria. The objectives of this study were to estimate the carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Moraxella catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; in young children in Indonesia, and to examine interactions between these bacterial species. 302 healthy children aged 12–24 months were enrolled in community health centers in the Bandung, Central Lombok, and Padang regions. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and stored according to World Health Organization recommendations, and bacterial species detected by qPCR. Pneumococcal serotyping was conducted by microarray and latex agglutination/Quellung. Overall carriage prevalence was 49.5% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, 27.5% for &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, 42.7% for &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and 7.3% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;.

Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a well-validated target for the therapy of adult cancers. Propane-1,3-diphosphonic acid (PDPA) has significant inhibitory properties against human thymidylate synthase (hTS) relative to mouse TS which is not predicted to adopt an inactive conformer. The current research aims to identify novel, lead inhibitors of hTS and examine the prediction that they bind selectively to hTS enzymes existing in different conformational equilibria. Conformer-selectivity was evaluated through performing activity inhibition studies, as well as intrinsic fluorescence (IF) studies in comparison to the known orthosteric inhibitor raltitrexed (RTX). Human TS was isolated from recombinant bacteria expressing either native hTS, capable of conformational switching, or an actively stabilized mutant (R163K-hTS). The examined test compounds were rationally or virtually predicted to have inhibitory activity against hTS. Among these compounds, glutarate, N-(4-carboxyphenyl) succinamic acid, and diglycolic anhydride showed higher selectivity towards native hTS as compared to R163K-hTS. The active site inhibitor RTX showed significantly higher inhibition of R163K-hTS relative to hTS. Targeting hTS via conformational selectivity represents a future approach for overcoming reported resistance towards active-state TS analogs.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hala O.

Performance-based financing (PBF) schemes have been expanding rapidly across low and middle income countries in the past decade, with considerable external financing from multilateral, bilateral and global health initiatives. Many of these countries have been fragile and conflict-affected (FCAS), but while the influence of context is acknowledged to be important to the operation of PBF, there has been little examination of how it affects adoption and implementation of PBF. This article lays out initial hypotheses about how FCAS contexts may influence the adoption, adaption, implementation and health system effects of PBF. These are then interrogated through a review of available grey and published literature (140 documents in total, covering 23 PBF schemes). We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Paola Bertone, Jean-Benoît Falisse, Giuliano Russo, Sophie Witter&lt;/p&gt;

We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</content></content></item><item><published>1523554635000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Dormancy by communication shutdown</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-d?rss=1</originId><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fece98:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/166.4.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-d?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>5294642e</fingerprint><author><name>Hines, P.

Background &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to conduct an indirect treatment comparison between cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel relative to comparators in the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who progress on docetaxel-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the network meta-analysis of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Due to a lack of head-to-head trials, studies with a comparator arm of best supportive care were included in the analysis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events were compared within both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks. The ratios for survival outcomes were estimated using hazard ratios (HR), and the ratios for adverse events between groups were estimated using odds ratios (ORs); uncertainty was reported as 95% confidence (Frequentist) and credible (Baysesian) Intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three of thirteen trials identified for abstraction were relevant for analyses. Median overall survival was not statistically significantly different for abiraterone (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.83–1.28) or enzalutamide (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.69–1.11) when compared to cabazitaxel in the Bayesian analysis. Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01–10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI = 1.41–75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03–10.09) were more likely to occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14–206.40). Frequentist analyses produced similar results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The scarcity of clinical studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles. As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the beneficial effects of these therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jon P.

In recent years, entrepreneurship has been gaining more prominence as a potential tool for solving poverty in developing countries. This paper mainly examines the relationship between farmer entrepreneurship and rural poverty alleviation in China by assessing the contribution of farm entrepreneurs towards overcoming poverty. Data were collected from 309 employees of farmer entrepreneurships in Guangxi Province through survey questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct an analysis of the effects of three identified capabilities of farm entrepreneurs—economic, educational and knowledge, and socio-cultural capabilities—on attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth and the qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship and how these in turn affect rural poverty, using AMOS 21. The findings show that socio-cultural capability has the greatest influence on farmer entrepreneurship growth (β = 0.50, p&amp;lt;0.001). The qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship also more significantly impacts rural poverty (β = 0.69, p&amp;lt;0.001) than attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth. This study suggests that policy makers in China should involve more rural farmers in the targeted poverty alleviation strategies of the government by equipping rural farmers with entrepreneurial skills. This can serve as a sustainable, bottom-up approach to alleviating rural poverty in remote areas of the country. The study also extends the literature on the farmer entrepreneurship-rural poverty alleviation nexus in China, and this can serve as a lesson for other developing countries in the fight against rural poverty.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Yaw Naminse, Jincai Zhuang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Polypharmacy is common among older adults. However, little is known about the composition of polypharmacy: which are the most frequently used drugs, and how much do these drugs contribute to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 822,619 Swedes aged ≥75 years was identified from the Total Population Register. Through record-linkage with the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and the Social Services Register we could analyze concurrent drug use in the entire population (both individuals living in the community and institution) on the 31 December 2013.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of polypharmacy (≥5 drugs) was 45%. The most frequently used drugs were cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, and psychotropics. By excluding the ten most frequently used drug classes or compounds, the prevalence of polypharmacy was reduced by 69% and 51% respectively. The majority of the users of either one of the 10 most frequently used drugs concurrently used at least 4 other drug classes (66%-85%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Almost half of the individuals aged ≥75 years are exposed to polypharmacy in Sweden. A handful of drugs make a large contribution to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy and the majority of drugs prescribed to persons aged ≥75 years are used in combination with other drugs. This highlights the high use of drugs, and the need to consider other concurrent drug treatments when prescribing for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonas W.

The flow field past a prosthetic aortic valve comprises many details that indicate whether the prosthesis is functioning well or not. It is, however, not yet fully understood how an optimal flow scenario would look, i.e. which subtleties of the fluid dynamics in place are essential regarding the durability and compatibility of a prosthetic valve. In this study, we measured and analyzed the 3D flow field in the vicinity of a bio-prosthetic heart valve in function of the aortic root size. The measurements were conducted within aortic root phantoms of different size, mounted in a custom-built hydraulic setup, which mimicked physiological flow conditions in the aorta. Tomographic particle image velocimetry was used to measure the 3D instantaneous velocity field at various instances. Several 3D fields (e.g. instantaneous and mean velocity, 3D shear rate) were analyzed and compared focusing on the impact of the aortic root size, but also in order to gain general insight in the 3D flow structure past the bio-prosthetic valve. We found that the diameter of the aortic jet relative to the diameter of the ascending aorta is the most important parameter in determining the characteristics of the flow. A large aortic cross-section, relative to the cross-section of the aortic jet, was associated with higher levels of turbulence intensity and higher retrograde flow in the ascending aorta.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by David Hasler, Dominik Obrist&lt;/p&gt;

More than 90% of the cases of Parkinson’s disease have unknown etiology. Gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra is the main cause of morbidity in this disease. External factors such as environmental toxins are believed to play a role in the cell loss, although the cause of the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons remains unknown. We have previously shown that aquaglyceroporin AQP9 is expressed in dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes of rodent brain. AQP9 is permeable to a broad spectrum of substrates including purines, pyrimidines, and lactate, in addition to water and glycerol. Here we test our hypothesis that AQP9 serves as an influx route for exogenous toxins and, hence, may contribute to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive) neurons. Using &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes injected with &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; cRNA, we show that AQP9 is permeable to the parkinsonogenic toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Stable expression of AQP9 in HEK cells increases their vulnerability to MPP+ and to arsenite—another parkinsonogenic toxin. Conversely, targeted deletion of &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; in mice protects nigral dopaminergic neurons against MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity. A protective effect of &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; deletion was demonstrated in organotypic slice cultures of mouse midbrain exposed to MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in mice subjected to intrastriatal injections of MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Seven days after intrastriatal MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; injections, the population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in substantia nigra is reduced by 48% in &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice compared with 67% in WT littermates. Our results show that AQP9 –selectively expressed in catecholaminergic neurons—is permeable to MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and suggest that this aquaglyceroporin contributes to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic neurons by providing an entry route for parkinsonogenic toxins. To our knowledge this is the first evidence implicating a toxin permeable membrane channel in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Katja Stahl, Soulmaz Rahmani, Agnete Prydz, Nadia Skauli, Nanna MacAulay, Maria N.

Background &lt;p&gt;Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) refers to a cluster of metabolic disturbances which is associated with increased risk for vascular and degenerative conditions in general population. Although the relationship between vascular risk factors and dementia is undisputable, additional hazard for cognitive decline in older population with concurrent metabolic disorders still waits to be demonstrated. The present review aims to analyze data on MetS and risk for cognitive decline in elderly persons.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Database searches were performed in Medline, ISI and PsycINFO for articles assessing cognitive performances of older subjects with MetS.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of a total of 505 studies, 25 were selected for the review. Risk of selection biases was identified in all the studies. Although all articles followed recognized diagnostic recommendations for MetS, minor criteria modifications were detected in most of them. Hyperglycemia was consistently associated with impaired cognitive performances in older individuals, but the role of MetS for cognitive decline and for the onset of dementia showed heterogeneous results.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Current available data in the literature concerning the impact of MetS on the cognition of older population is inconclusive and based on inconsistent evidence. Differential effects of individual MetS components and factors associated with the age of the sample may have accounted for divergent findings among articles, but larger and higher quality studies in this field are still needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naima Assuncao, Felipe Kenji Sudo, Claudia Drummond, Fernanda Guarino de Felice, Paulo Mattos&lt;/p&gt;

LdtR is a master regulator of gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Liberibacter asiaticus&lt;/i&gt;, one of the causative agents of citrus greening disease. LdtR belongs to the MarR-family of transcriptional regulators and it has been linked to the regulation of more than 180 genes in &lt;i&gt;Liberibacter&lt;/i&gt; species, most of them gathered in the following Clusters of Orthologous Groups: cell motility, cell wall envelope, energy production, and transcription. Our previous transcriptomic evidence suggested that LdtR is directly involved in the modulation of the zinc uptake system genes (&lt;i&gt;znu&lt;/i&gt;) in the closely related &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;crescens&lt;/i&gt;. In this report, we show that LdtR is involved in the regulation of one of the two encoded zinc uptake mechanisms in &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;asiaticus&lt;/i&gt;, named &lt;i&gt;znu&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We also show that LdtR binds zinc with higher affinity than benzbromarone, a synthetic effector inhibitory molecule, resulting in the disruption of the LdtR:promoter interactions. Using site-directed mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), and isothermal titration calorimetry, we identified that residues C28 and T43 in LdtR, located in close proximity to the Benz1 pocket, are involved in the interaction with zinc. These results provided new evidence of a high-affinity effector molecule targeting a key player in &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;asiaticus&lt;/i&gt;’ physiology and complemented our previous findings about the mechanisms of signal transduction in members of the MarR-family.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fernando A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) often experience abnormal facial growth. Three-dimensional (3D) assessment of dentofacial growth deviation has become more common with advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies. However, no standardized guidelines exist for interpretation of 3D imaging in patients with JIA. The aim of this study was to propose and validate morphometric measures for the 3D radiographic assessment of dentofacial growth deviation in patients with JIA to enhance: 1) Description of dentofacial growth deviation; 2) Treatment planning; 3) Longitudinal follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in a standardized sequential-phased approach involving: 1) Preliminary decision-making; 2) Item generation; 3) Test of content-validity; 4) Test of reliability; 5) Test of construct validity; 6) Establishment of final recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one morphometric measures were evaluated. Based on results of reliability and validity-testing including subjects with JIA (n = 70) and non-JIA controls (n = 19), seven measures received a “high recommendation” score. Those measures were associated with posterior mandibular height, occlusal cant, mandibular asymmetry, mandibular inclination, and anterior/posterior lower face height. Nine other measures were “moderately recommended” and five received a “somewhat recommendation” score.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Seven morphometric measures were considered very useful in the 3D assessment of growth deviation in patients with TMJ disease associated with JIA. These variables can be used to standardize the description of dentofacial deformities and to plan corrective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Stoustrup, Christian Kerting Iversen, Kasper Dahl Kristensen, Cory M.

Based on results of reliability and validity-testing including subjects with JIA (n = 70) and non-JIA controls (n = 19), seven measures received a “high recommendation” score. Those measures were associated with posterior mandibular height, occlusal cant, mandibular asymmetry, mandibular inclination, and anterior/posterior lower face height. Nine other measures were “moderately recommended” and five received a “somewhat recommendation” score.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Seven morphometric measures were considered very useful in the 3D assessment of growth deviation in patients with TMJ disease associated with JIA. These variables can be used to standardize the description of dentofacial deformities and to plan corrective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1523554636000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Climate effects of aerosol cleanup</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:feced0:34f43e70</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-q?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/166.17.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-q?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>e7abb08b</fingerprint><author><name>Fahrenkamp-Uppenbrink, J.</name></author><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-q?rss=1</link></item><item><published>1521061200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194375</canonicalUrl><updated>1521061200000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194375</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16225a89689:4e33a1:9f3b30f2</id><title>Collision-based energetic comparison of rolling and hopping over obstacles</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194375</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>fa5f9151</fingerprint><author><name>Fabio Giardina</name></author><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194375</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Giardina, Fumiya Iida&lt;/p&gt;
Locomotion of machines and robots operating in rough terrain is strongly influenced by the mechanics of the ground-machine interactions. A rolling wheel in terrain with obstacles is subject to collisional energy losses, which is governed by mechanics comparable to hopping or walking locomotion. Here we investigate the energetic cost associated with overcoming an obstacle for rolling and hopping locomotion, using a simple mechanics model. The model considers collision-based interactions with the ground and the obstacle, without frictional losses, and we quantify, analyse, and compare the sources of energetic costs for three locomotion strategies. Our results show that the energetic advantages of the locomotion strategies are uniquely defined given the moment of inertia and the Froude number associated with the system. We find that hopping outperforms rolling at larger Froude numbers and vice versa. The analysis is further extended for a comparative study with animals. By applying size and inertial properties through an allometric scaling law of hopping and trotting animals to our models, we found that the conditions at which hopping becomes energetically advantageous to rolling roughly corresponds to animals’ preferred gait transition speeds. The energetic collision losses as predicted by the model are largely verified experimentally.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Giardina, Fumiya Iida&lt;/p&gt;

Ethanol (ET) is a substance that modulates the Central Nervous System (CNS). Frequently, ET intake occurs combined with energy drinks, which contain taurine (TA), an important amino acid found in the body (i.e brain and muscles). Although TA administration has been used in the improvement of physical performance, the impact of TA, ET and exercise remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the acute effect of 6g of Taurine (TA), 0.6 mL∙kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of Ethanol (ET), and Taurine combined with Ethanol (TA+ET) ingestion on the electrocortical activity before and after a moderate intensity exercise in 9 subjects, 5 women (counterbalanced experimental design). In each of the 4 treatments (Placebo—PL, TA, ET and TA+ET), electroencephalography (EEG) tests were conducted in order to analyze changes in absolute beta power (ABP) in the frontal lobe in 3 moments: baseline (before ingestion), peak (before exercise) and post-exercise. In the PL treatment, the frontal areas showed decrease in ABP after exercise. However, in the ET+TA treatment, ABP values were greater after exercise, except for Fp1. The ET treatment had no effect on the Superior Frontal Gyrus area (F3, Fz and F4) and ABP decreased after exercise in Fp1 and Fp2. In the TA treatment, ABP increased after exercise, while it decreased at the peak moment in most of the frontal regions, except for Fp1, F3 and Fz. We concluded that after a moderate intensity exercise, a decrease in cortical activity occurs in placebo treatment. Moreover, we found a inhibitory effect of TA on cortical activity before exercise and a increased in cortical activity after exercise. A small ET dose is not enough to alter ABP in all regions of the frontal cortex and, in combination with TA, it showed an increase in the frontal cortex activity at the post-exercise moment.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dailson Paulucio, Augusto Terra, Caleb G.

Fungal communities in agricultural soils are assumed to be affected by soil and crop management. Our intention was to investigate the impact of different tillage and fertilization practices on fungal communities in a long-term crop rotation field trial established in 1992 in Central Germany. Two winter wheat fields in replicated strip-tillage design, comprising conventional &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. conservation tillage, intensive &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. extensive fertilization and different pre-crops (maize &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. rapeseed) were analyzed by a metabarcoding approach applying Illumina paired-end sequencing of amplicons generated by two recently developed primer pairs targeting the two fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2). Analysis of 5.1 million high-quality sequence reads uncovered a diverse fungal community in the two fields, composed of 296 fungal genera including 3,398 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at the 97% sequence similarity threshold. Both primer pairs detected the same fungal phyla (&lt;i&gt;Basidio&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Asco&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Zygo&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Glomero&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Chytridiomycota&lt;/i&gt;), but in different relative abundances. OTU richness was higher in the ITS1 dataset, while ITS2 data were more diverse and of higher evenness. Effects of farming practice on fungal community structures were revealed. Almost two-thirds of the fungal genera were represented in all different soil treatments, whereas the remaining genera clearly responded to farming practice. Principal Component Analysis revealed four distinct clusters according to tillage practice and pre-crop. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) substantiated the results and proved significant influences of tillage and pre-crop, while fertilization had the smallest and non-significant effect. In-depth analysis of putative phytopathogenic and plant beneficial fungal groups indicated distinct responses; for example &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; was significantly enriched in the intensively fertilized conservation tillage variants with the pre-crop maize, while &lt;i&gt;Phoma&lt;/i&gt; displayed significant association with conventional tillage and pre-crop rapeseed. Many putative plant beneficial fungi also reacted differentially to farming practice with the most distinct responders identified among the &lt;i&gt;Glomeromycota&lt;/i&gt; (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF).</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Loreen Sommermann, Joerg Geistlinger, Daniel Wibberg, Annette Deubel, Jessica Zwanzig, Doreen Babin, Andreas Schlüter, Ingo Schellenberg&lt;/p&gt;

This diversity has shown two faces: the expression dynamics (gene to gene variability) can be quantified more accurately, thanks to the measurement of lowly-expressed genes. Second, the cell-to-cell variability is high, with a low proportion of cells expressing the same gene at the same time/level. Those emerging patterns appear to be very challenging from the statistical point of view, especially to represent and to provide a summarized view of single-cell expression data. PCA is one of the most powerful framework to provide a suitable representation of high dimensional datasets, by searching for new axis catching the most variability in the data. Unfortunately, classical PCA is based on Euclidean distances and projections that work poorly in presence of over-dispersed counts that show zero-inflation.

This diversity has shown two faces: the expression dynamics (gene to gene variability) can be quantified more accurately, thanks to the measurement of lowly-expressed genes. Second, the cell-to-cell variability is high, with a low proportion of cells expressing the same gene at the same time/level. Those emerging patterns appear to be very challenging from the statistical point of view, especially to represent and to provide a summarized view of single-cell expression data. PCA is one of the most powerful framework to provide a suitable representation of high dimensional datasets, by searching for new axis catching the most variability in the data. Unfortunately, classical PCA is based on Euclidean distances and projections that work poorly in presence of over-dispersed counts that show zero-inflation.

Higher trophic-level species are an integral component of any marine ecosystem. Despite their importance, methods for representing these species in end-to-end ecosystem models often have limited representation of life histories, energetics and behaviour. We built an individual-based model coupled with a dynamic energy budget for female southern elephant seals &lt;i&gt;Mirounga leonina&lt;/i&gt; to demonstrate a method for detailed representation of marine mammals. We aimed to develop a model which could i) simulate energy use and life histories, as well as breeding traits of southern elephant seals in an emergent manner, ii) project a stable population over time, and iii) have realistic population dynamics and structure based on emergent life history features (such as age at first breeding, lifespan, fecundity and (yearling) survival). We evaluated the model’s ability to represent a stable population over long time periods (&gt;10 generations), including the sensitivity of the emergent properties to variations in key parameters. Analyses indicated that the model is sensitive to changes in resource availability and energy requirements for the transition from pup to juvenile, and juvenile to adult stage. This was particularly the case for breeding success and yearling survival. This model is suitable for use as a standalone tool for investigating the impacts of changes to behaviour and population responses of southern elephant seals.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Merel Goedegebuure, Jessica Melbourne-Thomas, Stuart P.

Competitive pressure to maximize the current bibliometric measures of productivity is jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific literature. Efforts are underway to address the ‘reproducibility crisis’ by encouraging the use of more rigorous, confirmatory methods. However, as long as productivity continues to be defined by the number of discoveries scientists publish, the impact factor of the journals they publish in and the number of times their papers are cited, they will be reluctant to accept high quality methods and consistently conduct and publish confirmatory/replication studies. This exploratory study examined a sample of rigorous Phase II-IV clinical trials, including unpublished studies, to determine if more appropriate metrics and incentives can be developed. The results suggest that rigorous procedures will help reduce false positives, but to the extent that higher quality methods are accepted as the standard of practice, the current bibliometric incentives will discourage innovative studies and encourage scientists to shift their research to less informative studies of subjects that are already being more actively investigated. However, the results also suggest that it is possible to develop a more appropriate system of rewards. In contrast to the current bibliometric incentives, evaluations of the quality of the methods and reproducibility of the results, innovation and diversity of thought, and amount of information produced may serve as measures and incentives that maintain the integrity of the scientific literature and maximize scientific progress.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mark D.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In 2009, China officially launched the New Health Care Reform (NHCR). One important purpose of the reform was to reduce financial burden of health care through health insurance expansion and health care provider regulations. This study aimed to provide evidence on the effect of the NHCR reform on catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) by comparing the occurrence and inequality of CHE among households with chronic diseases patients before and after the reform.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study used the subset of data from the 2008 and 2013 National Health Services Survey conducted in Shaanxi Province. Our sample included households with chronic diseases patients and excluded observations with key variables missing. The final sample size was 1942 households in 2008 and 7704 households in 2013. We defined CHE occurrence following the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO). The income-related inequality in CHE was measured by the concentration index. A multi-level logistic regression model was used in the study to explore the influence of the NHCR on CHE occurrence, controlling for important covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2008 to 2013, the occurrence rate of CHE in rural areas declined from 29.15% to 23.62%. However, the CHE rate in urban areas increased from 19.18% to 24.95%. The interaction term between year and rural/urban location was statistically significant, confirming that the influence of the NHCR on the CHE occurrence rates were heterogeneous between rural and urban areas. As for the CHE inequality, the concentration index in rural areas decreased from -0.4572 to -0.5499 with a p-value less than 0.05. This implied that the CHE occurrence inequality was increased after the implementation of the NHCR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study suggested that the implementation of the NHCR might not have been effective in reducing the CHE occurrence for households with chronic disease patients. Although the occurrence of CHE of rural households had decreased, the occurrence of CHE in urban areas was higher than before. In addition, the income inequality of CHE occurrence was greater in 2013 compared to that in 2008 in rural areas. Although the reform resulted in higher insurance coverage and higher government expenditure in health care, the financial burden of health care on households did not necessarily improve. Further efforts on developing the current health insurance system and optimizing the hierarchical health care system are required to improve the protection against CHE.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yongjian Xu, Jie Ma, Na Wu, Xiaojing Fan, Tao Zhang, Zhongliang Zhou, Jianmin Gao, Jianping Ren, Gang Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Agreed international development standards underpin high quality &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). There is however, no international consensus on how high quality CPGs should ‘look’; or on whether high quality CPGs from one country can be viably implemented elsewhere. Writing d&lt;i&gt;e novo&lt;/i&gt; CPGs is generally resource-intensive and expensive, making this challenging in resource-poor environments. This paper proposes an alternative, efficient method of producing high quality CPGs in such circumstances, using existing CPGs layered by local knowledge, contexts and products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We undertook a mixed methods case study in South African (SA) primary healthcare (PHC), building on findings from four independent studies. These comprised an overview of international CPG activities; a rapid literature review on international CPG development practices; critical appraisal of 16 purposively-sampled SA PHC CPGs; and additional interrogation of these CPGs regarding how, why and for whom, they had been produced, and how they ‘looked’.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Despite a common aim to improve SA PHC healthcare practices, the included CPGs had different, unclear and inconsistent production processes, terminology and evidence presentation styles. None aligned with international quality standards. However many included innovative succinct guidance for end-users (which we classified as evidence-based summary recommendations, patient management tools or protocols).

Background &lt;p&gt;Agreed international development standards underpin high quality &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). There is however, no international consensus on how high quality CPGs should ‘look’; or on whether high quality CPGs from one country can be viably implemented elsewhere. Writing d&lt;i&gt;e novo&lt;/i&gt; CPGs is generally resource-intensive and expensive, making this challenging in resource-poor environments. This paper proposes an alternative, efficient method of producing high quality CPGs in such circumstances, using existing CPGs layered by local knowledge, contexts and products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We undertook a mixed methods case study in South African (SA) primary healthcare (PHC), building on findings from four independent studies. These comprised an overview of international CPG activities; a rapid literature review on international CPG development practices; critical appraisal of 16 purposively-sampled SA PHC CPGs; and additional interrogation of these CPGs regarding how, why and for whom, they had been produced, and how they ‘looked’.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Despite a common aim to improve SA PHC healthcare practices, the included CPGs had different, unclear and inconsistent production processes, terminology and evidence presentation styles. None aligned with international quality standards. However many included innovative succinct guidance for end-users (which we classified as evidence-based summary recommendations, patient management tools or protocols). We developed a three-tiered model, a checklist and a glossary of common terms, for more efficient future production of better quality, contextually-relevant, locally-implementable SA PHC CPGs. Tier 1 involves transparent synthesis of existing high quality CPG recommendations; Tier 2 reflects local expertise to layer Tier 1 evidence with local contexts; and Tier 3 comprises tailored locally-relevant end-user guidance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our model could be relevant for any resource-poor environment. It should reduce effort and costs in finding and synthesising available research evidence, whilst efficiently focusing scant resources on contextually-relevant evidence-based guidance, and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1523566800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195780</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66c7:9f3b30f2</id><title>Unraveling endothelin-1 induced hypercontractility of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195780</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>64c6b76d</fingerprint><author><name>Jamie L.

Contraction of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMC) isolated from pulmonary arterial hypertensive (PAH) and normal (non-PAH) subject lungs was determined and measured with real-time electrical impedance. Treatment of HPASMC with vasoactive peptides, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and bradykinin (BK) but not angiotensin II, induced a temporal decrease in the electrical impedance profile mirroring constrictive morphological change of the cells which typically was more robust in PAH as opposed to non-PAH cells. Inhibition with LIMKi3 and a cofilin targeted motif mimicking cell permeable peptide (MMCPP) had no effect on ET-1 induced HPASMC contraction indicating a negligible role for these actin regulatory proteins. On the other hand, a MMCPP blocking the activity of caldesmon reduced ET-1 promoted contraction pointing to a regulatory role of this protein and its activation pathway in HPASMC contraction. Inhibition of this MEK/ERK/p90RSK pathway, which is an upstream regulator of caldesmon phosphorylation, reduced ET-1 induced cell contraction. While the regulation of ET-1 induced cell contraction was found to be similar in PAH and non-PAH cells, a key difference was the response to pharmacological inhibitors and to siRNA knockdown of Rho kinases (ROCK1/ROCK2). The PAH cells required much higher concentrations of inhibitors to abrogate ET-1 induced contractions and their contraction was not affected by siRNA against either ROCK1 or ROCK2. Lastly, blocking of L-type and T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels had no effect on ET-1 or BK induced contraction. However, inhibiting the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase blunted ET-1 and BK induced HPASMC contraction in both PAH and non-PAH derived HPASMC. In summary, our findings here together with previous communications illustrate similarities and differences in the regulation PAH and non-PAH smooth muscle cell contraction relating to calcium translocation, RhoA/ROCK signaling and the activity of caldesmon. These findings may provide useful tools in achieving the regulation of the vascular hypercontractility taking place in PAH.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jamie L.

Network analysis of large metagenomic datasets generated by current sequencing technologies can reveal significant co-occurrence patterns between microbial species of a biological community. These patterns can be analyzed in terms of pairwise combinations between all species comprising a community. Here, we construct a co-occurrence network for abundant microbial species encompassing the three dominant phyla found in human gut. This was followed by an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; evaluation of the predicted microbe-microbe co-occurrences, where we chose species pairs &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium adolescentis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Roseburia inulinivorans&lt;/i&gt; as model organisms for our study. We then delineate the outcome of the co-cultures when equal distributions of resources were provided. The growth behavior of the co-culture was found to be dependent on the types of microbial species present, their specific metabolic activities, and resulting changes in the culture environment. Through this reductionist approach and using novel &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; combinations of microbial species under anaerobic conditions, the results of this work will aid in the understanding and design of synthetic community formulations.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Promi Das, Boyang Ji, Petia Kovatcheva-Datchary, Fredrik Bäckhed, Jens Nielsen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allylmercapto-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine (ASSNAC) was shown in our previous study to activate Nrf2-mediated processes and increase glutathione level and resistance to oxidative stress in cultured endothelial cells. In this study, we explored the antioxidant protective effect of ASSNAC in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans)&lt;/i&gt;. Treatment of &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter strain (CL2166) with increasing concentrations of ASSNAC (0.2 to 20 mM) for 24 hours and with ASSNAC (10 mM) for various time periods demonstrated a significant concentration- and time-dependent increase in Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene expression (up to 60-fold at 20 mM after 24 hours). In addition, ASSNAC (2 mM; 24 hours) treatment of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; strains N2 (wild type strain), &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter (CL2166) and temperature sensitive sterile strain (CF512) significantly increased GST enzyme activity by 1.9-, 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively. ASSNAC (2.0 mM; 24 hours) increased the reduced glutathione content in N2 and CF512 strains by 5.9- and 4.9-fold, respectively. Exposure of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; (N2 strain) to a lethal concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.5 mM; 120 min) resulted in death of 88% of the nematodes while pretreatment with ASSNAC (24 hours) reduced nematodes death in a concentration-dependent manner down to 8% at 2.0 mM. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes (strain CF512) cultured on agar plates containing ASSNAC (0.5 to 5.0 mM) demonstrated a significant increase in lifespan compared to control (mean lifespan 26.45 ± 0.64 versus 22.90 ± 0.59 days; log-rank p ≤ 0.001 at 2.0 mM) with a maximal lifespan of 40 versus 36 days. In conclusion, ASSNAC up-regulates the GST gene expression and enzyme activity as well as the glutathione content in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes and thereby increases their resistance to oxidative stress and extends their lifespan.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naphtali Savion, Amir Levine, Shlomo Kotev-Emeth, Ulrike Bening Abu-Shach, Limor Broday&lt;/p&gt;

In conclusion, ASSNAC up-regulates the GST gene expression and enzyme activity as well as the glutathione content in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes and thereby increases their resistance to oxidative stress and extends their lifespan.</content></content></item><item><published>1523516400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23428-w</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b924a6a3:c62b99:34f43e70</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23428-w</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/4dpbJCqFQxk/s41598-018-23428-w</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>adcf3510</fingerprint><author><name>Ao Li</name></author><crawled>1523524609699</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23428-w</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23428-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23428-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/4dpbJCqFQxk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23428-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23428-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/4dpbJCqFQxk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522047600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>NeatSeq-Flow: A Lightweight High Throughput Sequencing Workflow Platform for Non-Programmers and Programmers alike [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/173005v2?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16263ce4ae1:5b801df:7d6c1c1c</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/26/173005</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/173005v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>4dd31e53</fingerprint><author><name>Sklarz, M.

Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are revealing the genetic architecture of anthropomorphic and biomedical traits, i.e., the frequencies and effect sizes of variants that contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To interpret these findings, we need to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population genetics processes—notably, by mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Because many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and because genetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model the genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing selection in a multidimensional trait space. We solve the model for the phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust, closed-form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our results provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it varies among traits. They predict that the distribution of variances contributed by loci identified in GWASs is well approximated by a simple functional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution to genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test this prediction against the results of GWASs for height and body mass index (BMI) and find that it fits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of pleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than the similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the increase in explained heritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic history of European populations, in which these GWASs were performed, we further find that most of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that arose shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck at sites with selection coefficients around &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8BI0l7B3nAc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuval B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is an emerging biomarker for risk stratification in cardiovascular disease. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this retrospectively observational study, we aimed to determine the role of GDF-15 and the risk of AKI in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The medical records of 1195 patients with AMI were reviewed. After exclusion criteria, a total of 751 eligible patients who underwent CAG or PCI were studied. Preoperative clinical parameters including GDF-15 levels were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors of AKI. Subsequently, to reduce a potential selection bias and to balance differences between the two groups, a propensity score-matched analysis was performed. We recorded the 30-day all-cause mortality of the total study population. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to identify the association between short term survival in AMI patients and GDF-15 level.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 751 enrolled patients, 106 patients (14.1%) developed AKI. Patients were divided into two groups: AKI group (n = 106) and non-AKI group (n = 645). GDF-15 levels were significantly higher in AKI group compared to non-AKI group (1328.2 ± 349.7 ng/L vs. 1113.0 ± 371.3 ng/L, P &amp;lt;0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed GDF-15 was an independent risk factor of AKI (per 1000 ng/L increase of GDF-15, OR: 3.740, 95% CI: 1.940–7.207, P &amp;lt; 0.001). According to GDF-15 tertiles, patients were divided into three groups. Patients in middle (OR 2.93, 95% CI: 1.46–5.89, P = 0.003) and highest GDF-15 tertile (OR 3.72, 95% CI: 1.87–7.39, P &amp;lt;0.001) had higher risk of AKI compared to patients in the lowest GDF-15 tertile. The propensity score-matched group set comprised of 212 patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that GDF-15 is still an independent risk factor for AKI after matching (per 1000 ng/L increase of GDF-15, OR: 2.395, 95% CI: 1.020–5.626, P = 0.045). Based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the risk of 30-day all-cause mortality increased in higher GDF-15 tertiles log rank chi-square: 29.895, P &amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This suggests that preoperative plasma GDF-15 is an independent risk factor of AKI in AMI patients underwent CAG or PCI. GDF-15 and AKI are associated with poor short term survival of AMI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ling Sun, Xuejun Zhou, Jianguang Jiang, Xuan Zang, Xin Chen, Haiyan Li, Haitao Cao, Qingjie Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the risk of 30-day all-cause mortality increased in higher GDF-15 tertiles log rank chi-square: 29.895, P &amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This suggests that preoperative plasma GDF-15 is an independent risk factor of AKI in AMI patients underwent CAG or PCI. GDF-15 and AKI are associated with poor short term survival of AMI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1523516400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>DREAM-Yara: An exact read mapper for very large databaseswith short update time [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256354v2?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162bb2b6aba:1017e7c:9f3b30f2</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/12/256354</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256354v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>4d29007e</fingerprint><author><name>Dadi, T.

L-carnitine is important for the catabolism of long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria. We investigated how the triacylglycerol (TAG)-lowering drug 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) influenced lipid metabolism in carnitine-depleted, 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium)propionate dehydrate (Mildronate; meldonium)-treated male Wistar rats. As indicated, carnitine biosynthesis was impaired by Mildronate. However, TAG levels of both plasma and liver were decreased by 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated animals. This was accompanied by increased gene expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial activity and proliferation and reduced mRNA levels of &lt;i&gt;Dgat2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ApoB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ApoCIII&lt;/i&gt; in liver. The hepatic energy state was reduced in the group of Mildronate and 1-triple TTA as reflected by increased AMP/ATP ratio, reduced energy charge and induced gene expression of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3. The increase in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation was observed despite low plasma carnitine levels, and was linked to strongly induced gene expression of carnitine acetyltransferase, translocase and carnitine transporter, suggesting an efficient carnitine turnover. The present data suggest that the plasma TAG-lowering effect of 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated rats is not only due to increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation reflected by increased mitochondrial biogenesis, but also to changes in plasma clearance and reduced TAG biosynthesis.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Carine Lindquist, Bodil Bjørndal, Christine Renate Rossmann, Asbjørn Svardal, Seth Hallström, Rolf Kristian Berge&lt;/p&gt;

This task can be computationally challenging due to the presence of local optima and ill-conditioning. While a variety of optimization methods have been suggested to surmount these issues, it is not obvious how to choose the best one for a given problem a priori, since many factors can influence their performance. A systematic comparison of methods that are suited to parameter estimation problems of sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of optimization variables is currently missing, and smaller studies indeed provided contradictory findings. Results: Here, we use a collection of benchmark problems to evaluate the performance of two families of optimization methods: (i) a multi-start of deterministic local searches; and (ii) a hybrid metaheuristic combining stochastic global search with deterministic local searches. A fair comparison is ensured through a collaborative evaluation, involving researchers applying each method on a daily basis, and a consideration of multiple performance metrics capturing the trade-off between computational efficiency and robustness. Our results show that, thanks to recent advances in the calculation of parametric sensitivities, a multi-start of gradient-based local methods is often a successful strategy, but a better performance can be obtained with a hybrid metaheuristic. The best performer is a combination of a global scatter search metaheuristic with an interior point local method, provided with gradients estimated with adjoint-based sensitivities. We provide an implementation of this novel method in an open-source software toolbox to render it available to the scientific community.

Traditional peptide identification algorithms perform well when identifying unmodified peptides. However, when peptides have post-translational modifications (PTMs), these methods cannot provide satisfactory results. Recently, Chick et al., 2015 and Yu et al., 2016 proposed the spectrum-based and tag-based open search methods, respectively, to identify peptides with PTMs. While the performance of these two methods is promising, the identification results vary greatly with respect to the quality of tandem mass spectra and the number of PTMs in peptides. This motivates us to systematically study the relationship between the performance of open search methods and quality parameters of tandem mass spectrum data, as well as the number of PTMs in peptides. Results: Through large-scale simulations, we obtain the performance trend when simulated tandem mass spectra are of different quality. We propose an analytical model to describe the relationship between the probability of obtaining correct identifications and the spectrum quality as well as the number of PTMs. Based on the analytical model, we can quantitatively describe the necessary condition to effectively apply open search methods.

Materials and methods; A total of 334 patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging before ultrasonography-guided transrectal 12-core prostate biopsy were enrolled in the analysis. Twenty-two non-selected variables as well as selected ones by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis and by stepwise logistic regression analysis were input into the constructed multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) programs. 232 patients were used as training cases of ANN programs, and the remaining 102 patients were for the test to output the probability of prostate cancer existence, accuracy of prostate cancer prediction, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the learned model. Results; With any prostate cancer objective variable, Lasso and stepwise regression analyses selected 12 and 9 explanatory variables from 22, respectively. In common between them, age at biopsy, findings on digital rectal examination, findings in the peripheral zone on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging, and body mass index were positively influential variables, while numbers of previous prostatic biopsy and prostate volume were negatively influential. Using trained ANNs with multiple hidden layers, the accuracy of predicting any prostate cancer in test samples was about 5-10% higher compared with that with logistic regression analysis (LR). The AUCs with multilayer ANN were significantly larger on inputting variables that were selected by the stepwise logistic regression compared with the AUC with LR. The ANN had a higher net-benefit than LR between prostate cancer probability cut-off values of 0.38 and 0.6. Conclusion; ANN accurately predicted prostate cancer without biopsy marginally better than LR. However, for clinical application, ANN performance may still need improvement.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Objectives; To predict the rate of prostate cancer detection on prostate biopsy more accurately, the performance of deep learning utilizing a multilayer artificial neural network was investigated.

It is generally believed that the unencapsulated sensory nerve terminals of modality specific C- and Aδ-neurons lack structural specialization. Here we determined the morphology of functionally defined polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors in the guinea pig corneal epithelium. Polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors were identified by extracellular recording at the surface of the corneal epithelium. After marking the recording sites, corneas were processed to reveal immunoreactivity for the transient receptor potential channels TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1) or TPRM8 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8). Polymodal receptor nerve terminals (n = 6) were TRPV1-immunoreactive and derived from an axon that ascended from the sub-basal plexus to the squamous cell layer where it branched into fibers that ran parallel to the corneal surface and terminated with small bulbar endings (ramifying endings). Cold thermoreceptor nerve terminals were TRPM8-immunoreactive (n = 6) and originated from an axon that branched as it ascended through the wing cell and squamous cell layers and terminated with large bulbar endings (complex endings). These findings indicate that modality specific corneal sensory neurons with unencapsulated nerve endings have distinct nerve terminal morphologies that are likely to relate to their function.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Abdulhakeem S.

Both stem cell therapy and physical treatments have been shown to be beneficial in accelerating bone healing. However, the efficacy of combined treatment with stem cells and physical stimuli for large bone defects remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone regeneration effects of low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) and human adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) treatments during fracture repair using a comparative rat calvarial defect model. We evaluated the viability of human ADSCs, which were cultured on a porous PLGA scaffold using an MTS assay. The critical-sized calvarial bone defect rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, LPLI group, ADSC group, and ADSC+LPLI group. Bone formation was evaluated using micro-CT. New bone formation areas and osteogenic factor expression levels were then examined by histomorphological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Our data showed that PLGA had no cytotoxic effect on human ADSCs. Micro-CT analyses revealed that both the LPLI and ADSC groups showed improved calvarial bone defect healing compared to the control group. In addition, the ADSC+LPLI group showed significantly increased bone volume at 16 weeks after surgery. The area of new bone formation ranked as follows: control group &amp;lt; LPLI group &amp;lt; ADSC group &amp;lt; ADSC+LPLI group. There were significant differences between the groups. In addition, both ADSC and ADSC+LPLI groups showed strong signals of vWF expression. ADSC and LPLI treatments improved fracture repair in critical-sized calvarial defects in rats. Importantly, the combined treatment of ADSCs and LPLI further enhances the bone healing process.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yan-Hsiung Wang, Jyun-Yi Wu, Su Chii Kong, Min-Hsuan Chiang, Mei-Ling Ho, Ming-Long Yeh, Chia-Hsin Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Our human model of nasal colonization and eradication of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; is limited by safety issues. As rhesus macaques are closely related to humans and natural hosts for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;, we developed an experimental decolonization and inoculation protocol in these animals. Animals were screened for nasal carriage of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; and 20 carriers were selected. Decolonization was attempted using nasal mupirocin (10 animals) or mupirocin plus trimethoprim/sulfadiazine intramuscularly (10 animals) both once daily for 5 days, and checked by follow-up cultures for 10 weeks. Intranasal inoculation was performed with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; strain 8325–4 in culture-negative animals. 11/20 animals, of which 5 received mupirocin and 6 the combination treatment, became culture-negative for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; for 10 weeks and these 11 animals were subsequently inoculated. Swabs were taken once a week for 5 weeks to test for the presence of the inoculated strain. In 3 animals, strain 8325–4 was cultured from the nose 1 week after inoculation, indicating short-term survival of this strain only, a finding similar to that previously found in our human model.

In this study, individuals estimated interval times of several minutes (from 2 to 32 minutes) during their everyday lives using a cell phone they kept with them. Their emotional state, the difficulty of the activity performed during this interval, and the attention that it required were also assessed, together with their subjective experience of the passage of time. The results showed that the mean time estimates and their variability increased linearly with increasing interval duration, indicating that the fundamental scalar property of time found for short durations also applies to very long durations of several minutes. In addition, the emotional state and difficulty of the activity were significant predictors of the judgment of long durations. However, the awareness of the passage of time appeared to play a crucial role in the judgment of very long duration in humans.

Their emotional state, the difficulty of the activity performed during this interval, and the attention that it required were also assessed, together with their subjective experience of the passage of time. The results showed that the mean time estimates and their variability increased linearly with increasing interval duration, indicating that the fundamental scalar property of time found for short durations also applies to very long durations of several minutes. In addition, the emotional state and difficulty of the activity were significant predictors of the judgment of long durations. However, the awareness of the passage of time appeared to play a crucial role in the judgment of very long duration in humans. A theory on the emergence of the awareness of the passage of time and how it affects the judgment of interval durations lasting several minutes is therefore discussed.</content></content></item><item><published>1521147600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194466</canonicalUrl><updated>1521147600000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194466</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a622:9f3b30f2</id><title>Decline in perception of acid regurgitation symptoms from gastroesophageal reflux disease in diabetes mellitus patients</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194466</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>5e034a75</fingerprint><author><name>Kosuke Sakitani</name></author><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194466</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kosuke Sakitani, Nobumi Suzuki, Sozaburo Ihara, Yoshihiro Hirata, Shoji Kawazu, Yasuhiko Iwamoto, Kazuhiko Koike&lt;/p&gt;
Objectives &lt;p&gt;To determine if a discrepancy exists between subjective symptoms and the grade of endoscopic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;All 2,884 patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy completed the modified Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), an interview-based rating scale consisting of 16 items including a question on acid regurgitation. Patients were divided into DM and non-DM groups (1,135 and 1,749 patients, respectively). GERD was diagnosed endoscopically and graded according to the Los Angeles classification. Grade B or more severe GERD was defined as severe endoscopic GERD. The intergroup GSRS score was compared statistically.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In severe endoscopic GERD patients, the prevalence of patients with a positive GSRS score in the acid regurgitation question was statistically lower in DM patients than non-DM patients. Of the 60 non-DM patients with severe endoscopic GERD, 40 patients (67%) had a positive GSRS score for acid regurgitation; however, of the 51 DM patients with severe endoscopic GERD, 23 patients (45%) had a positive GSRS score. Multivariate analysis showed that severe endoscopic GERD (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.21–3.33; p = 0.0066), non-DM (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.54–0.94; p = 0.0157), younger age (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97–0.99; p = 0.0125), and hiatal hernia (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.12–1.90; p = 0.0042) were associated with acid regurgitation symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is a discrepancy between subjective symptoms and endoscopic GERD grade in DM patients.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Azathioprine is a widely used immunosuppressive drug. Genetic polymorphisms and activity of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) have been associated with azathioprine efficacy and toxicity in several populations. We investigated whether these associations also exist for ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) patients, who receive azathioprine maintenance therapy after remission induction with cyclophosphamide.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;207 AAV patients treated with cyclophosphamide induction and azathioprine maintenance therapy were included and followed for 60 months. &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype and tertiles of TPMT activity were compared to relapse free survival and occurrence of adverse events, particularly leukopenia. Multivariable regression was performed to account for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In univariable analysis, relapse free survival was not significantly associated with &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype (P = 0.41) or TPMT activity (P = 0.07), although it tended to be longer in lower tertiles of TPMT activity. There was no significant association of TPMT genotype and activity with occurrence of any adverse event. In multiple regression, leukocyte counts at the end of cyclophosphamide induction were related to risk of leukopenia during azathioprine therapy [P&amp;lt;0.001; OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.43–0.68)] and risk of relapse during follow-up [P = 0.001; HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.07–1.29)] irrespective of TMPT genotype or activity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;TPMT genotype and activity were not independent predictors of relapse, and could not predict leukopenia or other adverse effects from azathioprine. Leukocyte counts after cyclophosphamide induction were related to both outcomes, implying a greater influence of cyclophosphamide response compared to azathioprine and TPMT in AAV patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arno C.

There has been an increasing realisation that young infants are exposed to elevated concentrations of the carcinogen inorganic arsenic, relative to adults. This is because many infant food products are rice based, and rice is ~10-fold elevated in inorganic arsenic compared to most other foods. The European Commission (EC) has acted on this concern setting stricter standards for infants, 100 μg of inorganic arsenic per kg of food (100 μg/kg), as compared to adults (200 μg/kg), for rice based foods, a law that was brought into place in 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; January 2016. Here we investigate how this law has impacted on inorganic arsenic in baby food products in the UK market, and compare the findings to previous baby food surveys taken before and just after the law came into place. We find that for a wide range of UK infant products that the new regulations are being adhered to, with all samples surveyed, being under 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic. The prevalence of pure rice products had decreased in the UK, and there appears to be careful sourcing of the rice used in these products to ensure conformity with regulations. There has been an increased presence of mixed cereal products, with rice and maize as the main ingredient, appearing on the UK market, with varying rice contents for infant porridges, cakes and mueslis, with the latter being a relatively innovative product for infant foods. There was a highly significant correlation (P&amp;lt;0.0001) between rice content and inorganic arsenic concentration across all infant foods. When UK infant rice cakes, breakfast cereals and porridges were compare to their general, i.e. not labelled specifically for being for infant consumption, equivalent it was found that the adult foods generally exceeded the 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic standard for infant foods. Thus, infants should not be given rice products not specifically labelled as being for them if a lower inorganic arsenic diet is to be maintained.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Manus Carey, Emily Donaldson, Antonio J.

&lt;i&gt;Talaromyces&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Penicillium&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; is a thermally dimorphic fungus that can cause opportunistic systemic mycoses in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It has also been reported among patients with other causes of immunodeficiency, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer, organ transplanted patients receiving immunosuppressive drug and adult onset immunodeficiency syndromes. Recent studies indicate that the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and treatment strategies of talaromycosis (penicilliosis) marneffei are different between patients with and without HIV infection. Therefore early and accurate diagnosis of talaromycosis marneffei is crucial to the proper management and treatment. Since current diagnostic methods are currently inadequate, the aim of this study was to develop an immunochromatographic test (ICT) for the detection of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; yeast antigens in urine samples. The highly &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei-&lt;/i&gt;specific monoclonal antibody 4D1 (MAb 4D1) conjugated with gold colloid at pH 6.5 was used as signal generator. The nitrocellulose membrane was lined with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; cytoplasmic yeast antigen (TM CYA) to serve as the test line, and rabbit anti-mouse IgG was the control line. Subjecting the assembled test strip to urine samples containing &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; antigen produced a visible result within 20 minutes. The sensitivity limit of the assay was 3.125μg/ml of TM CYA.

A coproduction tests of quaternary (Q) phase(6CaO·4Al2O3·MgO·SiO2) -3CaO·3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cement clinker and an experimental study on the relationship between the mineral production capability and the physiochemical properties are conducted in a two-stage multiphase reaction test bed with Changguang coal. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analyses are performed on the coproduction clinker samples. The results demonstrate that, with the reduction in particle sizes of the coal powder and the additives and expanded screening level differences between them, both the proportion of Q phase and the mass of 3CaO·3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the clinker increase accordingly. When mixed coal powder particles are prepared through reducing particle sizes and expanding screening level differences between coal powder and additives, the additives CaO and MgO are more likely to be enclosed by coal powder to form globular polymerized particles. In addition, this preparation aids in polymerization and promotes even distribution of CaO, MgO and coal minerals, thus facilitating clinker mineral formation reactions of inorganic substances in the mixed coal powder. Target minerals, such as 2CaO·SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Q phase, are found in both industrial high-calcium limestone and low-calcium limestone coproduction clinker samples. A diffraction peak of free CaO is also evident in both samples. Compared with a coproduction clinker sample of high-calcium limestone, that of low-calcium limestone exhibits higher diffraction peaks for 2CaO·SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Q phase. With the current state of the art, it is not yet the optimum choice to substitute CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for CaO in Q-phase cement clinker coproduction. Before the technology matures and gains practical application, further study on the form and the mixing process of calcium-based additives for cement clinker coproduction will be required.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chao He, Chaochao Tian, Gang Li, Yahe Mei, Quanguo Zhang, Youzhou Jiao&lt;/p&gt;

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming increasingly integrated into oncological practice and clinical research. NGS methods have also provided evidence for clonal evolution of cancers during disease progression and treatment. The number of variants associated with response to specific therapeutic agents keeps increasing. However, the identification of novel driver mutations as opposed to passenger (phenotypically silent or clinically irrelevant) mutations remains a major challenge. We conducted targeted exome sequencing of advanced solid tumors from 44 pre-treated patients with solid tumors including breast, colorectal and lung carcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomas and others. We catalogued established driver mutations and putative new drivers as predicted by two distinct algorithms. The established drivers we detected were consistent with published observations. However, we also detected a significant number of mutations with driver potential never described before in each tumor type we studied. These putative drivers belong to key cell fate regulatory networks, including potentially druggable pathways. Should our observations be confirmed, they would support the hypothesis that new driver mutations are selected by treatment in clinically aggressive tumors, and indicate a need for longitudinal genomic testing of solid tumors to inform second line cancer treatment.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antonio Pannuti, Aleksandra Filipovic, Chindo Hicks, Elliot Lefkowitz, Travis Ptacek, Justin Stebbing, Lucio Miele&lt;/p&gt;

Here, we present an open source programming library, called GIVE that facilitates creation of personalized genome browsers without requiring a system administrator. By inserting HTML tags, one can add to a personal webpage interactive visualization of multiple types of genomics data, including genome annotation, &amp;quot;linear&amp;quot; quantitative data (wiggle), and genome interaction data.

Thus, these adhesins can attach to their target with exceptionally resilient mechanostability, virtually independent of peptide side chains.&lt;/p&gt;</description><keywords><item>Biochemistry</item></keywords></item><item><published>1522134599000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>New insights onto dissociation of state-selected O2+ ions investigated by double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence: The superimposed 32Πu and c4Σu− inner-valence states</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011046?af=R</originId><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f8907:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011046?af=R</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>16cbeeff</fingerprint><author><name>Xiaofeng Tang</name></author><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011046?af=R</link><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521442800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><unread>False</unread><title>GLUE: A flexible software system for virus sequence data [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/269274v3?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1623f991e58:28639c3:7d6c1c1c</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/19/269274</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/269274v3?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ee21f0b3</fingerprint><author><name>Singer, J.

In skeletal muscle the coordinated actions of two mechanically coupled Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels—the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1) and the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1)–underlie the molecular mechanism of rapid cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] increase leading to contraction. While both [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and contractile activity have been implicated in the regulation of myogenesis, less is known about potential specific roles of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 and RYR1 in skeletal muscle development. In this study, we analyzed the histology and the transcriptomic changes occurring at E14.5 –the end of primary myogenesis and around the onset of intrauterine limb movement, and at E18.5 –the end of secondary myogenesis, in WT, RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; murine limb skeletal muscle. At E14.5 the muscle histology of both mutants exhibited initial alterations, which became much more severe at E18.5. Immunohistological analysis also revealed higher levels of activated caspase-3 in the Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; muscles at E14.5, indicating an increase in apoptosis. With WT littermates as controls, microarray analyses identified 61 and 97 differentially regulated genes (DEGs) at E14.5, and 493 and 1047 DEGs at E18.5, in RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; samples, respectively. Gene enrichment analysis detected no overlap in the affected biological processes and pathways in the two mutants at E14.5, whereas at E18.5 there was a significant overlap of DEGs in both mutants, affecting predominantly processes linked to muscle contraction. Moreover, the E18.5 vs. E14.5 comparison revealed multiple genotype-specific DEGs involved in contraction, cell cycle and miRNA-mediated signaling in WT, neuronal and bone development in RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;, and lipid metabolism in Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; samples. Taken together, our study reveals discrete changes in the global transcriptome occurring in limb skeletal muscle from E14.5 to E18.5 in WT, RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice.

Cortical oscillations are thought to be involved in many cognitive functions and processes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate oscillations. One prominent but understudied mechanism is gap junction coupling. Gap junctions are ubiquitous in cortex between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, recent experiments indicate their strength can be modified in an activity-dependent manner, similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that activity-dependent gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate oscillations in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction plasticity in a recurrent cortical network based on recent experimental findings. We showed that gap junction plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism for oscillations by maintaining a tight balance between two network states: asynchronous irregular activity and synchronized oscillations. This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust communication between neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms: transient oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct functional role for gap junction plasticity in information transmission in cortex.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fShLgpxE30I&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Pernelle, Wilten Nicola, Claudia Clopath&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (KP) is after &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (EC) the most common gram-negative species causing invasive infections. Herein, we analyzed risk factors and prognosis in invasive infections caused by KP versus EC, in an area with low antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, we compared antimicrobial resistance and relative prevalence of KP and EC (KP/EC-ratio) in different European countries, using EARS-Net data. Adult patients admitted to Karolinska University Hospital 2006–2012 with invasive infection caused by KP (n = 599) were matched regarding sex and age with patients infected by EC. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Comorbidity was adjusted for with multivariable analysis. European data were retrieved from the EARS-Net database. No differences were observed in 7- and 30-day mortality between the groups. The 90-day mortality was significantly higher in the KP cohort (26% versus 17%, p&amp;lt;0.001), but not after adjusting for comorbidity. Malignancy was seen in 53% of the patients with KP versus 38% with EC, OR 1.86 (1.34–2.58). A significant increase in the rate of ESBL-production was observed in EC, but not in KP. The KP/EC-ratio remained stable. In contrast, European data showed increasing percentages of isolates non-susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins in EC and KP, and increasing KP/EC-ratio. Invasive infection caused by KP is a disease affecting patients with high comorbidity and associated with high 90-d mortality. The stable KP/EC-ratio and low occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in data from Karolinska University Hospital compared to aggregate data from 20 EARS-Net countries could be related to absence of clonal spread of multidrug-resistant KP.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by M.

&lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (KP) is after &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (EC) the most common gram-negative species causing invasive infections. Herein, we analyzed risk factors and prognosis in invasive infections caused by KP versus EC, in an area with low antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, we compared antimicrobial resistance and relative prevalence of KP and EC (KP/EC-ratio) in different European countries, using EARS-Net data. Adult patients admitted to Karolinska University Hospital 2006–2012 with invasive infection caused by KP (n = 599) were matched regarding sex and age with patients infected by EC. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Comorbidity was adjusted for with multivariable analysis. European data were retrieved from the EARS-Net database. No differences were observed in 7- and 30-day mortality between the groups. The 90-day mortality was significantly higher in the KP cohort (26% versus 17%, p&amp;lt;0.001), but not after adjusting for comorbidity. Malignancy was seen in 53% of the patients with KP versus 38% with EC, OR 1.86 (1.34–2.58). A significant increase in the rate of ESBL-production was observed in EC, but not in KP. The KP/EC-ratio remained stable. In contrast, European data showed increasing percentages of isolates non-susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins in EC and KP, and increasing KP/EC-ratio. Invasive infection caused by KP is a disease affecting patients with high comorbidity and associated with high 90-d mortality. The stable KP/EC-ratio and low occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in data from Karolinska University Hospital compared to aggregate data from 20 EARS-Net countries could be related to absence of clonal spread of multidrug-resistant KP.</content></content></item><item><published>1522116010699</published><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162652f22cb:6cdf0:76251cdd</id><fingerprint>7f7b850d</fingerprint><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25186?af=R</originId><unread>False</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25186?af=R</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1522116010699</crawled><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25186?af=R</link><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521567126000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/12/E2706/F1.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>181</height><width>440</width></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Structural basis for the role of serine-rich repeat proteins from Lactobacillus reuteri in gut microbe-host interactions [Biochemistry]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2706.short?rss=1</originId><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6f9:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2706</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2706.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>3d334dba</fingerprint><author><name>Saannya Sequeira, Devon Kavanaugh, Donald A.

Modulating immune responses to sepsis and trauma remain one of the most difficult challenges in modern medicine. Large burn injuries (LBI) are a severe form of trauma associated with sepsis, immune impairment, and mortality. Immune dysfunction after LBI is complex, involving both enhanced and impaired immune activation. The release of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), such as HMGB1, and cytokines (e.g. IL-1β) creates an environment of immune dysfunction often leading to end organ failure and death. Both HMGB1 and IL-1β have been found to play critical roles in sepsis and post-burn immune dysfunction. HMGB1 and IL-1β have been shown previously to form potent complexes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We recently identified the presence of HMGB1/IL-1β heterocomplexes in human tissue. We now find HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in human and mouse plasma, and identify a synergistic role of HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in post-burn immune dysfunction. In both humans and mice, we found that HMGB1 was enriched in plasma microvesicles (MVs) after LBI. HMGB1 was found form complexes with IL-1β. Using flow cytometry of mouse plasma MVs, we identified an increase in an HMGB1+/IL-1β+ MVs. Using co-IP, HMGB1 was found to bind the pro-form of IL-1β in mouse and human plasma. Pro-IL-1β, which is traditionally considered inactive, became active when complexed with HMGB1. Human THP-1 monocytes treated with HMGB1-pro-IL-1β complexes showed increased transcription of LBI associated cytokines IL-6 and IFNβ along with suppression of iNOS, mimicking findings associated with LBI. These findings identify that HMGB1/IL-1β complexes released after burn injuries can modulate immune responses, and microvesicles are identified as a novel reservoir for these immune mediators. These complexes might serve as novel immune targets for the treatment of systemic immune responses due to LBI or other causes of sepsis.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Leon G.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hospital inpatients often experience medical and psychiatric problems simultaneously. Although this implies a certain relationship between healthcare utilization and costs, this relationship has never been systematically reviewed.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective is to examine the extent to which medical-psychiatric comorbidities relate to health-economic outcomes in general and in different subgroups. If the relationship is significant, this would give additional reasons to facilitate the search for targeted and effective treatments for this complex population.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A systematic review in Embase, Medline, Psycinfo, Cochrane, Web of Science and Google Scholar was performed up to August 2016 and included cross-references from included studies. Only peer-reviewed empirical studies examining the impact of inpatient medical-psychiatric comorbidities on three health-economic outcomes (length of stay (LOS), medical costs and rehospitalizations) were included. Study design was not an exclusion criterion, there were no restrictions on publication dates and patients included had to be over 18 years. The examined populations consisted of inpatients with medical-psychiatric comorbidities and controls. The controls were inpatients without a comorbid medical or psychiatric disorder. Non-English studies were excluded.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From electronic literature databases, 3165 extracted articles were scrutinized on the basis of title and abstract. This resulted in a full-text review of 86 articles: 52 unique studies were included. The review showed that the presence of medical-psychiatric comorbidity was related to increased LOS, higher medical costs and more rehospitalizations. The meta-analysis revealed that patients with comorbid depression had an increased mean LOS of 4.38 days compared to patients without comorbidity (95% CI: 3.07 to 5.68, I2 = 31%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Medical-psychiatric comorbidity is related to increased LOS, medical costs and rehospitalization; this is also shown for specific subgroups. This study had some limitations; namely, that the studies were very heterogenetic and, in some cases, of poor quality in terms of risk of bias. Nevertheless, the findings remain valid and justify the search for targeted and effective interventions for this complex population.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Luc Jansen, Maarten van Schijndel, Jeroen van Waarde, Jan van Busschbach&lt;/p&gt;

Nevertheless, the findings remain valid and justify the search for targeted and effective interventions for this complex population.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522679416000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;“Beall’s List”, as a way to keep track of predatory publishers, has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/01/30/the-predatory-publishers-list-goes-dark&quot;&gt;officially offline&lt;/a&gt; for some time now. Jeffrey Beall himself has said that it was taken down under “intense pressure” from his employer (the University of Colorado at Denver), although his employer says no, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/18/librarians-list-predatory-journals-reportedly-removed-due-threats-and-politics&quot;&gt;not at all&lt;/a&gt;, this was his personal decision. (I know which side of that story I believe more). The businesses in this area are a touchy and litigious lot – well, at least in threatening to file lawsuits, anyway – and many legal departments would surely just rather not deal with all of the potential trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It now appears, though, that the list &lt;a href=&quot;https://beallslist.weebly.com/&quot;&gt;is back online&lt;/a&gt; in updated form, but is being &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02921-2&quot;&gt;maintained anonymously&lt;/a&gt;. One of the people behind it told &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; that they spend several hours a week dealing with inquiries and maintaining the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the journal titles aren’t already listed, the manager says they carry out an “in-depth analysis” of the publishers’ policies, checking them against a set of criteria originally laid out by Beall, and researching whether they are indexed on journal ‘whitelists’, such as the Directory of Open Access Journals or Journal Citation Reports. Journals or publishers deemed untrustworthy by the manager are included in an ‘update’ addendum on the blog. By March 2018, the new site had added 85 stand-alone journals and 27 publishers to Beall’s original lists of more than one thousand titles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for them. There are people who object to the idea that such journals are being called out anonymously, and there’s no doubt that the situation is open to potential abuse (although that doesn’t seem to be what’s happening so far). But what else to do when you’re barraged by threats if you do this work openly under your own name? Cabell’s is a company that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/07/25/cabells-new-predatory-journal-blacklist-review/&quot;&gt;taken on the challenge&lt;/a&gt;, with a subscription model blacklist (and whitelist), and it would be interesting to know what kind of flak they get from the hack publishers of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As that last link says, though, there can be some confusion (and has been on Cabell’s list and others) between low-quality journals and predatory ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So what are the problems? The most serious is that, as currently configured, Cabell’s Blacklist perpetuates the common problem of conflating low-quality journal publishing with deceptive or predatory publishing. In this case, the conflation happens because many of the blacklisting criteria Cabell’s applies are really quality criteria (“poor grammar and/or spelling,” “does not have a clearly stated peer review policy,” “no policy for digital preservation,” etc.) that can easily end up gathering fundamentally honest but less-competently-run journals into the same net as those journals that are actively trying to perpetrate a scam. Predatory and incompetent journals do often evince some of the same traits, but these traits don’t always indicate predatory intent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things overlap to a good degree, but not perfectly. Many of the predatory outfits, the we-have-three-hundred-journals-and-add-two-every-day folks, tend to be very sloppy and unprofessional quick-buck artists. But there are some rather slick ones, too, that at first glance don’t look that much different from actual journals. Meanwhile, there are actual journals, the smaller and/or newer ones, that can be rough around the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by an “actual journal”, then? There are perfectly good open-access journals, so we can’t say that the distinction is whether someone has to pay to read it. I’d say that the big distinction is some level of editorial control – and by that, I don’t only mean “Just a proportion of the papers make it in”, although that’s often the case. Even in more wide-open journals such as &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, papers are reviewed to make sure that they appear to be technically sound (they just don’t make calls on a paper’s impact or importance), and the same goes for many of the other respectable open-access titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings up another criterion: a real journal has some care for what it publishes. A fake or predatory journal, though, does not give a damn. Their reason to exist is to publish as many manuscripts as they can get and collect the payments for them, and if those manuscripts are faked, incoherent, or plagiarized? &lt;em&gt;Oh well.&lt;/em&gt; Did the payment clear? All right, then. Plenty of other journals and their publishers are trying to make money – and how – but their method of doing so runs through some variation of “Attain and preserve some level of respect from the readers and authors”. That’s as opposed to “Shear those sheep and keep the line moving”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to publish everything that comes in the door and maintain that respect, because the stuff that comes in that door is seriously contaminated with garbage. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/004641.html&quot;&gt;Here’s a famous post&lt;/a&gt; from the science-fiction publishing world, from editor Theresa Nielsen Hayden, called “Slushkiller”, about what comes in the transom where she works. About 70% of the submissions can be dismissed out of hand, usually within seconds, because the writing is &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; disjointed or incoherent. Another 25% of the stuff is written reasonably competently, but has a totally overused or borrowed plotline or has some other such flaw that would make it unsaleable. Now you’re down to the last five per cent or so, which is where the real editorial decisions actually start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific publishing is not as different as one might hope. I don’t know how many green-ink religious revelation manuscripts &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; get, but I’ll bet its a nonzero number. There are surely a lot of papers that come in written in such a disorganized manner that they cannot even be reviewed. Beyond that, there are many, many manuscripts that are readable and apparently not wrong, but are still not right for the journal they’ve been submitted to (often because of those impact and importance factors, which is where &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, etc. come in). &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, for example, has said that it rejects about 60% of submitted manuscripts without review, so although the proportion is a bit better than it was at Tor Books, it still means that a solid majority of all submissions don’t even clear the first hurdle of editorial attention. &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, for its part, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/15/plos-one-faced-decline-submissions-new-editor-speaks/&quot;&gt;said recently&lt;/a&gt; that it ends up rejecting about 50% of its submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast with a predatory journal could not be greater. They can, and do, publish whatever gibberish comes in, as long as the money is good, while all the time pretending to be what they are not. Editorial attention of any type is incompatible with their business model. That, to me, is the difference, and that is why these journals must be shunned.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>“Beall’s List”, as a way to keep track of predatory publishers, has been officially offline for some time now.

It makes sense – if you want things to react, getting all the partners dissolved in some medium where they can roam around and contact each other is surely the way to go, most of the time. But it’s also true that we don’t really have a good grasp of what’s happening in solution at the molecular level. Solvation shells, nanoscale aggregates and clusters, effects of interfacial regions: the idealized picture of things floating around is complicated by a lot of real-world effects, which can be very important. They’re particularly so when it comes to dissolution and its opposite, precipitation and crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the formation of microcrystals. I know that I had a mental picture of these that is probably incorrect. As I imagined it, all sorts of nucleation events happened in solution but the size of the resulting crystals was constrained (perhaps by amount of available solute, or by effects of stirring) so that they just didn’t grow very large. But in many systems, it appears that what happens first is a liquid-liquid phase separation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;sound familiar?&lt;/a&gt;), what’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinodal_decomposition&quot;&gt;spinodal decomposition&lt;/a&gt; into microscopic solute-rich and solute-poor droplets, and the solute-rich ones then crystallize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201711128&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; provides another example of liquid-phase weirdness. The authors are looking at a very well-known reaction, reduction of a metal salt to the elemental metal. That sentence hides a lot of complications: for example, what form does this metal arrive in? You can get a mirror deposit on the inside wall of the vessel (as with the famous old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollens%27_reagent&quot;&gt;Tollens reagent&lt;/a&gt; or the other more stable mirror-silvering mixtures), but more often you get some sort of fine black powder. Microscopic examination of that, though, reveals a huge range of particle sizes and morphologies depending on conditions, and it’s just those changes that can make a big difference in (for example) catalyst performance. Finely divided high-surface-area metals (palladium/platinum on carbon, Raney nickel, Rieke metals) are very important in synthetic chemistry, and their properties vary tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work provides an ingenious variation. The authors take an aqueous solution of the metal salt (silver nitrate in the first example), freeze it in liquid nitrogen, and then let this ice chunk slowly dissolve in a cold solution of the reducing agent (sodium borohydride). That gives, under the right conditions, essentially an atom-by-atom release of silver ions into the solution, and what you get out is atomically dispersed metal. By electron microscopy, the great bulk of the material is produced as what are apparently single silver atoms, not clusters, aggregates, etc. (there’s also further characterization by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_X-ray_absorption_fine_structure&quot;&gt;EXAFS&lt;/a&gt;). I’m surprised that it doesn’t form those on standing, but as I said before, there are a lot of things about the solution phase that my mental models don’t handle well. The authors believe (on the basis of modeling calculations) that the solvation shell around the single metal atoms is a barrier to forming such nanoparticles, and that the release of individual metal atoms is thus key to the whole process. Dimers of silver atoms and the like seem to be just fine in aqueous solution if they can form (or if they’re whittled down to that size); this synthesis just doesn’t let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper demonstrates the same sort of chemistry with a whole list of metals – platinum, palladium, cobalt, nickel, copper, iridium, gold and more. It certainly seems to be a general process, and the resulting atomically dispersed metals would, you’d have to imagine, be very active catalysts in further reactions. What’s more, this entire method would seem to have applications in many other reactions, too, where the slow release of one reactant into an excess of another is important. I’m actually kicking myself not to have thought of something like this – in hindsight it seems like a perfectly simple idea, but try coming up with these in the forward direction!&lt;/p&gt;

Conclusions: Using unfiltered real-world datasets, deep learning networks show an impressive ability to not only learn spatio-temporal HVF changes but also to generate predictions for future HVFs up to 5.5 years, given only a single HVF.</content></content></item><item><published>1522702800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195196</canonicalUrl><updated>1522702800000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195196</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7692b:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Lung density change after SABR: A comparative study between tri-Co-60 magnetic resonance-guided system and linear accelerator</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195196</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>2c2eb639</fingerprint><author><name>Eunji Kim</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195196</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eunji Kim, Hong-Gyun Wu, Jong Min Park, Jung-in Kim, Hak Jae Kim, Hyun-Cheol Kang&lt;/p&gt;
Radiation-induced lung damage is an important treatment-related toxicity after lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). After implementing a tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co magnetic-resonance image guided system, ViewRay&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, we compared the associated early radiological lung density changes to those associated with a linear accelerator (LINAC). Eight patients treated with the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system were matched 1:1 with patients treated with LINAC. Prescription doses were 52 Gy or 60 Gy in four fractions, and lung dose-volumetric parameters were calculated from each planning system. The first two follow-up computed tomography (CT) were co-registered with the planning CT through deformable registration software, and lung density was measured by isodose levels. Tumor size was matched between the two groups, but the planning target volume of LINAC was larger than that of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036). With regard to clinically relevant dose-volumetric parameters in the lungs, the ipsilateral lung mean dose, &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10Gy&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;20Gy&lt;/sub&gt; were significantly poorer in tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co plans compared to LINAC plans (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, 0.036, and 0.017, respectively). Increased lung density was not observed in the first follow-up scan compared to the planning scan. A significant change of lung density was shown in the second follow-up scan and there was no meaningful difference between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for all dose regions. In addition, no patient developed clinical radiation pneumonitis until the second follow-up scan. Therefore, there was no significant difference in the early radiological lung damage between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for lung SABR despite of the inferior plan quality of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system compared to that of LINAC.

Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) is a founding member of the conserved Puf domain class of RNA-binding translational regulators. Pum binds with high specificity, contacting eight nucleotides, one with each of the repeats in its RNA-binding domain. In general, Pum is thought to block translation in collaboration with Nanos (Nos), which exhibits no binding specificity in isolation but is recruited jointly to regulatory sequences containing a Pum binding site in the 3’-UTRs of target mRNAs. Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;hb&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described—repression of maternal &lt;i&gt;bicoid&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3’-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA or protein. Instead, we find that Pum and Nos control the accumulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in testes.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tammy H. Wharton, Krystle J.

Results: I describe an expectation-maximization algorithm that estimates genotype frequencies and errors along sequences to allow for accurate genotype calling from ancient sequences. The implementation of this method, called snpAD, performs well on high-coverage ancient data, as shown by simulations and by subsampling the data of a high-coverage Neandertal genome. Although estimates for low-coverage genomes are less accurate, I am able to derive approximate estimates of heterozygosity from several low-coverage Neandertals. These estimates show that low heterozygosity, compared to modern humans, was common among Neandertals.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: The study of ancient genomes can elucidate the evolutionary past.

Despite its public availability, a majority of this data remains hard to query to the research community due to a lack of efficient data representation and indexing solutions. One of the available techniques to represent read data is a condensed form as an assembly graph. Such a representation contains all sequence information but does not store contextual information and metadata. We present two new approaches for a compressed representation of a graph coloring: a lossless compression scheme based on a novel application of wavelet tries as well as a highly accurate lossy compression based on a set of Bloom filters. Both strategies retain a coloring with dynamically changing graph topology. We present construction and merge procedures for both methods and evaluate their performance on a wide range of different datasets. By dropping the requirement of a fully lossless compression and using the topological information of the underlying graph, we can reduce memory requirements by up to three orders of magnitude. Representing individual colors as independently stored modules, our approaches are fully dynamic and can be efficiently parallelized. These properties allow for an easy upscaling to the problem sizes common to the biomedical domain. We provide prototype implementations in C++, summaries of our experiments as well as links to all datasets publicly at https://github.com/ratschlab/graph_annotation.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Technological advancements in high-throughput DNA sequencing have led to an exponential growth of sequencing data being produced and stored as a byproduct of biomedical research.

Although several studies have demonstrated a potential correlation of dietary patterns with cognitive function, the relationship between tooth loss and dietary patterns and cognitive function have not been identified. In this cross-sectional study, we used a reduced rank regression (RRR) analysis, a technique used previously to observe dietary patterns based on the intakes of nutrients or levels of biomarkers associated with the condition of interest, to identify tooth loss-related dietary patterns and investigate the associations of such patterns with cognitive impairment in 334 community-dwelling Japanese subjects aged ≥ 60 years. According to Pearson correlation coefficients, the intakes of six nutrients (ash content, sodium, zinc, vitamin B1, α- and β-carotene) correlated significantly with the number of remaining teeth. Using RRR analysis, we extracted four dietary patterns in our subject population that explained 86.67% of the total variation in the intakes of these six nutrients. Particularly, dietary pattern 1 (DP1) accounted for 52.2% of the total variation. Food groups with factor loadings of ≥ 0.2 included pickled green leafy vegetables, lettuce/cabbage, green leaves vegetables, cabbage, carrots/squash; by contrast, rice had a factor loading of &amp;lt;−0.2. In a multivariate regression analysis, the adjusted odds ratios regarding the prevalence of cognitive impairment for the lowest, middle and highest tertiles of the DP1 score were 1.00 (reference), 1.224 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.611–2.453) and 0.427 (95% CI: 0.191–0.954), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that tooth loss-related dietary patterns are associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment. These results may motivate changes in dental treatment and the dietary behaviours and thereby lower the risk of cognitive impairment.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Ishimiya, Hiroyuki Nakamura, Yutaka Kobayashi, Moeko Noguchi-Shinohara, Chiemi Abe, Chiaki Dohmoto, Yoshihisa Ikeda, Kahori Tokuno, Kazuhiro Ooi, Masami Yokokawa, Kazuo Iwasa, Kiyonobu Komai, Shuichi Kawashiri, Masahito Yamada&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Heightened sexual risk in adolescence and young adulthood may be partially explained by deficits in executive functioning, the set of cognitive processes used to make reasoned decisions. However, the association between executive function and sexual risk is understudied among adolescent girls and young women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In a cohort of 853 young women age 18–25 in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa, we evaluated executive function with three non-verbal cognitive tests: I. a rule-finding test, II. a trail-making test, and III. a figure drawing test. Using log-binomial regression models, we estimated the association between lower executive function test scores and indicators of sexual risk (unprotected sex acts, concurrent partnerships, transactional sex, and recent HSV-2 infection).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In general, young women with lower executive function scores reported higher frequencies of sexual risk outcomes, though associations tended to be small with wide confidence intervals. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test I was associated with more unprotected sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.4 (1.0, 1.8)]. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test II was associated with more concurrent relationships and transactional sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.6 (1.1, 2.5) and 1.7 (1.3, 2.4), respectively], and testing in the lowest four quintiles of Test III was associated with more concurrent relationships [aPR (95% CI): 1.7 (1.0, 2.7)].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate an association between low executive function and sexual risk in South African young women.

In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3D) digitization technique for natural objects, such as insects and plants. The key idea is to combine X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photographs to obtain both complicated 3D shapes and surface textures of target specimens. We measure a specimen by using an X-ray CT device and a digital camera to obtain a CT volumetric image (volume) and multiple photographs. We then reconstruct a 3D model by segmenting the CT volume and generate a texture by projecting the photographs onto the model. To achieve this reconstruction, we introduce a technique for estimating a camera position for each photograph. We also present techniques for merging multiple textures generated from multiple photographs and recovering missing texture areas caused by occlusion. We illustrate the feasibility of our 3D digitization technique by digitizing 3D textured models of insects and flowers. The combination of X-ray CT and a digital camera makes it possible to successfully digitize specimens with complicated 3D structures accurately and allows us to browse both surface colors and internal structures.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takashi Ijiri, Hideki Todo, Akira Hirabayashi, Kenji Kohiyama, Yoshinori Dobashi&lt;/p&gt;

Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) has emerged as an important post-transcriptional mechanism that simultaneously alters expressions of thousands genes in cancers.

The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) software reconstructs dynamic regulatory networks by integrating static protein-DNA interaction data with time series gene expression data. In recent years, several additional types of high-throughput time series data have been profiled when studying biological processes including time series miRNA expression, proteomics, epigenomics and single cell RNA-Seq. Combining all available time series and static datasets in a unified model remains an important challenge and goal. To address this challenge we have developed a new version of DREM termed interactive DREM (iDREM). iDREM provides support for all data types mentioned above and combines them with existing interaction data to reconstruct networks that can lead to novel hypotheses on the function and timing of regulators. Users can interactively visualize and query the resulting model. We showcase the functionality of the new tool by applying it to microglia developmental data from multiple labs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/73xX3n_LGQE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jun Ding, James S.

Numerous peripheral tissues possess self-sustaining daily biologic rhythms that are regulated at the molecular level by clock genes such as &lt;i&gt;PER1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PER2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLOCK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and BMAL1&lt;/i&gt;. Physiological function of nasal mucosa exhibits rhythmic variability to a day-night environmental cycle. Nevertheless, little is known of the expression and distribution pattern of clock genes in nasal mucosa. The present study investigates the expression level and distribution pattern of &lt;i&gt;PER1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PER2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLOCK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and BMAL1&lt;/i&gt; genes in nasal mucosa of healthy controls, allergic rhinitis patients, and normal rats. In human and rat nasal mucosa, the levels of these genes are asymmetrically expressed in nasal mucosa derived from right and left cavities in normal controls, allergic patients, and rat. In human nasal mucosa, the expression levels of these genes were higher in the decongested side than the congested mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, these clock genes are expressed in a rhythmic circadian manner under the regular light/dark cycles. The expression levels of MUC5AC, a key mucin genes produced in superficial epithelium, are higher in decongested side than that congested side in human nasal mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, MUC5AC levels showed a circadian rhythm which was associated with different expression levels in nasal mucosa derived from the right and left nasal cavities. Taken together with these results, the present study shows that the clock genes such as &lt;i&gt;PER1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PER2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLOCK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and BMAL1&lt;/i&gt; are present in human and rat nasal mucosa, and suggest that these clock genes may control the pathophysiological function of nasal mucosa as circadian oscillators and affect the maintenance of the nasal cycle.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ha Kyun Kim, Hyun Jung Kim, Jae Hyung Kim, Tae Hoon Kim, Sang Hag Lee&lt;/p&gt;

We propose that external forces applied to single malignant cells restore cell-lrECM engagement and signaling lost in malignancy, allowing them to reestablish normal-like tissue architecture.</description><keywords><item>Cancer Biology</item><item>Cell Biology</item></keywords></item><item><published>1521752400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194183</canonicalUrl><updated>1521752400000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194183</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123910:9f3b30f2</id><title>Presence of stromal cells in a bioengineered tumor microenvironment alters glioblastoma migration and response to STAT3 inhibition</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194183</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>e450ba59</fingerprint><author><name>R.

Despite the increasingly recognized importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a regulator of tumor progression, only few &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models have been developed to systematically study the effects of TME on tumor behavior in a controlled manner. Here we developed a three-dimensional (3D) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model that recapitulates the physical and compositional characteristics of Glioblastoma (GBM) extracellular matrix (ECM) and incorporates brain stromal cells such as astrocytes and endothelial cell precursors. The model was used to evaluate the effect of TME components on migration and survival of various patient-derived GBM cell lines (GBM10, GBM43 and GBAM1) in the context of STAT3 inhibition. Migration analysis of GBM within the 3D &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model demonstrated that the presence of astrocytes significantly increases the migration of GBM, while presence of endothelial precursors has varied effects on the migration of different GBM cell lines. Given the role of the tumor microenvironment as a regulator of STAT3 activity, we tested the effect of the STAT3 inhibitor SH-4-54 on GBM migration and survival. SH-4-54 inhibited STAT3 activity and reduced 3D migration and survival of GBM43 but had no effect on GBM10. SH-4-54 treatment drastically reduced the viability of the stem-like line GBAM1 in liquid culture, but its effect lessened in presence of a 3D ECM and stromal cells. Our results highlight the interplay between the ECM and stromal cells in the microenvironment with the cancer cells and indicate that the impact of these relationships may differ for GBM cells of varying genetic and clinical histories.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by R.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive weakness of the skeletal and cardiac muscles. This X-linked disorder is caused by open reading frame disrupting mutations in the DMD gene, resulting in strong reduction or complete absence of dystrophin protein. In order to use dystrophin as a supportive or even surrogate biomarker in clinical studies on investigational drugs aiming at correcting the primary cause of the disease, the ability to reliably quantify dystrophin expression in muscle biopsies of DMD patients pre- and post-treatment is essential. Here we demonstrate the application of the ProteinSimple capillary immunoassay (Wes) method, a gel- and blot-free method requiring less sample, antibody and time to run than conventional Western blot assay. We optimized dystrophin quantification by Wes using 2 different antibodies and found it to be highly sensitive, reproducible and quantitative over a large dynamic range. Using a healthy control muscle sample as a reference and α-actinin as a protein loading/muscle content control, a panel of skeletal muscle samples consisting of 31 healthy controls, 25 Becker Muscle dystrophy (BMD) and 17 DMD samples was subjected to Wes analysis. In healthy controls dystrophin levels varied 3 to 5-fold between the highest and lowest muscle samples, with the reference sample representing the average of all 31 samples. In BMD muscle samples dystrophin levels ranged from 10% to 90%, with an average of 33% of the healthy muscle average, while for the DMD samples the average dystrophin level was 1.3%, ranging from 0.7% to 7% of the healthy muscle average. In conclusion, Wes is a suitable, efficient and reliable method for quantification of dystrophin expression as a biomarker in DMD clinical drug development.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chantal Beekman, Anneke A.

Control and synchronization of fractional-order chaotic systems have attracted wide attention due to their numerous potential applications. To get suitable control method and parameters for fractional-order chaotic systems, the stability analysis of time-varying fractional-order systems should be discussed in the first place. Therefore, this paper analyzes the stability of the time-varying fractional-order systems and presents a stability theorem for the system with the order 0&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;1. This theorem is a sufficient condition which can discriminate the stability of time-varying systems conveniently. Feedback controllers are designed for control and synchronization of the fractional-order Lü chaotic system.

Background &lt;p&gt;A number of studies have investigated cognitive impairment in paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) but deficits regarding executive functions have not been comprehensively assessed up to now. This study was meant to explore cognitive impairment in German paediatric MS patients with a focus on deficits in executive functions and relate these to clinical disease parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Forty paediatric MS patients, which presented at the German centre for MS in childhood and adolescence, were assessed for cognitive deficits applying a very comprehensive battery of cognitive tests including the Wechsler Intelligence scale and subtests of the D-KEFS for executive functions. The performance of MS patients was compared with a group of age and sex matched healthy controls using between-subjects ANOVAs. Paediatric MS patients performed worse in tests assessing verbal comprehension and fluency, processing speed, memory, calculation skills and other executive functions. Arranged by the cognitive domain, group differences were most pronounced regarding verbal comprehension and fluency for the WISC subtests Comprehension (p = 0.000), Vocabulary (p = 0.003) and Information (p = 0.005); regarding processing speed for the written SDMT (p = 0.001) and the WISC subtest Coding (p = 0.005); regarding memory for the VLMT training (p = 0.007) and the BASIC MLT pattern learning training (p = 0.009); regarding executive functions including working memory for the WISC subtest Arithmetics (p = 0.002), the D-KEFS Design Fluency (p = 0.003) and the Corsi block tapping backward task (p = 0.003). Fluid reasoning was largely intact. Relations of cognitive performance and clinical parameters were assessed in MS patients. Disease duration was associated with a reduced performance in tests belonging to the domains verbal comprehension and fluency (WISC Vocabulary: p = 0.034, WISC Information: p = 0.015) and fluid reasoning (WISC Picture Completion: p = 0.003) as well as the WISC Working Memory Index (p = 0.047). Patients with a disease onset between 11 and 14 years performed better in fluid reasoning (WISC matrix reasoning: p = 0.024) than patients with a disease onset at an age above 14. The number of relapses negatively influenced the visual spatial memory performance (BASIC MLT pattern learning training: p = 0.009).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The distribution of cognitive deficits in a representative group German of paediatric MS patients was similar to the pattern known from other European and North-American cohorts. Paediatric MS patients do have cognitive deficits in executive functions and key qualities necessary for successful school performance. Disease duration, age of onset and the number of relapses influence cognitive performance. Cognitive screenings should be implemented on a regular basis for paediatric MS patients, enabling early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eva Wuerfel, Almuth Weddige, York Hagmayer, Rebecca Jacob, Lisa Wedekind, Wiebke Stark, Jutta Gärtner&lt;/p&gt;

Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by a progressive loss of articular cartilage, subchondral bone sclerosis and synovial inflammation and is the most common chronic condition worldwide today. However, most treatments have focused on pain relief and OA symptoms. For these reasons, many ongoing studies are currently trying to develop efficient and successful therapies based on its pathology. Animal models that mimic the histopathology and symptoms of OA have a critical role in OA research and make it possible to investigate both secondary osteoarthritic changes due to a precedent event such as traumatic injury and naturally occurring changes for the development of therapeutics which can be tested in preclinical and clinical OA trials. We induced OA in various animal models including rats, rabbits and guinea pigs by chemical, surgical and naturally occurring methods. In particular, the Dunkin-Hartley guinea pig is very attractive as an OA animal model because OA slowly progresses which is similar to human primary OA. Thus, this animal model mimics the pathophysiological process and environment of human primary OA. Besides the spontaneous OA model, anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) with medial meniscectomy and bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) as well as a chemical technique using sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA) were used to induce OA. We found that ACLT in the rat model induced OA changes in the histology and micro-CT image compared to OVX. The osteoarthritic change significantly increased following ACLT surgery in the rabbit model. Furthermore, we identified that OA pathogenic changes occurred in a time-dependent manner in spontaneous Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs. The MIA injection model is a rapid and minimally invasive method for inducing OA in animal models, whereas the spontaneous OA model has a slow and gradual progression of OA similar to human primary OA. We observed that histological OA change was extraordinarily increased at 9 ½ months in the spontaneous OA model, and thus, the grade was similar with that of the MIA model. Therefore, this study reports on OA pathology using various animal models as well as the spontaneous results naturally occurring in an OA animal model which had developed cartilage lesions and progressive osteoarthritic changes.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Eun Kim, Da-hyun Song, Soo Hyun Kim, Youngmee Jung, Sang Jun Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an incurable and rare hereditary syndrome. In recent times, treatment with glucocorticoid analogues has been shown to improve the neurological symptoms that characterize this condition, but the molecular mechanism of action of these analogues remains unknown. Hence, the aim of this study was to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of action of glucocorticoid analogues in the treatment of A-T by investigating the role of Dexamethasone (Dexa) in A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines. We used 2DE and tandem MS to identify proteins that were influenced by the drug in A-T cells but not in healthy cells. Thirty-four proteins were defined out of a total of 746±63. Transcriptome analysis was performed by microarray and showed the differential expression of 599 A-T and 362 wild type (WT) genes and a healthy un-matching between protein abundance and the corresponding gene expression variation. The proteomic and transcriptomic profiles allowed the network pathway analysis to pinpoint the biological and molecular functions affected by Dexamethasone in Dexa-treated cells. The present integrated study provides evidence of the molecular mechanism of action of Dexamethasone in an A-T cellular model but also the broader effects of the drug in other tested cell lines.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michele Menotta, Sara Orazi, Anna Maria Gioacchini, Chiara Spapperi, Anastasia Ricci, Luciana Chessa, Mauro Magnani&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding determinants shaping infection risk of endangered wildlife is a major topic in conservation medicine. The proboscis monkey, &lt;i&gt;Nasalis larvatus&lt;/i&gt;, an endemic primate flagship species for conservation in Borneo, is endangered through habitat loss, but can still be found in riparian lowland and mangrove forests, and in some protected areas. To assess socioecological and anthropogenic influence on intestinal helminth infections in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;larvatus&lt;/i&gt;, 724 fecal samples of harem and bachelor groups, varying in size and the number of juveniles, were collected between June and October 2012 from two study sites in Malaysian Borneo: 634 samples were obtained from groups inhabiting the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS), 90 samples were collected from groups of the Labuk Bay Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary (LBPMS), where monkeys are fed on stationary feeding platforms. Parasite risk was quantified by intestinal helminth prevalence, host parasite species richness (PSR), and eggs per gram feces (epg). Generalized linear mixed effect models were applied to explore whether study site, group type, group size, the number of juveniles per group, and sampling month predict parasite risk. At the LBPMS, prevalence and epg of &lt;i&gt;Trichuris&lt;/i&gt; spp., strongylids, and &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp. but not &lt;i&gt;Ascaris&lt;/i&gt; spp., as well as host PSR were significantly elevated. Only for &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp., prevalence showed significant changes between months; at both sites, the beginning rainy season with increased precipitation was linked to higher prevalence, suggesting the external life cycle of &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp. to benefit from humidity. Higher prevalence, epgs, and PSR within the LBPMS suggest that anthropogenic factors shape host infection risk more than socioecological factors, most likely via higher re-infection rates and chronic stress. Noninvasive measurement of fecal parasite stages is an important tool for assessing transmission dynamics and infection risks for endangered tropical wildlife. Findings will contribute to healthcare management in nature and in anthropogenically managed environments.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Annette Klaus, Christina Strube, Kathrin Monika Röper, Ute Radespiel, Frank Schaarschmidt, Senthilvel Nathan, Benoit Goossens, Elke Zimmermann&lt;/p&gt;

Koalas (&lt;i&gt;Phascolarctos cinereus&lt;/i&gt;) are iconic Australian marsupials currently threatened by several processes, including infectious diseases and ecological disruption. Infection with &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia pecorum&lt;/i&gt;, is considered a key driver of population decline. The clinical sign of ‘wet bottom’, a staining of the rump associated with urinary incontinence, is often caused by chlamydial urinary tract infections. However, wet bottom has been recorded in koalas free of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting other causative agents in those individuals. We used 16S rRNA diversity profiling to investigate the microbiome of the urogenital tract of ten female koalas in order to identify potential causative agents of wet bottom, other than &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt;. Five urogenital samples were processed from koalas presenting with wet bottom and five were clinically normal. All koalas were negative for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; infection. We detected thirteen phyla across the ten samples, with &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; occurring at the highest relative abundance (77.6%). The order &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillales&lt;/i&gt;, within the &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, comprised 70.3% of the reads from all samples. After normalising reads using DESeq2 and testing for significant differences (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), there were 25 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) more commonly found in one group over the other. The families &lt;i&gt;Aerococcaceae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tissierellaceae&lt;/i&gt; both had four significantly differentially abundant OTUs. These four &lt;i&gt;Tissierellaceae&lt;/i&gt; OTUs were all significantly more abundant in koalas with wet bottom. This study provides the foundation for future investigations of causes of koala wet bottom, other than &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; infection. This is of clinical relevance as wet bottom is often assumed to be caused by &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; and treated accordingly. Our research highlights that other organisms may be causing wet bottom, and these potential aetiological agents need to be further investigated to fully address the problems this species faces.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alistair R.

The computational analysis of the raw short-read data is complicated by the shared functional domains in peptides, and the complex evolutionary origins of many peptides (including recombination and truncation), resulting in a given short read aligning equally well to many possible peptides.

Here we describe an iterative algorithmic approach to successfully map reads to their true origin peptides and introduce a software package FAMLI that implements this algorithm. We demonstrate that FAMLI is able to identify peptides from a wide variety of metagenomes with a consistent precision of about 0.8, and recall of about 0.6, while retaining O(n) runtimes. This compares favorably to alternative approaches, including de novo assembly (that results in superior precision, but much inferior recall and much larger computational resource needs as compared to FAMLI), or hybrid taxonomic-identification approaches (that results in less consistent performance for extremely novel communities, as compared to FAMLI). Addressing the problem of short reads aligning equally well to hundreds of more peptides than are truly present in a sample is a key challenge any successful short-read-metagenomics software must address. We present an effective approach to mitigate this problem and improve the accuracy of functional metagenomic analysis.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Short-read metagenomics use high-throughput sequencing to reveal the functional capability of microbial communities.

Detailed knowledge of how a rider’s seating style and riding on a circle influences the movement symmetry of the horse’s head and pelvis may aid rider and trainer in an early recognition of low grade lameness. Such knowledge is also important during both subjective and objective lameness evaluations in the ridden horse in a clinical setting. In this study, inertial sensors were used to assess how different rider seating styles may influence head and pelvic movement symmetry in horses trotting in a straight line and on the circle in both directions. A total of 26 horses were subjected to 15 different conditions at trot: three unridden conditions and 12 ridden conditions where the rider performed three different seating styles (rising trot, sitting trot and two point seat). Rising trot induced systematic changes in movement symmetry of the horses. The most prominent effect was decreased pelvic rise that occurred as the rider was actively rising up in the stirrups, thus creating a downward momentum counteracting the horses push off. This mimics a push off lameness in the hindlimb that is in stance when the rider sits down in the saddle during the rising trot. On the circle, the asymmetries induced by rising trot on the correct diagonal counteracted the circle induced asymmetries, rendering the horse more symmetrical. This finding offers an explanation to the equestrian tradition of rising on the ‘correct diagonal.’ In horses with small pre-existing movement asymmetries, the asymmetry induced by rising trot, as well as the circular track, attenuated or reduced the horse’s baseline asymmetry, depending on the sitting diagonal and direction on the circle. A push off hindlimb lameness would be expected to increase when the rider sits during the lame hindlimb stance whereas an impact hindlimb lameness would be expected to decrease. These findings suggest that the rising trot may be useful for identifying the type of lameness during subjective lameness assessment of hindlimb lameness. This theory needs to be studied further in clinically lame horses.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Persson-Sjodin, Elin Hernlund, Thilo Pfau, Pia Haubro Andersen, Marie Rhodin&lt;/p&gt;

The identification of a chronic health condition was based on special health care needs and presence of a doctor’s diagnosis out of 24 school-relevant diseases.

Overall school performance was available for 1462 children (51% boys). Of these, 52% suffered from a chronic health condition. Compared to children without a chronic health condition, children with special health care needs (15%) performed worse at school (adjusted mean difference: -0.95, 95% CI: [-1.55; -0.35], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). Children with a doctor’s diagnosis but without special health care needs (37%) did not perform worse at school.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The root cause behind the low-grade inflammatory state seen in insulin resistant (obesity and type 2 diabetes) states is unclear. Insulin resistant subjects have elevations in plasma free fatty acids (FFA), which are ligands for the pro-inflammatory toll-like receptor (TLR)4 pathway. We tested the hypothesis that an experimental elevation in plasma FFA (within physiological levels) in lean individuals would upregulate TLR4 and activate downstream pathways (e.g., MAPK) in circulating monocytes.&lt;/p&gt; Research design and methods &lt;p&gt;Twelve lean, normal glucose-tolerant subjects received a low dose (30 ml/h) 48 h lipid or saline infusion on two different occasions. Monocyte TLR4 protein level, MAPK phosphorylation, and expression of genes in the TLR pathway were determined before and after each infusion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The lipid infusion significantly increased monocyte TLR4 protein and phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK. Lipid-mediated increases in TLR4 and p38 phosphorylation directly correlated with reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity (M value). Lipid increased levels of multiple genes linked to inflammation, including several TLRs, CD180, MAP3K7, and CXCL10. Monocytes exposed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; to lipid infusion exhibited enhanced &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; basal and LPS-stimulated IL-1β secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In lean subjects, a small increase in plasma FFA (as seen in insulin resistant subjects) is sufficient to upregulate TLR4 and stimulate inflammatory pathways (MAPK) in monocytes. Moreover, lipids prime monocytes to endotoxin. We provide proof-of-concept data in humans indicating that the low-grade inflammatory state characteristic of obesity and type 2 diabetes could be caused (at least partially) by pro-inflammatory monocytes activated by excess lipids present in these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hanyu Liang, Helen Lum, Andrea Alvarez, Jose de Jesus Garduno-Garcia, Benjamin J.

The spatial architecture of signaling pathways and the interaction with cell size and morphology are complex, but little understood. With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology, it becomes crucial to understand intracellular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We suggest an estimate of average concentration for arbitrary cell shapes depending on the cell volume and cell surface area. The normalized variance, known from image analysis, is suggested as an alternative measure to quantify the deviation from the average concentration. A mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space is presented, providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. Quantification of signaling time scales reveals that signal propagation is faster at the membrane than at the nucleus, while this time difference decreases with the number of signaling components in the cytosol. Our investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades with feedback and asymmetric cell shapes. We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wolfgang Giese, Gregor Milicic, Andreas Schröder, Edda Klipp&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Many mathematical models have investigated the population-level impact of expanding antiretroviral therapy (ART), using different assumptions about HIV disease progression on ART and among ART dropouts. We evaluated the influence of these assumptions on model projections of the number of infections and deaths prevented by expanded ART.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A new dynamic model of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) was developed, which incorporated each of four alternative assumptions about disease progression used in previous models: (A) ART slows disease progression; (B) ART halts disease progression; (C) ART reverses disease progression by increasing CD4 count; (D) ART reverses disease progression, but disease progresses rapidly once treatment is stopped. The model was independently calibrated to HIV prevalence and ART coverage data from the United States under each progression assumption in turn. New HIV infections and HIV-related deaths averted over 10 years were compared for fixed ART coverage increases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Little absolute difference (&amp;lt;7 percentage points (pp)) in HIV infections averted over 10 years was seen between progression assumptions for the same increases in ART coverage (varied between 33% and 90%) if ART dropouts reinitiated ART at the same rate as ART-naïve MSM. Larger differences in the predicted fraction of HIV-related deaths averted were observed (up to 15pp). However, if ART dropouts could only reinitiate ART at CD4&amp;lt;200 cells/μl, assumption C predicted substantially larger fractions of HIV infections and deaths averted than other assumptions (up to 20pp and 37pp larger, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Different disease progression assumptions on and post-ART interruption did not affect the fraction of HIV infections averted with expanded ART, unless ART dropouts only re-initiated ART at low CD4 counts.

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Bouhaddou, Anne Marie Barrette, Alan D.

Diverse plant pathogens export effector proteins to reprogram host cells. One of the most challenging goals in the molecular plant-microbe field is to functionally characterize the complex repertoires of effectors secreted by these pathogens. For bacterial pathogens, the predominant class of effectors is delivered to host cells by Type III secretion. For oomycetes, the predominant class of effectors is defined by a signal peptide that mediates secretion from the oomycete and a conserved RxLR motif. Downy mildew pathogens and &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/i&gt; species maintain hundreds of candidate RxLR effector genes in their genomes. Although no primary sequence similarity is evident between bacterial Type III effectors (T3Es) and oomycete RXLR effectors, some bacterial and oomycete effectors have convergently evolved to target the same host proteins. Such effectors might have evolved domains that are functionally similar but sequence-unrelated. We reasoned that alignment-free bioinformatics approaches could be useful to identify structural similarities between bacterial and oomycete effectors. To test this approach, we used partial least squares regression, alignment-free bioinformatics methods to identify effector proteins from the genome of the oomycete &lt;i&gt;Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis&lt;/i&gt; that are similar to the well-studied AvrE1 effector from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. This approach identified five RxLR proteins with putative structural similarity to AvrE1. We focused on one, HaRxL23, because it is an experimentally validated effector and it is conserved between distantly related oomycetes. Several experiments indicate that HaRxL23 is functionally similar to AvrE1, including the ability to partially rescue an AvrE1 loss-of-function mutant. This study provides an example of how an alignment-free bioinformatics approach can identify functionally similar effector proteins in the absence of primary sequence similarity. This approach could be useful to identify effectors that have convergently evolved regardless of whether the shared host target is known.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Devdutta Deb, David Mackey, Stephen O.

We also apply our method to real data, where we show that the use of our method results in the retention of distinct cell types that would otherwise have been discarded.</content></content></item><item><published>1522738800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23357-8/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23357_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>367</height><width>685</width></visual><unread>True</unread><title>A Critical Domain of Ebolavirus Envelope Glycoprotein Determines Glycoform and Infectivity</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23357-8</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1628acdc610:9385a99:9f3b30f2</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23357-8</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/zj4ZakhiibY/s41598-018-23357-8</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>c3ed41e9</fingerprint><author><name>Haruhiko Fujihira</name></author><crawled>1522747164176</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23357-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Critical Domain of Ebolavirus Envelope Glycoprotein Determines Glycoform and Infectivity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Critical Domain of Ebolavirus Envelope Glycoprotein Determines Glycoform and Infectivity, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23357-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23357-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A Critical Domain of Ebolavirus Envelope Glycoprotein Determines Glycoform and Infectivity&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/zj4ZakhiibY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Critical Domain of Ebolavirus Envelope Glycoprotein Determines Glycoform and Infectivity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Critical Domain of Ebolavirus Envelope Glycoprotein Determines Glycoform and Infectivity, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23357-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23357-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A Critical Domain of Ebolavirus Envelope Glycoprotein Determines Glycoform and Infectivity&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/zj4ZakhiibY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522134000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>dtangle: accurate and fast cell-type deconvolution [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/290262v1?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1626acbd761:660c23e:7d6c1c1c</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/290262</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/290262v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>384b7295</fingerprint><author><name>Hunt, G.

To aid understanding cell type composition, methods of estimating (deconvolving) cell type proportions from gene expression data have been developed. Results: We propose dtangle, a new cell-type deconvolution method. dtangle works on a range of DNA microarray and bulk RNA-seq platforms.

Experimental recordings in hippocampal slices indicate that astrocytic dysfunction may cause neuronal hyper-excitation or seizures. Considering that astrocytes play important roles in mediating local uptake and spatial buffering of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the extracellular space of the cortical circuit, we constructed a novel model of an astrocyte-neuron network module consisting of a single compartment neuron and 4 surrounding connected astrocytes and including extracellular potassium dynamics. Next, we developed a new model function for the astrocyte gap junctions, connecting two astrocyte-neuron network modules. The function form and parameters of the gap junction were based on nonlinear regression fitting of a set of experimental data published in previous studies. Moreover, we have created numerical simulations using the above single astrocyte-neuron network module and the coupled astrocyte-neuron network modules. Our model validates previous experimental observations that both Kir4.1 channels and gap junctions play important roles in regulating the concentration of extracellular potassium. In addition, we also observe that changes in Kir4.1 channel conductance and gap junction strength induce spontaneous epileptic activity in the absence of external stimuli.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fOtr0tevqZs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mengmeng Du, Jiajia Li, Liang Chen, Yuguo Yu, Ying Wu&lt;/p&gt;

Worldwide, 500,000 cases of head and neck cancer (HNC) are reported each year and the primary treatment for HNC is radiotherapy. Although the goal of radiotherapy is to target the tumor, secondary exposure occurs in surrounding normal tissues, such as the salivary glands. As a result, despite successful treatment of the cancer, patients are left with long-term side effects due to direct damage to the salivary glands. The effect is chronic and currently there is no treatment. Stem cells are an attractive therapeutic option for treatment of radiation-induced glandular dysfunction because of the potential to regenerate damaged cell populations and restore salivary gland function. However, limited knowledge about the endogenous stem cell population post irradiation hinders the development for stem cell-based therapies. In this study, an ex vivo sphere formation cell culture system was utilized to assess the self-renewal capacity of cells derived from parotid salivary glands at a chronic time point following radiation. Salivary glands from irradiated mice generate significantly fewer salispheres, but can be stimulated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to generate an equivalent number of salispheres as unirradiated salivary glands. Interestingly, the number and size of salispheres formed is dependent on the concentration of FBS supplemented into the media. Salispheres derived from irradiated glands and cultured in FBS media were found to contain cells that proliferate and express progenitor and acinar cell markers such as Keratin 5, Keratin 14, Aquaporin 5, and NKCC1. Utilization of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) injections following radiation treatment restores salivary gland function and improves salisphere generation. These findings indicate that stimulation of these cellular populations may provide a promising avenue for the development of cell-based therapies for radiation-induced salivary gland damage.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vicky T.

With the exploitation of offshore oil and gas gradually moving to deep water, higher temperature differences and pressure differences are applied to the pipeline system, making the global buckling of the pipeline more serious. For unburied deep-water pipelines, the lateral buckling is the major buckling form. The initial imperfections widely exist in the pipeline system due to manufacture defects or the influence of uneven seabed, and the distribution and geometry features of initial imperfections are random. They can be divided into two kinds based on shape: single-arch imperfections and double-arch imperfections. This paper analyzed the global buckling process of a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections by using a numerical simulation method and revealed how the ratio of the initial imperfection’s space length to the imperfection’s wavelength and the combination of imperfections affects the buckling process. The results show that a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections may suffer the superposition of global buckling. The growth ratios of buckling displacement, axial force and bending moment in the superposition zone are several times larger than no buckling superposition pipeline. The ratio of the initial imperfection’s space length to the imperfection’s wavelength decides whether a pipeline suffers buckling superposition. The potential failure point of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is as same as the no buckling superposition pipeline, but the failure risk of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is much higher. The shape and direction of two nearby imperfections also affects the failure risk of pipeline exhibiting global buckling superposition. The failure risk of pipeline with two double-arch imperfections is higher than pipeline with two single-arch imperfections.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wenbin Liu, Aimin Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be overcome by electrical stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) via a cochlear implant (CI). Restricted CI performance results from the spatial gap between the SGNs and the electrode, but the efficacy of CI is also limited by the degeneration of SGNs as one consequence of SHNL. In the healthy cochlea, the survival of SGNs is assured by endogenous neurotrophic support. Several applications of exogenous neurotrophic supply have been shown to reduce SGN degeneration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In the present study, nanoporous silica nanoparticles (NPSNPs), with an approximate diameter of &amp;lt;100 nm, were loaded with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to test their efficacy as long-term delivery system for neurotrophins. The neurotrophic factor was released constantly from the NPSNPs over a release period of 80 days when the surface of the nanoparticles had been modified with amino groups. Cell culture investigations with NIH3T3 fibroblasts attest a good general cytocompatibility of the NPSNPs. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments with SGNs indicate a significantly higher survival rate of SGNs in cell cultures that contained BDNF-loaded nanoparticles compared to the control culture with unloaded NPSNPs (p&amp;lt;0.001). Importantly, also the amounts of BDNF released up to a time period of 39 days increased the survival rate of SGNs. Thus, NPSNPs carrying BDNF are suitable for the treatment of inner ear disease and for the protection and the support of SGNs. Their nanoscale nature and the fact that a direct contact of the nanoparticles and the SGNs is not necessary for neuroprotective effects, should allow for the facile preparation of nanocomposites, e.g., with biocompatible polymers, to install coatings on implants for the realization of implant-based growth factor delivery systems.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nadeschda Schmidt, Jennifer Schulze, Dawid P.
