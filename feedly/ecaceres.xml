However, their utility is hampered by the lack of fast, inexpensive, and accurate methods for quantifying bacterial community composition. For instance, while next-generation amplicon sequencing can be very accurate, high costs (&gt;$30 per sample) and turnaround times (&gt;1 month) limit the nature and pace of experiments. Here, we introduce a new approach for quantifying composition in synthetic bacterial communities based on Sanger sequencing. First, for a given community, we PCR-amplify a universal marker gene (here, the 16S rRNA gene), which yields a mixture of amplicons. Second, we sequence this amplicon mixture in a single Sanger sequencing reaction, which produces a &amp;quot;mixed&amp;quot; electropherogram with contributions from each community member. We also sequence each community member&apos;s marker gene individually to generate &amp;quot;individual&amp;quot; electropherograms. Third, we fit the mixed electropherogram as a linear combination of time-warped individual electropherograms, thereby allowing us to estimate the fractional amplicon abundance of each strain within the community. Importantly, our approach accounts for retention-time variability in electrophoretic signals, which is crucial for accurate compositional estimates. Using synthetic communities of marine bacterial isolates, we show that this approach yields accurate and reproducible abundance estimates for two-, four-, and seven-strain bacterial communities. Furthermore, this approach can provide results within one day and costs ~$5 USD per sample. We envision this approach will enable new insights in microbial ecology by increasing the number of samples that can be analyzed and enabling faster iteration between experiments and theory.

The behaviour of most animals has evolved in a communication network environment, in which signals produced by senders are perceived by many intended and unintended receivers. In this study, we tested whether the corncrake (&lt;i&gt;Crex crex&lt;/i&gt;), a nocturnal rail species with innate (non-learned) calls, is able to eavesdrop on the interactions of conspecific males and how this eavesdropping affects subsequent responses by the eavesdropper to territorial intrusion. In the first step, simulated aggressive or neutral interactions between male dyads were presented to a focal male. In the second step, the calls of winning, losing or neutral males from the first step were played within the territory of the focal male. We measured behavioural and vocal responses of focal males. We found that corncrakes eavesdropped on signal exchange between rivals. Males often began responding to distant aggressive interactions during the eavesdropping phase, and they responded strongly during the intrusion phase of the experiments. The response was significantly weaker to playback of males from neutral interactions than to those involved in aggressive interactions, and we found no differences between the responses to Winners and Losers entering a focal male territory.</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><published>1526677200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A nocturnal rail with a simple territorial call eavesdrops on interactions between rivals</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197368</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lucyna Ewa Wojas, Paweł Wojciech Podkowa, Tomasz Stanisław Osiejuk&lt;/p&gt;

Current interventions focus on the restoration of blood flow to limit neuronal death, but these treatments have a therapeutic window of only a few hours and do not address post-stroke cerebral inflammation. The complement system, a component of the innate immune system, is activated by natural immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies that recognize neoepitopes expressed in the brain after ischemic stroke. We took advantage of this recognition system to inhibit complement activation locally in the ischemic area in mice. A single chain antibody recognizing a post-ischemic neoepitope linked to a complement inhibitor (termed B4Crry) was administered systemically as a single dose after stroke and shown to specifically target the ischemic hemisphere and improve long-term motor and cognitive recovery. We show that complement opsonins guide microglial phagocytosis of stressed but salvageable neurons, and that by locally and transiently inhibiting complement deposition, B4Crry prevented phagocytosis of penumbral neurons and inhibited pathologic complement and microglial activation that otherwise persisted for several weeks after stroke. B4Crry was protective in adult, aged, male and female mice and had a therapeutic window of at least 24 hours after stroke. Furthermore, the epitope recognized by B4Crry in mice is overexpressed in the ischemic penumbra of acute stroke patients, but not in the contralateral tissue, highlighting the translational potential of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526494115833</crawled><published>1526493034000</published><unread>True</unread><title>[Research Articles] Targeted complement inhibition salvages stressed neurons and inhibits neuroinflammation after stroke in mice</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/441/eaao6459?rss=1</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke results from the interruption of blood flow to the brain resulting in long-term motor and cognitive neurological deficits, and it is a leading cause of death and disability.

We show that complement opsonins guide microglial phagocytosis of stressed but salvageable neurons, and that by locally and transiently inhibiting complement deposition, B4Crry prevented phagocytosis of penumbral neurons and inhibited pathologic complement and microglial activation that otherwise persisted for several weeks after stroke. B4Crry was protective in adult, aged, male and female mice and had a therapeutic window of at least 24 hours after stroke. Furthermore, the epitope recognized by B4Crry in mice is overexpressed in the ischemic penumbra of acute stroke patients, but not in the contralateral tissue, highlighting the translational potential of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/441/eaao6459.full</canonicalUrl><origin><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/441/eaao6459?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>13</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_1633b238226:2a389d7:5785ab88</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0145-x</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0145-x</link><author><name>Aleksandra Deczkowska</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microglial immune checkpoint mechanisms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microglial immune checkpoint mechanisms, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0145-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0145-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Microglial immune checkpoint mechanisms are signaling pathways that limit immune responsiveness and promote homeostatic activities of micrroglia throughout life, but can interfere with repair mechanisms in disease.</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525705572902</crawled><published>1525676400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Microglial immune checkpoint mechanisms</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0145-x</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>59519687</fingerprint><origin><title>Nature Neuroscience</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microglial immune checkpoint mechanisms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microglial immune checkpoint mechanisms, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0145-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0145-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Microglial immune checkpoint mechanisms are signaling pathways that limit immune responsiveness and promote homeostatic activities of micrroglia throughout life, but can interfere with repair mechanisms in disease.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00221/20180502/images/medium/cb-2018-00221c_0006.gif</url><height>366</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><id>ofNPcmQ46PpGzt1nO49W9STAvkUsM7jssLxNXMp09ME=_16322af19ae:59a1b8:d27a8ff7</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00221</originId><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00221</link><author><name>Tawatchai Thongkongkaew, Wei Ding, Evgeni Bratovanov, Emilia Oueis, Mari´a Garci´a-Altares, Nestor Zaburannyi, Kirsten Harmrolfs, Youming Zhang, Kirstin Scherlach, Rolf Müller, Christian Hertweck</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00221/20180502/images/medium/cb-2018-00221c_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00221&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

While previous work has shown that the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification is a useful, though subjective, feature for predicting surgical outcomes, obtaining this classification requires a clinician to review the patient&apos;s medical records. Our goal here is to create an improved risk score using electronic medical records and demonstrate its utility in predicting in-hospital mortality without requiring clinician-derived ASA scores. Methods: Data from 49,513 surgical patients were used to train logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted tree classifiers for predicting in-hospital mortality. The features used are readily available before surgery from EMR databases. A gradient boosted tree regression model was trained to impute the ASA Physical Status Classification, and this new, imputed score was included as an additional feature to preoperatively predict in-hospital post-surgical mortality. The preoperative risk prediction was then used as an input feature to a deep neural network (DNN), along with intraoperative features, to predict postoperative in-hospital mortality risk. Performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: We found that the random forest classifier (AUC 0.921, 95%CI 0.908-0.934) outperforms logistic regression (AUC 0.871, 95%CI 0.841-0.900) and gradient boosted trees (AUC 0.897, 95%CI 0.881-0.912) in predicting in-hospital post-surgical mortality. Using logistic regression, the ASA Physical Status Classification score alone had an AUC of 0.865 (95%CI 0.848-0.882). Adding preoperative features to the ASA Physical Status Classification improved the random forest AUC to 0.929 (95%CI 0.915-0.943). Using only automatically obtained preoperative features with no clinician intervention, we found that the random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.921 (95%CI 0.908-0.934). Integrating the preoperative risk prediction into the DNN for postoperative risk prediction results in an AUC of 0.924 (95%CI 0.905-0.941), and with both a preoperative and postoperative risk score for each patient, we were able to show that the mortality risk changes over time. Conclusions: Features easily extracted from EMR data can be used to preoperatively predict the risk of in-hospital post-surgical mortality in a fully automated fashion, with accuracy comparable to models trained on features that require clinical expertise. This preoperative risk score can then be compared to the postoperative risk score to show that the risk changes, and therefore should be monitored longitudinally over time.</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527274777449</crawled><published>1527231600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Preoperative predictions of in-hospital mortality using electronic medical record data [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329813v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><description>Background: Predicting preoperative in-hospital mortality using readily-available electronic medical record (EMR) data can aid clinicians in accurately and rapidly determining surgical risk.

Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (&lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been widely related to neuropsychiatry disorders. The localization of ANKK1 in neural progenitors and its correlation with the cell cycle has suggested its participation in development. However, ANKK1 functions still need to be identified. Here, we have further characterized the ANKK1 localization &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, by using immunolabeling, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in the myogenic lineage. Histologic investigations in mice and humans revealed that ANKK1 is expressed in precursors of embryonic and adult muscles. In mice embryos, ANKK1 was found in migrating myotubes where it shows a polarized cytoplasmic distribution, while proliferative myoblasts and satellite cells show different isoforms in their nuclei and cytoplasm. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of ANKK1 protein isoforms along the myogenic progression showed the decline of nuclear ANKK1-kinase until its total exclusion in myotubes. In adult mice, ANKK1 was expressed exclusively in the Fast-Twitch muscles fibers subtype. The induction of glycolytic metabolism in C2C12 cells with high glucose concentration or treatment with berberine caused a significant increase in the &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Similarly, C2C12 cells under hypoxic conditions caused the increase of nuclear ANKK1. These results altogether show a relationship between &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation and the metabolism of muscles during development and in adulthood. Finally, we found ANKK1 expression in regenerative fibers of muscles from dystrophic patients. Future studies in ANKK1 biology and the pathological response of muscles will reveal whether this protein is a novel muscle disease biomarker.</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><published>1526331600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>ANKK1 is found in myogenic precursors and muscle fibers subtypes with glycolytic metabolism</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197254</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Estrella Rubio-Solsona, Salvador Martí, Juan J.

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525975049460</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0tROk9h9FSA/article</href></item></alternate><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Nonlinear decoding of a complex movie from the mammalian retina</title><recrawled>1525984928890</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vicente Botella-Soler, Stéphane Deny, Georg Martius, Olivier Marre, Gašper Tkačik&lt;/p&gt;

Cannibalism is a commonly observed phenomenon in arthropod species having relevant consequences for population dynamics and individual fitness. It is a context-dependent behaviour and an understanding of the factors affecting cannibalism rate is crucial to highlight its ecological relevance. In mosquitoes, cannibalism between larval stages has been widely documented, and the role of density, food availability and length of contact between individuals also ascertained. However, although mosquitoes can develop in temporary water habitats with very heterogeneous topologies, the role of the site shape where cannibals and victims co-occur has been instead overlooked. In this paper, we investigated this issue by using a simulation approach and laboratory cannibalism experiments between old (third- and fourth-instars) and young (first-instar) larvae of the tiger mosquito &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. Three virtual spaces with different shapes were simulated and the number of larval encounters was estimated in each one to assess whether the spatial shape affected the number of encounters between cannibal and victims. Then, experimental trials in containers with similar shapes to those used in the simulations were performed, and the cannibalism rate was estimated at 24 and 48h. Our results showed that the spatial shape plays a role on cannibalism interactions, affecting the number of encounters between individuals. Indeed, in the experimental trials performed, we observed the highest cannibalism rate in the container with the highest number of encounters predicted by the simulations. Interestingly, we found also that spatial shape can affect cannibalism not only by affecting the number of encounters, but also the number of encounters “favorable” for cannibalistic events. Temporary waters are inhabited by several species other than mosquitoes. Our results, showing an influence of the spatial shape on cannibalism in &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; larvae, add a new critical factor to those affecting ecological interactions in these habitats.</content></content><updated>1527627600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><published>1527627600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Cannibalism in temporary waters: Simulations and laboratory experiments revealed the role of spatial shape in the mosquito &amp;lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198194</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Valentina Mastrantonio, Graziano Crasta, Arianna Puggioli, Romeo Bellini, Sandra Urbanelli, Daniele Porretta&lt;/p&gt;

Three virtual spaces with different shapes were simulated and the number of larval encounters was estimated in each one to assess whether the spatial shape affected the number of encounters between cannibal and victims. Then, experimental trials in containers with similar shapes to those used in the simulations were performed, and the cannibalism rate was estimated at 24 and 48h. Our results showed that the spatial shape plays a role on cannibalism interactions, affecting the number of encounters between individuals. Indeed, in the experimental trials performed, we observed the highest cannibalism rate in the container with the highest number of encounters predicted by the simulations. Interestingly, we found also that spatial shape can affect cannibalism not only by affecting the number of encounters, but also the number of encounters “favorable” for cannibalistic events. Temporary waters are inhabited by several species other than mosquitoes. Our results, showing an influence of the spatial shape on cannibalism in &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; larvae, add a new critical factor to those affecting ecological interactions in these habitats.</description><fingerprint>1c213f10</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198194</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0e9:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</canonicalUrl><author><name>Efthymia Giosa</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Efthymia Giosa, Christos Mammides, Savvas Zotos&lt;/p&gt;
The degradation of natural wetlands has significant effects on the ecosystem services they provide and the biodiversity they sustain. Under certain conditions, these negative effects can be mitigated by the presence of artificial wetlands. However, the conservation value of artificial wetlands needs to be explored further. In addition, it is unclear how certain anthropogenic variables, such as road networks and hunting reserves (i.e., areas where hunting of birds is prohibited) affect biodiversity in both artificial and natural wetlands. Here, we use data from thirteen artificial and six natural wetlands in Cyprus, to assess their similarities in bird species diversity and composition, and to quantify the relationship between species diversity and the density of road networks, hunting reserves, wetland size, and wetland depth. We found that while on average natural wetlands have more species and support higher abundances, certain artificial wetlands have the potential to support similarly diverse communities. Overall, regardless of the type, larger wetlands, with shallower waters tend to be more biodiverse. The same is true for wetlands surrounded by a higher percentage of hunting reserves and a lower density of road networks, albeit the effect of road networks was weaker. We conclude, from our results, that although the conservation value of natural wetlands is higher, artificial wetlands have the potential to play a complimentary role in the conservation of bird communities, assuming those wetlands have the right characteristics (e.g., in terms of size and depth) and assuming that the disturbances resulting from high-impact human-activities (e.g., hunting) are minimized.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The importance of artificial wetlands for birds: A case study from Cyprus</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Efthymia Giosa, Christos Mammides, Savvas Zotos&lt;/p&gt;

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls.

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape. We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</description><fingerprint>b9423df6</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16349216b81:11b4d49:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25254-6</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25254-6</link><author><name>Yan Li</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Protein corona of airborne nanoscale PM2.5 induces aberrant proliferation of human lung fibroblasts based on a 3D organotypic culture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Protein corona of airborne nanoscale PM2.5 induces aberrant proliferation of human lung fibroblasts based on a 3D organotypic culture, Published online: 10 May 2018;

A new set of efficient solvent-free dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) force fields was developed for phospholipids and peptides. To enhance transferability, this model maps around four heavy atoms and their connected hydrogen atoms into a coarse-grained elementary bead based on functional group. The effective hybrid potential between any pair of beads is composed of a short-range repulsive soft-core potential that directly adopts the form of an explicit-solvent DPD model and a long-range attractive hydrophobic potential. The parameters of the attractive potentials for lipid molecules were obtained by fitting the explicit-solvent DPD simulation of one bead of any type in a water box, then finely tuning it until the bilayer membrane properties obtained in the explicit-solvent model were matched. These parameters were further extended to amino acids according to bead type. The structural and elastic properties of bilayer membranes, free energy profiles for a lipid flip-flop and amino acid analogues translocating across the membrane, and membrane pore formation induced by antimicrobial peptides obtained from this solvent-free DPD force field considerably agreed with the explicit-solvent DPD results. Importantly, the efficiency of this method is guaranteed to accelerate the assembly of vesicles composed of several thousand lipids by up to 50-fold, rendering the experimental liposome dynamics as well as membrane-peptide interactions feasible at accessible computational expense.</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Implicit-solvent dissipative particle dynamics force field based on a four-to-one coarse-grained mapping scheme</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198049</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mingwei Wan, Lianghui Gao, Weihai Fang&lt;/p&gt;

This optimization exploits the potential of cryofixation, allowing quality ultrastructural preservation for diverse EM applications.</description><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35524</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559150:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197117</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197117</canonicalUrl><author><name>Page Axley</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Page Axley, Sandhya Mudumbi, Shabnam Sarker, Yong-Fang Kuo, Ashwani Singal&lt;/p&gt;
Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Advanced liver fibrosis is an important predictor of liver disease progression and mortality, and current guidelines recommend screening for complications of cirrhosis once patients develop F3 fibrosis. Our study compared liver disease progression and survival in patients with stage 3 (F3) and stage 4 (F4) fibrosis on liver biopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective study of patients with F3 or F4 on liver biopsy followed for development of liver disease complications (variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy); hepatocellular carcinoma, and survival (overall and transplant free survival).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2488 patients receiving liver biopsy between 01/02 and 12/12, a total of 294 (171 F3) were analyzed. Over a median follow up period of 3 years, patients with F4 (mean age 53 years, 63% male) compared to F3 (mean age 49 years, 43% male) had higher five year cumulative probability of any decompensation (38% vs. 14%, p&amp;lt;0.0001), including variceal bleed (10% vs. 4%, p = 0.014), ascites (21% vs. 9%, p = 0.0014), and hepatic encephalopathy (14% vs. 5%, p = 0.003). F4 patients also had lower overall 5-year survival (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.003) and transplant free survival (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.002). Probability of hepatocellular carcinoma in 5 years after biopsy was similar between F3 and F4 (1.2% vs. 2%, p = 0.54).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Compared to F4 stage, patients with F3 fibrosis have decreased risk for development of liver disease complications and better survival. Prospective well designed studies are suggested with large sample size and overcoming the limitations identified in this study, to confirm and validate these findings, as basis for modifying guidelines and recommendations on follow up of patients with advanced fibrosis and stage 3 liver fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Patients with stage 3 compared to stage 4 liver fibrosis have lower frequency of and longer time to liver disease complications</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197117</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Page Axley, Sandhya Mudumbi, Shabnam Sarker, Yong-Fang Kuo, Ashwani Singal&lt;/p&gt;

The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, have been used as lipid lowering drugs for decades and several epidemiological studies suggest statin usage correlates with a decreased incidence of cancer specific mortality in patients. However, the mechanism of this mortality benefit remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that statin drug lipophilicity and affinity for its target enzyme, HMGCR, determine their growth suppressive potency against various tumor cell lines. The lipophilic atorvastatin decreases cancer cell proliferation and survival &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Statin sensitivity coincided with Ras localization to the cytosol instead of the membrane, consistent with a decrement in prenylation. To investigate signaling pathways that may be involved with sensitivity to statin therapy, we employed inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt and Mek-Erk signaling cascades. We found that inhibition of PI3K signaling through Akt potentiated statin sensitivity of breast cancer cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in co-culture with primary human hepatocytes. The same effect was not observed with inhibition of Mek signaling through Erk. Moreover, the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to atorvastatin-mediated growth suppression correlated with a decrease in EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. As an increase in Akt activity has been shown to be involved in the metastasis and metastatic outgrowth of many cancer types (including breast), these data suggest a mechanism by which statins may reduce cancer specific mortality in patients.</content></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><published>1526418000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Lipophilic statins limit cancer cell growth and survival, via involvement of Akt signaling</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197422</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Colin H.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The first aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between liver stiffness measurement, hepatic venous pressure and liver fibrosis. The second aim was to demonstrate the utility of real-time shear wave elastography for evaluation of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients before and after balloon hepatic venous angioplasty.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 32 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome slated for successful balloon angioplasty met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Shear wave elastography was used to generate dynamic liver stiffness measurement 2 days before angioplasty and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty. Hepatic venous pressures were measured during balloon angioplasty. Correlations among liver stiffness, hepatic venous pressure, and fibrosis were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Mean liver stiffness was 35.17 ± 10.60 kPa, 20.15 ± 5.47 kPa, 15.36 ± 4.34 kPa and 15.68 ± 5.58 kPa at baseline and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty, respectively. Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after angioplasty was significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.001); liver stiffness measured at 6 months after angioplasty was not significantly different from that measured at 3 months after angioplasty (P = 0.636). Analysis of liver stiffness measurement and hepatic venous pressure before balloon angioplasty yielded a coefficient of correlation r = 0.701 (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Before and 2d after angioplasty, liver stiffness measurement did not correlated with fibrosis (r = − 0.170, P = 0.22), (r = 0.223, P = 0.220), respectively, while the LSM difference before and 2 days after angioplasty negatively correlated with stiffness severity (r = − 0.502, P = 0.003). Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after angioplasty was significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.001), remaining stable at 3 months, though still in the cirrhotic range.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The liver stiffness of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients, measured by shear wave elastography, decreased considerably after hepatic venous recanalization, and significantly correlated with hepatic venous pressure though not with degree of fibrosis.

Background &lt;p&gt;Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a new tool developed to overcome some limitations of pairwise meta-analyses. NMAs provide evidence on more than two comparators simultaneously. This study aimed to map the characteristics of the published NMAs on drug therapy comparisons.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic review of NMAs comparing pharmacological interventions was performed. Searches in Medline (PubMed) and Scopus along with manual searches were conducted. The main characteristics of NMAs were systematically collected: publication metadata, criteria for drug inclusion, statistical methods used, and elements reported. A methodological quality score with 25 key elements was created and applied to the included NMAs. To identify potential trends, the median of the publication year distribution was used as a cut-off.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study identified 365 NMAs published from 2003 to 2016 in more than 30 countries. Randomised controlled trials were the primary source of data, with only 5% including observational studies, and 230 NMAs used a placebo as a comparator. Less than 15% of NMAs were registered in PROSPERO or a similar system. One third of studies followed PRISMA and less than 9% Cochrane recommendations. Around 30% presented full-search strategies of the systematic review, and 146 NMAs stated the selection criteria for drug inclusion. Over 75% of NMAs presented network plots, but only half described their geometry. Statistical parameters (model fit, inconsistency, convergence) were properly reported by one third of NMAs. Although 216 studies exhibited supplemental material, no data set of primary studies was available. The methodological quality score (mean 13·9; SD 3·8) presented a slightly positive trend over the years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The map of the published NMAs emphasises the potential of this tool to gather evidence in healthcare, but it also identified some weaknesses, especially in the report, which limits its transparency and reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Mapping the characteristics of network meta-analyses on drug therapy: A systematic review</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196644</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fernanda S.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a cornerstone in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies such as multiple myeloma (MM) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Yet, prolonged GC use is hampered by deleterious GC-related side effects and the emergence of GC resistance. To tackle and overcome these GC-related problems, the applicability of selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and modulators was studied, in search of fewer side-effects and at least equal therapeutic efficacy as classic GCs. Compound A (CpdA) is a prototypical example of such a selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator and does not support GR-mediated transactivation. Here, we examined whether the combination of CpdA with the classic GC dexamethasone (Dex) may improve GC responsiveness of MM and ALL cell lines. We find that the combination of Dex and CpdA does not substantially enhance GC-mediated cell killing. In line, several apoptosis hallmarks, such as caspase 3/7 activity, PARP cleavage and the levels of cleaved-caspase 3 remain unchanged upon combining Dex with CpdA. Moreover, we monitor no additional inhibition of cell proliferation and the homologous downregulation of GR is not counteracted by the combination of Dex and CpdA. In addition, CpdA is unable to modulate Dex-liganded GR transactivation and transrepression, yet, Dex-mediated transrepression is also aberrant in these lymphoid cell lines. Together, transrepression-favoring compounds, alone or combined with GCs, do not seem a valid strategy in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><published>1525813200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Effect of combining glucocorticoids with Compound A on glucocorticoid receptor responsiveness in lymphoid malignancies</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197000</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dorien Clarisse, Karlien Van Wesemael, Jan Tavernier, Fritz Offner, Ilse M.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) proceeds through a series of morphological changes of the plasma membrane induced by a number of protein components. Although the spatiotemporal assembly of these proteins has been elucidated by fluorescence-based techniques, the protein-induced morphological changes of the plasma membrane have not been fully clarified in living cells. Here, we visualize membrane morphology together with protein localizations during CME by utilizing high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) combined with a confocal laser scanning unit. The plasma membrane starts to invaginate approximately 30 s after clathrin starts to assemble, and the aperture diameter increases as clathrin accumulates. Actin rapidly accumulates around the pit and induces a small membrane swelling, which, within 30 s, rapidly covers the pit irreversibly. Inhibition of actin turnover abolishes the swelling and induces a reversible open–close motion of the pit, indicating that actin dynamics are necessary for efficient and irreversible pit closure at the end of CME.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_c4txNHahJg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525370092024</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/_c4txNHahJg/article</href></item></alternate><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Morphological changes of plasma membrane and protein assembly during clathrin-mediated endocytosis</title><recrawled>1525375448507</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aiko Yoshida, Nobuaki Sakai, Yoshitsugu Uekusa, Yuka Imaoka, Yoshitsuna Itagaki, Yuki Suzuki, Shige H.

Inhibition of actin turnover abolishes the swelling and induces a reversible open–close motion of the pit, indicating that actin dynamics are necessary for efficient and irreversible pit closure at the end of CME.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_c4txNHahJg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>9bf22316</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004786</href></item></canonical></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395a4:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/800?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>1216922a</fingerprint><author><name>Muhar, M., Ebert, A., Neumann, T., Umkehrer, C., Jude, J., Wieshofer, C., Rescheneder, P., Lipp, J.

TF knockdown experiments have revealed correlations between TF binding profiles and gene expression levels. We present a general framework capable of predicting genes with similar tissue-wide expression patterns from activated or repressed TF targets using machine learning to combine TF binding and epigenetic features. Methods: Genes with correlated expression patterns across 53 tissues were identified according to their Bray-Curtis similarity. DNase I-accessible promoter intervals of direct TF target genes were scanned with previously derived information theory-based position weight matrices (iPWMs) of 82 TFs. Features from information density-based TFBS clusters were used to predict target genes with machine learning classifiers. The accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the classifiers were determined for different feature sets. Mutations in TFBSs were also introduced to in silico examine their impact on cluster densities and the regulatory states of target genes. Results: We initially chose the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1), whose regulation has been extensively studied, to test this approach. SLC25A32 and TANK were found to exhibit the most similar expression patterns to this gene across 53 tissues. A Decision Tree classifier exhibited the largest area (0.9987 and 0.9956 respectively before and after eliminating inaccessible promoter intervals based on DNase I HyperSensitive Regions (DHSs)) under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve in detecting such coordinately regulated genes.

Frameworks exist for understanding how stochastic fluctuations and transient differences in cell state contribute to experimentally observable variations in cellular responses. However, current methods do not allow identification of the sources of variability between and within stable subpopulations of cells. We present a data-driven modeling framework for the analysis of populations comprising heterogeneous subpopulations. Our approach combines mixture modeling with frameworks for distribution approximation, facilitating the integration of multiple single-cell datasets and the detection of causal differences between and within subpopulations.

Frameworks exist for understanding how stochastic fluctuations and transient differences in cell state contribute to experimentally observable variations in cellular responses. However, current methods do not allow identification of the sources of variability between and within stable subpopulations of cells. We present a data-driven modeling framework for the analysis of populations comprising heterogeneous subpopulations. Our approach combines mixture modeling with frameworks for distribution approximation, facilitating the integration of multiple single-cell datasets and the detection of causal differences between and within subpopulations.

We compared the clinical characteristics, treatments, and prognoses of fungal keratitis in patients with and without diabetes. Patients diagnosed with fungal keratitis at Shandong Eye Institute between January 2010 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and classified as diabetic and nondiabetic groups. One-hundred-and-eleven patients (111 eyes) with diabetes and 740 patients (740 eyes) without diabetes were included. The diabetic patients showed significantly older (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt; 0.05) and lower male:female ratio (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Plants trauma was the primary risk factor in both groups, and there was no significant difference of pathogen type (the most common was &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; genus, followed by &lt;i&gt;Alternaria&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; genera). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that diabetes and topical glucocorticoid use were the independent risk factors for the severity of fungal keratitis. The recurrent infection rate between the diabetic and nondiabetic patients during the follow-up (6 to 24 months) after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) was not significantly different. Although the recurrent epithelial defect, rejection, and best-corrected visual acuity were similar between the patients with matched bed/graft size (7.75/8.0 mm) in the two groups 1 year after PKP, the incidence of delayed re-epithelialization (&gt;7 days) was significantly higher in diabetic patients (3/10 versus 2/43 in nondiabetic patients, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). More specially, the diabetic patients with the duration ≥10 years showed more significantly delayed re-epithelialization than those with the diabetic duration less than 10 years (3/5 versus 1/26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In conclusion, the diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor that affect the severity of fungal keratitis. Corneal re-epithelialization was significantly delayed after PKP in the diabetic patients, especially with the duration ≥10 years.</content></content><updated>1525208400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><published>1525208400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Clinical analysis of fungal keratitis in patients with and without diabetes</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196741</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Dan, Qingjun Zhou, Hualei Zhai, Jun Cheng, Lei Wan, Cheng Ge, Lixin Xie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is a vector-borne bacterial infection that is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. If not treated with antibiotics during the early stages of infection, disseminated infection can spread to the central nervous system (CNS). In non-human primates (NHPs) it has been demonstrated that the leptomeninges are among the tissues colonized by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; spirochetes. Although the NHP model parallels aspects of human borreliosis, a small rodent model would be ideal to study the trafficking of spirochetes and immune cells into the CNS. Here we show that during early and late disseminated infection, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; infects the meninges of intradermally infected mice, and is associated with concurrent increases in meningeal T cells. We found that the dura mater was consistently culture positive for spirochetes in transcardially perfused mice, independent of the strain of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; used. Within the dura mater, spirochetes were preferentially located in vascular regions, but were also present in perivascular, and extravascular regions, as late as 75 days post-infection. At the same end-point, we observed significant increases in the number of CD3+ T cells within the pia and dura mater, as compared to controls.

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is a vector-borne bacterial infection that is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. If not treated with antibiotics during the early stages of infection, disseminated infection can spread to the central nervous system (CNS). In non-human primates (NHPs) it has been demonstrated that the leptomeninges are among the tissues colonized by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; spirochetes. Although the NHP model parallels aspects of human borreliosis, a small rodent model would be ideal to study the trafficking of spirochetes and immune cells into the CNS. Here we show that during early and late disseminated infection, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; infects the meninges of intradermally infected mice, and is associated with concurrent increases in meningeal T cells. We found that the dura mater was consistently culture positive for spirochetes in transcardially perfused mice, independent of the strain of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; used. Within the dura mater, spirochetes were preferentially located in vascular regions, but were also present in perivascular, and extravascular regions, as late as 75 days post-infection. At the same end-point, we observed significant increases in the number of CD3+ T cells within the pia and dura mater, as compared to controls. Flow cytometric analysis of leukocytes isolated from the dura mater revealed that CD3+ cell populations were comprised of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that similarly to infection in peripheral tissues, spirochetes adhere to the dura mater during disseminated infection, and are associated with increases in the number of meningeal T cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that there are aspects of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; meningeal infection that can be modelled in laboratory mice, suggesting that mice may be useful for elucidating mechanisms of meningeal pathogenesis by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;.</description><fingerprint>fe2946bc</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196893</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1635e996724:2eeba1e:3dd877af</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259424v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>164e6c39</fingerprint><author><name>Brand, P.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The sense of smell enables the detection and discrimination of airborne chemicals via chemosensory receptors that have evolved independently multiple times throughout the tree of life.

Population dynamics in urban and rural areas are different. Understanding factors that contribute to local population changes has various socioeconomic and political implications. In the present study, we use population census data in Japan to examine contributors to the population growth of residential clusters between years 2005 and 2010. The data set covers the entirety of Japan and has a high spatial resolution of 500 × 500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, enabling us to examine population dynamics in various parts of the country (urban and rural) using statistical analysis. We found that, in addition to the area, population density, and age, the shape of the cluster and the spatial distribution of inhabitants within the cluster are significantly related to the population growth rate of a residential cluster. Specifically, the population tends to grow if the cluster is &amp;quot;round&amp;quot; shaped (given the area) and the population is concentrated near the center rather than periphery of the cluster. Combination of the present results and analysis framework with other factors that have been omitted in the present study, such as migration, terrain, and transportation infrastructure, will be fruitful.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><published>1525899600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Population changes in residential clusters in Japan</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197144</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takuya Sekiguchi, Kohei Tamura, Naoki Masuda&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (BVS) were introduced to overcome some of the limitations of drug-eluting stent (DES) for PCI. Data regarding the clinical outcomes of the BVS versus DES beyond 2 years are emerging.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To study mid-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We searched online databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, CENTRAL), several websites, meeting presentations and scientific session abstracts until August 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2017 for studies comparing Absorb BVS with second-generation DES. The primary outcome was target lesion failure (TLF). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR) and definite/probable device thrombosis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using a random effects model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ten studies, seven randomized controlled trials and three propensity-matched observational studies, with a total of 7320 patients (BVS n = 4007; DES n = 3313) and a median follow-up duration of 30.5 months, were included. Risk of TLF was increased for BVS-treated patients (OR 1.34 [95% CI: 1.12–1.60], p = 0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). This was also the case for all myocardial infarction (1.58 [95% CI: 1.27–1.96], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), TLR (1.48 [95% CI: 1.19–1.85], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%) and definite/probable device thrombosis (of 2.82 (95% CI: 1.86–3.89], p&amp;lt;0.001 and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 40.3%). This did not result in a difference in all-cause mortality (0.78 [95% CI: 0.58–1.04], p = 0.09, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%).

For drove a conclusions we compere amount of CO2 detected in DEMS during ethanol oxidation reaction and so called CO stripping experiment.</description><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/On_the_Lack_of_Beneficial_Role_of_Rh_Towards_C-C_Bond_Cleavage_During_Low_Temperature_Ethanol_Electrooxidation_on_Pt-Rh_Nanoalloys/6281264</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197528.g001</url><height>367</height><contentType>image/png</contentType><width>320</width></visual><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b35d987:153251d:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197528</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197528</canonicalUrl><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525975210375</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: Conservation and lineage-specific rearrangements in the GOBP/PBP gene complex of distantly related ditrysian Lepidoptera</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197528</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>2459e1c5</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197528</link></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395da:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/699?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>7542d516</fingerprint><author><name>Hutson, M.</name></author><engagement>42</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><published>1526578752000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Boycott highlights AI&apos;s publishing rebellion</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/699.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/699?rss=1</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Engineering, Scientific Community</item></keywords><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/699?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b7b:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197270</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197270</canonicalUrl><author><name>Pavel Dietz</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pavel Dietz, Anne Quermann, Mireille Nicoline Maria van Poppel, Heiko Striegel, Hannes Schröter, Rolf Ulrich, Perikles Simon&lt;/p&gt;

Adult male C57BL/6J mice have previously been reported to have motor and memory deficits after experimental closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI), without associated gross pathologic damage or neuroimaging changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging protocols. The presence of neurologic deficits, however, suggests neural damage or dysfunction in these animals. Accordingly, we undertook a histologic analysis of mice after TBI. Gross pathology and histologic analysis using Nissl stain and NeuN immunohistochemistry demonstrated no obvious tissue damage or neuron loss. However, Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed myelin injury in the optic tract, while Fluoro Jade B and silver degeneration staining revealed evidence of axonal neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and superior colliculus (detectable at 7 days, but not 24 hours, after injury). Fluoro Jade B staining was not detectable in other white matter tracts, brain regions or in cell somata. In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Optic tract injury after closed head traumatic brain injury in mice: A model of indirect traumatic optic neuropathy</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197346</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan K.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Although locally invasive or recurrent fibromatosis is primarily treated with surgery, radiotherapy (RT) produces local control for recurrent/unresectable tumors or those with positive surgical margins. Herein, we describe our updated institutional experience with RT to treat fibromatosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven patients with fibromatosis received RT between 1990 and 2015, and were followed for ≥12 months. Eight patients received RT for gross tumors, and 39 received postoperative RT after single/multiple prior surgeries. A median dose of 54 Gy was prescribed for definitive RT; 48.6, 50.4, and 54 Gy were prescribed for R0, R1, and R2 resected tumors, respectively. Recurrences were classified as in-field, marginal, or out-field. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven recurrences were noted, including 2 in-field, 4 marginal, and 1 out-field, after a median follow-up of 60 months. In-field recurrences occurred in 1 patient who received 40.5 Gy of salvage RT after postoperative recurrence and another who received 45 Gy for R1 resection after multiple prior operations. All marginal failures were due to insufficient clinical target volume (CTV) margins regardless of dose (3 with 45 Gy and 1 with 54 Gy). On multivariate analysis, a CTV margin ≥5 cm and dose &gt;45 Gy were significant predictors of non-recurrence (p = 0.039 and 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with both an CTV margin ≥5 cm and a dose &gt;45 Gy showed a favorable outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RT is a valuable option for treating aggressive fibromatosis; doses ≥45 Gy and a large field produce optimal results. For in-field control, a higher dose is more necessary for gross residual tumors than for totally excised lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527627600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><published>1527627600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Optimal radiotherapy strategy for primary or recurrent fibromatosis and long-term results</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198134</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seo Hee Choi, Hong In Yoon, Seung Hyun Kim, Sang Kyum Kim, Kyoo-Ho Shin, Chang-Ok Suh&lt;/p&gt;

In-field recurrences occurred in 1 patient who received 40.5 Gy of salvage RT after postoperative recurrence and another who received 45 Gy for R1 resection after multiple prior operations. All marginal failures were due to insufficient clinical target volume (CTV) margins regardless of dose (3 with 45 Gy and 1 with 54 Gy). On multivariate analysis, a CTV margin ≥5 cm and dose &gt;45 Gy were significant predictors of non-recurrence (p = 0.039 and 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with both an CTV margin ≥5 cm and a dose &gt;45 Gy showed a favorable outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RT is a valuable option for treating aggressive fibromatosis; doses ≥45 Gy and a large field produce optimal results. For in-field control, a higher dose is more necessary for gross residual tumors than for totally excised lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>377d764e</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198134</link></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1638d3b4912:75f58ad:93d646dc</id><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Achilles_heel_of_Iron-Based_Catalysts_During_Oxygen_Reduction_in_Acidic_Medium/6304460</originId><fingerprint>5b35f1e6</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Fuel cells efficiently convert chemical into electric energy, with promising application for clean transportation.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells. An imbalance in the differentiation of these lineages could affect the preservation of bone integrity. Several studies have suggested the importance of this imbalance in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis after kidney transplant (KT), but the role of bone marrow adiposity in this process is not well known, and if the treatment with the anti-absorptive (zoledronic acid-ZA) drugs could attenuate bone loss. Thus, our objective was compare bone marrow adiposity, osteoblasts and osteocytes before and after KT, verify an association between bone remodeling process (Turnover, Volume, and Mineralization—TMV classification), the osteocyte sclerostin expression to evaluate if there is a role of Wnt pathway, as well as the effect of ZA on these cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 29 new living-donor KT patients. One group received ZA at the time of KT plus cholecalciferol for twelve months, and the other group received only cholecalciferol. Bone biopsies were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Histomorphometric evaluation was performed in bone and bone marrow adipocytes. Sclerostin (Scl) expression in osteocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Some bone marrow adiposity parameters were increased before KT. After KT, some of them remained increased and they worsened with the use of ZA. In the baseline, lower bone Volume and Turnover, were associated with increased bone marrow adiposity parameters (some of them). After KT, both groups showed the same associations. Osteocyte Scl expression after KT decreased with the use of ZA. We observed also an inverse association between bone adiposity parameters and lower osteocyte sclerostin expression 12 months after KT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the present study suggests that KT fails to normalize bone marrow adiposity, and it even gets worse with the use of ZA. Moreover, bone marrow adiposity is inversely associated with bone Volume and Turnover, which seems to be accentuated by the antiresorptive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527282000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><published>1527282000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The effect of vitamin D and zoledronic acid in bone marrow adiposity in kidney transplant patients: A &amp;lt;i&gt;post hoc&amp;lt;/i&gt; analysis</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197994</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mariel J.

Thus, our objective was compare bone marrow adiposity, osteoblasts and osteocytes before and after KT, verify an association between bone remodeling process (Turnover, Volume, and Mineralization—TMV classification), the osteocyte sclerostin expression to evaluate if there is a role of Wnt pathway, as well as the effect of ZA on these cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 29 new living-donor KT patients. One group received ZA at the time of KT plus cholecalciferol for twelve months, and the other group received only cholecalciferol. Bone biopsies were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Histomorphometric evaluation was performed in bone and bone marrow adipocytes. Sclerostin (Scl) expression in osteocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Some bone marrow adiposity parameters were increased before KT. After KT, some of them remained increased and they worsened with the use of ZA. In the baseline, lower bone Volume and Turnover, were associated with increased bone marrow adiposity parameters (some of them). After KT, both groups showed the same associations. Osteocyte Scl expression after KT decreased with the use of ZA. We observed also an inverse association between bone adiposity parameters and lower osteocyte sclerostin expression 12 months after KT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the present study suggests that KT fails to normalize bone marrow adiposity, and it even gets worse with the use of ZA. Moreover, bone marrow adiposity is inversely associated with bone Volume and Turnover, which seems to be accentuated by the antiresorptive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>a47a0c0b</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197994</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16364b00c6f:39bf34b:93d646dc</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323204v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>ee6fd14f</fingerprint><author><name>Martinez, G.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Intestinal health of weaning piglets was studied after oral treatments with fosfomycin (FOS), Cynara scolymus extract (CSE), deoxynivalenol (DON) and their combinations.

Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) and mouse models of hair graying serve as useful systems to uncover mechanisms involved in stem cell self-renewal and the maintenance of regenerating tissues. Interested in assessing genetic variants that influence McSC maintenance, we found previously that heterozygosity for the melanogenesis associated transcription factor, &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt;, exacerbates McSC differentiation and hair graying in mice that are predisposed for this phenotype. Based on transcriptome and molecular analyses of &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;mi-vga9/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, we report a novel role for MITF in the regulation of systemic innate immune gene expression. We also demonstrate that the viral mimic poly(I:C) is sufficient to expose genetic susceptibility to hair graying. These observations point to a critical suppressor of innate immunity, the consequences of innate immune dysregulation on pigmentation, both of which may have implications in the autoimmune, depigmenting disease, vitiligo.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/N1nbD-4XsNQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525370092024</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/N1nbD-4XsNQ/article</href></item></alternate><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A direct link between MITF, innate immunity, and hair graying</title><recrawled>1525375448507</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Melissa L.

There is a severe lack of aphasia screening tools for bedside use in Chinese. A number of aphasia assessment tools have recently been developed abroad, but some of these scales were not suitable for patients with acute stroke. The Language Screening Test (which includes two parallel versions [a/b]) in French has been proven to be an effective and time-saving aphasia screening scale for early-stage stroke patients. Therefore, we worked out a Chinese version of the LAST taking into consideration Chinese language and culture. Two preliminary parallel versions (a/b) were tested on 154 patients with stroke at acute phase and 107 patients with stroke at non-acute phase, with the Western Aphasia Battery serving as a gold standard. The equivalence between the two parallel versions and the reliability/validity of each version were assessed. The median time to complete one preliminary Chinese version (each had some item redundancy) was 98 seconds. Two final parallel versions were established after adjustment/elimination of the redundant items and were found to be equivalent (intra-class correlation coefficient: 0.991). Internal consistency is(Cronbach α for each version [a/b] was 0.956 and 0.965, respectively) good. Internal validity was fine: (a) no floor or ceiling effect/item redundancy; (b) construct validity revealed a 1-dimension structure, just like the French version. The higher educated subjects scored higher than their lower educated counterparts (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;). The external validity: at the optimum cut-off point where the score of version a/b &amp;lt;14 in higher educated group(&amp;lt;13 in lower): the specificity of each version was 0.878/0.902(1/1 in lower) and sensitivity was 0.972/0.944(0.944/0.944 in lower). Inter-rater equivalence (intra-class correlation coefficient) was 1. The Chinese version of the Language Screening Test was proved to be an efficient and time-saving bedside aphasia screening tool for stroke patients at acute phase and can be used by an average medical physician.</content></content><updated>1525467600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525455544496</crawled><published>1525467600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A Chinese version of the Language Screening Test (CLAST) for early-stage stroke patients</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196646</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongyan Yang, Shenghua Tian, Constance Flamand-Roze, Ling Gao, Wei Zhang, Yan Li, Jiajia Wang, Zhou Sun, Ying Su, Libin Zhao, Zhihou Liang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The discussion on the use of bevacizumab is still ongoing and often doctors are deterred from using bevacizumab due to legal or political issues. Bevacizumab is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), albeit unregistered for the disease. Therefore, in some countries ophthalmologists use the equally effective but expensive drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept. We describe the economic consequences of this dilemma surrounding AMD treatment from a societal perspective.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We modelled cost-effectiveness of treatment with ranibizumab (as-needed), aflibercept (bimonthly) and bevacizumab (as-needed). Effectiveness was estimated by systematic review and meta-analysis. The drug with the most favourable cost-effectiveness profile compared to bevacizumab was used for threshold analyses. First, we determined how much we overspend per injection. Second, we calculated the required effectiveness to justify the current price and the reasonable price for a drug leading to optimal vision. Finally, we estimated how much Europe overspends if bevacizumab is not first choice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab treatment costs €27,087 per year, about €4,000 less than aflibercept and €6,000 less than ranibizumab. With similar effectiveness for all drugs as shown by meta-analysis, bevacizumab was the most cost-effective. Aflibercept was chosen for threshold analyses. Aflibercept costs €943 per injection, but we determined that the maximum price to be cost-effective is €533. Alternatively, at its current price, aflibercept should yield about twice the visual gain. Even when optimal vision can be achieved, the maximum price for any treatment is €37,453 per year. Most importantly, Europe overspends €335 million yearly on AMD treatment when choosing aflibercept over bevacizumab.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab is the most cost-effective treatment for AMD, yet is not the standard of care across Europe. The registered drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept lead to large overspending without additional health benefits. Health authorities should consider taking steps to implement bevacizumab into clinical practice as first choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><published>1526590800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration—A cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197670</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Freekje van Asten, Charlotte T.

Group B &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GBS) carriage by pregnant women is the primary risk factor for early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) can prevent this transmission route, and two main approaches are recommended to base the selection of pregnant women to be submitted to IAP: the risk-based and the culture-based strategies. In Brazil, compliance to such recommendations is poor, and not much is known about GBS carriage. In the present study, 3,647 pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were screened for GBS anogenital colonization, over a period of 8 years (2008–2015). GBS was detected in 956 (26.2%) of them, and presence of vaginal discharge was the only trait associated with a higher risk for GBS colonization. Serotypes Ia (257; 37.3%) and II (137; 19.9%) were the most frequent among 689 (72.1% of the total) GBS isolates evaluated, followed by NT isolates (84; 12.1%), serotype Ib (77; 11.1%), V (63; 9.1%), III (47; 6.8%) and IV (24; 3.5%). Estimated coverage of major serotype-based GBS vaccines currently under clinical trials would vary from 65.2% to 84.3%. All 689 isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, and tetracycline was observed in 5% (35), 2% (14), 14% (97), 5% (35) and 86% (592) of the isolates, respectively. No significant fluctuations in colonization rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were observed throughout the period of time investigated. The culture-based approach for IAP recommendation showed to be the best choice for the population investigated when compared to the risk-based, since the first did not increase the number of pregnant women submitted to antibiotic therapy and covered a larger number of women who were actually colonized by GBS. The fact the not all isolates were available for additional characterization, and serotype IX antiserum was not available for testing represent limitations of this study. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest investigation on GBS carriage among pregnant women in Brazil up to date, and results are useful for improving GBS prevention and treatment strategies.</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><published>1526072400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Streptococcus agalactiae&amp;lt;/i&gt; carriage among pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, over a period of eight years</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196925</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Caroline N.

Purkinje neuron dendritic degeneration precedes cell loss in cerebellar ataxia, but the basis for dendritic vulnerability in ataxia remains poorly understood. Recent work has suggested that potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channel dysfunction and consequent spiking abnormalities contribute to Purkinje neuron degeneration, but little attention has been paid to how K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel dysfunction impacts dendritic excitability and the role this may play in the degenerative process. We examined the relationship between K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel dysfunction, dendritic excitability and dendritic degeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Examination of published RNA sequencing data from SCA1 mice revealed reduced expression of several K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels that are important regulators of excitability in Purkinje neuron dendrites. Patch clamp recordings in Purkinje neurons from SCA1 mice identified increased dendritic excitability in the form of enhanced back-propagation of action potentials and an increased propensity to produce dendritic calcium spikes. Dendritic excitability could be rescued by restoring expression of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels and activating other K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels with baclofen. Importantly, this treatment combination improves motor performance and mitigates dendritic degeneration in SCA1 mice. These results suggest that reduced expression of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels results in persistently increased dendritic excitability at all stages of disease in SCA1, which in turn may contribute to the dendritic degeneration that precedes cell loss.</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><published>1527714000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Dendritic potassium channel dysfunction may contribute to dendrite degeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198040</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>14d4bf4d</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ravi Chopra, David D.

Background &lt;p&gt;Dengue outbreaks are increasing in frequency over space and time, affecting people’s health and burdening resource-constrained health systems. The ability to detect early emerging outbreaks is key to mounting an effective response. The early warning and response system (EWARS) is a toolkit that provides countries with early-warning systems for efficient and cost-effective local responses. EWARS uses outbreak and alarm indicators to derive prediction models that can be used prospectively to predict a forthcoming dengue outbreak at district level.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We report on the development of the EWARS tool, based on users’ recommendations into a convenient, user-friendly and reliable software aided by a user’s workbook and its field testing in 30 health districts in Brazil, Malaysia and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;34 Health officers from the 30 study districts who had used the original EWARS for 7 to 10 months responded to a questionnaire with mainly open-ended questions. Qualitative content analysis showed that participants were generally satisfied with the tool but preferred open-access vs. commercial software. EWARS users also stated that the geographical unit should be the district, while access to meteorological information should be improved. These recommendations were incorporated into the second-generation EWARS-R, using the free R software, combined with recent surveillance data and resulted in higher sensitivities and positive predictive values of alarm signals compared to the first-generation EWARS. Currently the use of satellite data for meteorological information is being tested and a dashboard is being developed to increase user-friendliness of the tool. The inclusion of other &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; borne viral diseases is under discussion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;EWARS is a pragmatic and useful tool for detecting imminent dengue outbreaks to trigger early response activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525467600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525455544496</crawled><published>1525467600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Early warning and response system (EWARS) for dengue outbreaks: Recent advancements towards widespread applications in critical settings</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196811</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laith Hussain-Alkhateeb, Axel Kroeger, Piero Olliaro, Joacim Rocklöv, Maquins Odhiambo Sewe, Gustavo Tejeda, David Benitez, Balvinder Gill, S.

The inclusion of other &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; borne viral diseases is under discussion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;EWARS is a pragmatic and useful tool for detecting imminent dengue outbreaks to trigger early response activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>46706e43</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196811</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e5a:fc1f8953</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196647</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196647</canonicalUrl><author><name>Daniel Scarr</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Scarr, Leif E.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Point-of-care nerve conduction devices (POCD) have been studied in younger patients and may facilitate screening for polyneuropathy in non-specialized clinical settings.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In Germany, a 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for elderly (60+) and patients 16+ with chronic diseases not associated with immune suppression. For all other patients at risk, sequential immunization with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) first, followed by PPSV23 is recommended. Repeated vaccination with PPSV23 is recommended every 6 years after individual assessment by the physician. This was adopted into the vaccination directive with binding reimbursement and funding. However, additional voluntary services allow statutory health insurances to differentiate from each other. Aim of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of voluntary service scenarios compared to the strategy in place to support informed decision making.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A microsimulation framework with Markov-type process of a population susceptible to pneumococcal disease over a lifetime horizon was developed to compare effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different vaccination strategies. We simulated 1,000 iterations for seven scenarios.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In Germany, a 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for elderly (60+) and patients 16+ with chronic diseases not associated with immune suppression. For all other patients at risk, sequential immunization with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) first, followed by PPSV23 is recommended. Repeated vaccination with PPSV23 is recommended every 6 years after individual assessment by the physician. This was adopted into the vaccination directive with binding reimbursement and funding. However, additional voluntary services allow statutory health insurances to differentiate from each other. Aim of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of voluntary service scenarios compared to the strategy in place to support informed decision making.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A microsimulation framework with Markov-type process of a population susceptible to pneumococcal disease over a lifetime horizon was developed to compare effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different vaccination strategies. We simulated 1,000 iterations for seven scenarios. Assumptions were derived from published literature and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was run to show the robustness of the model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our study indicates that all voluntary service strategies could prevent further clinical cases compared to the existing policy. Depending on the scenario, 48–142 invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), 24,000–45,000 hospitalized all-cause nonbacteremic pneumonia (NBP), 15,000–45,000 outpatient NBP cases, and 4,000–8,000 deaths could be avoided on average. This refers to potential savings of €115 Mio. - €187 Mio. for medical and non-medical costs. Additional costs per patient for the payer are €2.48 to €7.13 and for the society €2.20 to €6.85.

They’re specifically addressing the “make it less lipophilic” rule of thumb that many medicinal chemists have, and they demonstrate that this isn’t exactly a universal law. You have to take it case by case, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re working from Genentech’s large database of rat i.v. PK data, stability in rat heptatocytes, and measured (not calculated) logD values. That’s a lot of hard-won data (4767 compounds total), and I’m glad that they’re sharing conclusion from it. The plot at right is an example; each dot is a compound, and they’re shaded according to logD values (&amp;lt;0 to &gt;4). What you see is that IV clearance and (unbound, steady-state) volume of distribution are strongly correlated, and that for the most part this graph is spread along compound lipophilicity. There are outliers (there are always outliers), but that’s the way to bet. As for half-life itself, the spreads in the data are pretty wide, but if anything, higher lipophilicity is correlated with longer i.v. half-life. The Merck paper linked to above also noted that increasing lipophilicity can be a way to extend half-life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in that paper, the Genentech team also did an extensive matched-molecular-pairs analysis, and they found a number of transformations that have a good probability of extending half-life (and they’re similar to the earlier paper). Nitrile to fluoroalkyl, methyl to fluorinated methyl, H to CF3, and tetrahydropyran to phenyl all have a good shot. In general, improving clearance in the rat hepatocyte assay has about a 67% chance of helping your half-life, and if you can do that without decreasing lipophilicity, you have an 82% shot. (I would guess that many of those are fluorinations and chlorinations). Just lowering the LogD, on the other hand, only works about 30% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But wait”, you may be saying. “If I start halogenating my compound, its solubility will probably go to pieces and its off-target binding may well go up!” This, in those deal-with-the-devil stories, is the point where the mysterious stranger slips up and his business partner catches a glimpse of his cloven feet. That is exactly the sort of deal being offered by pharmacokinetics and compound property analysis: no free lunch has yet been delivered. You have to make these changes in full knowledge that helping one aspect of the compound’s behavior may well hurt another one, and proceed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis (as the paper notes) doesn’t deal with charged compounds; they’re a whole other subject. And it also doesn’t go into the other ways around these problems, such as slow-release formulations, etc. But discovery-phase projects generally aren’t thinking about those things either – they’re trying to get compound behavior that doesn’t need the extra work later on. So if you’re in that part of the business, the advice from this paper is to pay attention to hepatocyte clearance assays, don’t be afraid to keep your lipophilicity where it is (or even raise it a bit, while watching for potential trouble), and don’t assume that just making the compound more polar is going to fix much of anything. And pay attention to metabolic hot spots – those are a big reason why those halogenations keep working  in these analyses. It’s more work to do metabolite ID, and often more difficult, chemically, to address those problems than it is to make general polarity changes. But it’s time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Here’s another solid pharmacokinetics paper, this one from Genentech, with advice on how to extend drug half-life (compare this other recent one).

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011–2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim. Bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to yield odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were a total of 612 IFH claims made in the ED from 2011–2013. The demographic characteristics, acuity of presentation and discharge diagnoses were similar during both the before and after periods. Overall, 28.6% fewer claims were made under the IFH program after the cuts. Of the claims made, significantly more were rejected after the cuts than before (13.7% after vs. 3.9% before, adjusted OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.18–8.40; p&amp;lt;0.05).

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011–2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim. Bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to yield odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were a total of 612 IFH claims made in the ED from 2011–2013. The demographic characteristics, acuity of presentation and discharge diagnoses were similar during both the before and after periods. Overall, 28.6% fewer claims were made under the IFH program after the cuts. Of the claims made, significantly more were rejected after the cuts than before (13.7% after vs. 3.9% before, adjusted OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.18–8.40; p&amp;lt;0.05). The majority (75.0%) of rejected claims have not been paid by patients. Fewer patients after the cuts indicated that they had a family physician (20.4% after vs. 30% before, unadjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14–2.44; p&amp;lt;0.05) yet a higher proportion of patients without a family physician were still advised to follow up with their family doctor during the after period (67.2% after vs. 41.8% before, unadjusted OR 2.85, 95% CI: 1.45–5.62; p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of both rejected and subsequently unpaid claims after the IFH cuts in June 2012, as demonstrated in the logistic regression analysis in this health records review, represents a potential barrier to emergency medical care, as well as a new financial burden to be shouldered by patients and hospitals.

Because punishments are expected to give offenders what they deserve proportionally to the severity of their offenses, the punishment of an entire group because of the misdeed of a few of its members is generally considered as unfair. Group entitativity might increase support for such collective punishment, because members of highly entitative groups are perceived as more similar and interchangeable. We designed three experiments comparing support for third-party collective punishment of low versus high entitative groups. As comparison base-rate, we included conditions in which participants punish an individual wrongdoer (Experiments 1 &amp;amp; 2). Results show that although support for individual punishment is higher than support for collective punishment, this difference was reduced (Experiment 1) or absent (Experiment 2) when the group was highly entitative. Experiment 3 replicated the increasing effect of group entitativity on support for collective punishment. We conclude that group entitativity increases the likelihood of an entire group being treated as a single unit, facilitating collective punishment when a few group members commit an offense.</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Why we sometimes punish the innocent: The role of group entitativity in collective punishment</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196852</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Pereira, Jan-Willem van Prooijen&lt;/p&gt;

The controlled formation and stabilization of E-cadherin-based adhesions is vital for epithelial integrity. This requires co-operation between the E-cadherin-based adhesions and the associated actin cytoskeleton. In cancer, this co-operation often fails, predisposing cells to migration through molecular mechanisms that have only been partially characterized. Here, we demonstrate that the actin filament cross-linker α-actinin-1 is frequently increased in human breast cancer. In mammary epithelial cells, the increased α-actinin-1 levels promote cell migration and induce disorganized acini-like structures in Matrigel. This is accompanied by a major reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the associated E-cadherin-based adhesions. Increased expression of α-actinin-1 is particularly noted in basal-like breast cancer cell lines, and in breast cancer patients it associates with poor prognosis in basal-like subtypes. Downregulation of α-actinin-1 in E-cadherin expressing basal-like breast cancer cells demonstrate that α-actinin-1-assembled actin fibers destabilize E-cadherin-based adhesions. Taken together, these results indicate that increased α-actinin-1 expression destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions, which is likely to promote the migratory potential of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our results identify α-actinin-1 as a candidate prognostic biomarker in basal-like breast cancer.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><published>1525899600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Increased α-actinin-1 destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions and associates with poor prognosis in basal-like breast cancer</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196986</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Kovac, Tomi P.

During the development of the visual system, high levels of energy are expended propelling axons from the retina to the brain. However, the role of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism in the development of the visual system has been overlooked. Here, we report that the carbohydrate metabolites succinate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and their respective receptor—GPR91 and GPR99—are involved in modulating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) projections toward the thalamus during visual system development. Using ex vivo and in vivo approaches, combined with pharmacological and genetic analyses, we revealed that GPR91 and GPR99 are expressed on axons of developing RGCs and have complementary roles during RGC axon growth in an extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;)-dependent manner. However, they have no effects on axon guidance. These findings suggest an important role for these receptors during the establishment of the visual system and provide a foundational link between carbohydrate metabolism and axon growth.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/N_QnsknNcYM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526579742221</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/N_QnsknNcYM/article</href></item></alternate><published>1526590800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Receptors of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism, GPR91 and GPR99, mediate axon growth</title><recrawled>1526579829417</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hosni Cherif, François Duhamel, Bruno Cécyre, Alex Bouchard, Ariane Quintal, Sylvain Chemtob, Jean-François Bouchard&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, we highlight several cases where the group is more or less reliable.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/15/318360</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318360v1?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_163ad4688a8:21a1188:2835af05</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5804.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5804</canonicalUrl><author><name>Ludmilla Bar, Martina Feger, Abul Faȷol, Lars–Oliver Klotz, Shufei Zeng, Florian Lang, Berthold Hocher, Michael Foller</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is produced by bone cells and regulates renal phosphate and vitamin D metabolism, as well as causing left ventricular hypertrophy.

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, can elude hosts’ innate and adaptive immunity as part of the course of infection. The ability of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; to invade or be internalized by host cells in vitro has been proposed as a mechanism for the pathogen to evade immune responses or antimicrobials. We have previously shown that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; can be internalized by human neuroglial cells. In this study we demonstrate that these cells take up &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; via coiling phagocytosis mediated by the formin, Daam1, a process similarly described for human macrophages. Following coincubation with glial cells, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was enwrapped by Daam1-enriched coiling pseudopods. Coiling of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was significantly reduced when neuroglial cells were pretreated with anti-Daam1 antibody indicating the requirement for Daam1 for borrelial phagocytosis. Confocal microscopy showed Daam1 colocalizing to the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface suggesting interaction with borrelial membrane protein(s). Using the yeast 2-hybrid system for identifying protein-protein binding, we found that the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface lipoprotein, BBA66, bound the FH2 subunit domain of Daam1. Recombinant proteins were used to validate binding by ELISA, pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation. Evidence for native Daam1 and BBA66 interaction was suggested by colocalization of the proteins in the course of borrelial capture by the Daam1-enriched pseudopodia. Additionally, we found a striking reduction in coiling for a BBA66-deficient mutant strain compared to BBA66-expressing strains. These results show that coiling phagocytosis is a mechanism for borrelial internalization by neuroglial cells mediated by Daam1.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Human neuroglial cells internalize &amp;lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&amp;lt;/i&gt; by coiling phagocytosis mediated by Daam1</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197413</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shanna K.

The mammalian secretoglobin (SCGB) superfamily contains functionally diverse members, among which the major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse salivary androgen-binding protein (ABP) display similar subunits. We searched for molecular similarities between Fel d 1 and ABP to examine the possibility that they play similar roles. We aimed to i) cluster the evolutionary relationships of the SCGB superfamily; ii) identify divergence patterns, structural overlap, and protein-protein docking between Fel d 1 and ABP dimers; and iii) explore the residual interaction between ABP dimers and steroid binding in chemical communication using computational approaches. We also report that the evolutionary tree of the SCGB superfamily comprises seven unique palm-like clusters, showing the evolutionary pattern and divergence time tree of Fel d 1 with 28 ABP paralogs. Three ABP subunits (A27, BG27, and BG26) share phylogenetic relationships with Fel d 1 chains. The Fel d 1 and ABP subunits show similarities in terms of sequence conservation, identical motifs and binding site clefts. Topologically equivalent positions were visualized through superimposition of ABP A27:BG27 (AB) and ABP A27:BG26 (AG) dimers on a heterodimeric Fel d 1 model. In docking, Fel d 1-ABP dimers exhibit the maximum surface binding ability of AG compared with that of AB dimers and the several polar interactions between ABP dimers with steroids. Hence, cat Fel d 1 is an ABP-like molecule in which monomeric chains 1 and 2 are the equivalent of the ABPA and ABPBG monomers, respectively. These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding.</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><published>1526590800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Another cat and mouse game: Deciphering the evolution of the SCGB superfamily and exploring the molecular similarity of major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse ABP using computational approaches</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rajesh Durairaj, Patrick Pageat, Cécile Bienboire-Frosini&lt;/p&gt;

Such antibodies target the HIV-1-envelope (Env) trimer, which is shielded from immune recognition by extraordinary glycosylation and sequence variability. Recognition by broadly neutralizing antibodies thus provides insight into how antibody can bypass these immune-evasion mechanisms. Remarkably, antibodies neutralizing &gt;25% of HIV-1 strains have now been identified that recognize all major exposed surfaces of the prefusion-closed Env trimer. Here we analyzed all 206 broadly neutralizing antibody-HIV-1 Env complexes in the PDB with resolution suitable to define their interaction chemistries. These segregated into 20 antibody classes based on ontogeny and recognition, and into 6 epitope categories (V1V2, glycan-V3, CD4-binding site, silent face center, fusion peptide, and subunit interface) based on recognized Env residues. We measured antibody neutralization on a 208-isolate panel and analyzed features of paratope and B cell ontogeny. The number of protruding loops, CDR H3 length, and level of somatic hypermutation for broadly HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies were significantly higher than for a comparison set of non-HIV-1 antibodies. For epitope, the number of independent sequence segments was higher (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), as well as the glycan component surface area (P = 0.0005). Based on B cell ontogeny, paratope, and breadth, the CD4-binding site antibody IOMA appeared to be a promising candidate for lineage-based vaccine design. In terms of epitope-based vaccine design, antibody VRC34.01 had few epitope segments, low epitope-glycan content, and high epitope-conformational variability, which may explain why VRC34.01-based design is yielding promising vaccine results.</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525286917413</crawled><published>1525244400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Structural survey of HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies targeting Env trimer delineates epitope categories and suggests vaccine templates [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/312579v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><description>HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies are desired for their therapeutic potential and as templates for vaccine design.

The objectives of this study are to analyze the associations between educational levels and poor self-rated health (SRH) among adults in Brazil and to assess trends in the prevalence of poor self-rated health across educational groups between 1998 and 2013. Individual-level data came from the 1998, 2003 and 2008 Brazilian National Household Survey and the 2013 National Health Survey. We estimate prevalence rates of poor SRH by education. Using multivariable regressions, we assess the associations between educational levels and poor self-rated health. We use these regressions to predict the estimated ratios between the prevalence rates of those in low vs. high education in order to assess if relative changes in poor SRH have narrowed over time. Finally, we tested for statistically significant time trends in adult chronic disease inequalities by education. Results indicate a clear educational gradient in poor SRH. Prevalence ratios show that Brazilian adults with no education have levels of poor SRH that are 7 to 9 times higher than those with some college or more. The difference between those with lowest and highest education increased from 1998 to 2013. Compared to those with no education, there were increases in the prevalence of poor SRH among those with primary and secondary incomplete as well as among those with secondary complete in 2008 and 2013. In conclusion, there is a positive association between poor SRH and low education. Brazil has many social and geographic inequalities in health. Even though educational levels are increasing, there is no improvement in the general subjective health of Brazilians. Health inequalities by race and region highlight the need to improve the health of socially disadvantaged groups in Brazil. Addressing chronic conditions and mental health is needed to improve self-perceptions of health in Brazil as well.</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Increasing educational inequalities in self-rated health in Brazil, 1998-2013</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196494</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Flavia Cristina Drumond Andrade, Jeenal Deepak Mehta&lt;/p&gt;

There is a rapid growing body of knowledge regarding physical aspects of a football match due to studies using computer-assisted motion analysis. The present study used time-motion analysis and triaxial-accelerometers to obtain new insights about differences in physical profiles of elite football players across playing-positions. Player performance data in 23 official home matches from a professional football club, during two seasons were collected for analysis. Eighteen players from five different playing positions (central backs: n = 3; full-backs: n = 5; central midfielders: n = 6; wide midfielders: n = 3; and central forwards: n = 4), performing a total of 138 observations. A novel finding was that central backs and central midfielders had significantly lower work-rate in sprints, decelerations and accelerations than full-backs, wide midfielders and central forwards (p&amp;lt;0.001). Furthermore, wide midfielders and full-backs performed significantly more turns (&gt;90°) than central backs. The most common distance covered in high-intensity runs (≥19.8 km·h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for central backs, central midfielders, wide midfielders and central forwards was 1–5 m, but for full-backs was 6–10 m. This may help coaches in developing individualized training programs to meet the demands of each position in match-play.</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Position specific player load during match-play in a professional football club</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198115</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Baptista, Dag Johansen, André Seabra, Svein Arne Pettersen&lt;/p&gt;

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited retinal degenerative disease, is characterized by a progressive loss of rod photoreceptors followed by loss of cone photoreceptors. Previously, when tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), a key extracellular matrix (ECM) regulator that binds to and inhibits activation of Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) was intravitreal injected into eyes of a transgenic rhodopsin rat model of RP, S334ter-line3, we discovered cone outer segments are partially protected. In parallel, we reported that a specific MMP9 and MMP2 inhibitor, SB-3CT, interferes with mechanisms leading to rod photoreceptor cell death in an MMP9 dependent manner. Here, we extend our initial rat studies to examine the potential of TIMP1 as a treatment in retinal degeneration by investigating neuroprotective effects in a classic mouse retinal degeneration model, &lt;i&gt;rd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Pde6b-/-&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt;). The results clearly demonstrate that intravitreal injections of TIMP1 produce extended protection to delay rod photoreceptor cell death. The mean total number of rods in whole-mount retinas was significantly greater in TIMP-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P35 (P&amp;lt;0.0001) and P45 (P&amp;lt;0.05) than in saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas. In contrast, SB-3CT did not delay rod cell death, leading us to further investigate alternative pathways that do not involve MMPs. In addition to inducing phosphorylated ERK1/2, TIMP1 significantly reduces BAX activity and delays attenuation of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Physiological responses using scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) reveal b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated retinas are significantly greater than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). In later degenerative stages of &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas, photopic b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas are significantly larger than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05).

These results suggest an intertwined molecular signaling network that affects biological time across multiple temporal scales in response to environmental stimuli and available resources.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/07/315788</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315788v1?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26184-z/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26184_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>343</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163728c07ed:5098e79:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26184-z</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26184-z</link><author><name>Chuang Li</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Selective equal spin Andreev reflection at vortex core center in magnetic semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selective equal spin Andreev reflection at vortex core center in magnetic semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure, Published online: 18 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26184-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26184-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Selective equal spin Andreev reflection at vortex core center in magnetic semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/FJDS9TN9vNc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526635169773</crawled><published>1526626800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Selective equal spin Andreev reflection at vortex core center in magnetic semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/FJDS9TN9vNc/s41598-018-26184-z</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Selective equal spin Andreev reflection at vortex core center in magnetic semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selective equal spin Andreev reflection at vortex core center in magnetic semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure, Published online: 18 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26184-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26184-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Selective equal spin Andreev reflection at vortex core center in magnetic semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/FJDS9TN9vNc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>8993d857</fingerprint><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26184-z</href></item></canonical></item><item><engagement>7</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/21.cover-source.jpg?itok=3_ebjn-v</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>359</width></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16388d6a7d9:6ccef6b:3dd877af</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5309.short?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>698950b5</fingerprint><author><name>James Hartle</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Stephen Hawking overcame the limitations of a debilitating disease to make major contributions to science.

Genus &lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus&lt;/i&gt; has a wide distribution in North Africa and in the Middle East. In the present study, we modeled the habitat suitability of two Omani species of the genus (&lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt;) to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on their distribution. Mean diurnal range and precipitation of wettest quarter are the most highly contributed variables for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The potential distribution for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt; in the current time covers the southern coastal regions of Oman, Yemen, the Horn of Africa, and Socotra Island, but the suitable regions were reduced in the future prediction and limited to Yemen, Socotra Island, and Oman. There have not been any records of the species outside of Oman. Analysis of habitat suitability for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt; indicated that the species is restricted to the Al Hajar Mountain of Oman and the southeast coastal region of Iran, but there are no records of the species from Iran. Because mean diurnal range will not be influenced by climate change in future, the potential distribution of the species is not expected to be changed in 2050. All predicted models were performed with the highest AUC (more than 0.97) using the Maxent method. Investigation to find unknown populations of these two species in Iran, Yemen, and Socotra Island is essential for developing conservation programs in the future.</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><published>1527714000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Effects of climate change on niche shifts of &amp;lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus dhofarensis&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus jensvindumi&amp;lt;/i&gt; (Reptilia: Agamidae) in Western Asia</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197884</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>1543c774</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Iman Rounaghi, Seyyed Saeed Hosseinian Yousefkhani&lt;/p&gt;

We propose that this dependence of the strength of the drug on the initial state of activation of the pathway may be affecting the outcome and the reproducibility of drug studies and clinical trials.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/30/153981</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/153981v2?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>217</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05278-8/d41586-018-05278-8_15799042.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163afb413d3:2543871:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05278-8</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05278-8</link><author><name>David Cyranoski</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Reprogrammed’ stem cells approved to mend human hearts for the first time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Reprogrammed’ stem cells approved to mend human hearts for the first time, Published online: 29 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05278-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05278-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The latest clinical use of induced pluripotent stem cells excites researchers, but some fear the therapy will be rushed to market.</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527661204435</crawled><published>1527577200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>‘Reprogrammed’ stem cells approved to mend human hearts for the first time</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05278-8</href></item></alternate><engagementRate>9.04</engagementRate><fingerprint>14bc9a61</fingerprint><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Reprogrammed’ stem cells approved to mend human hearts for the first time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Reprogrammed’ stem cells approved to mend human hearts for the first time, Published online: 29 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05278-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05278-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The latest clinical use of induced pluripotent stem cells excites researchers, but some fear the therapy will be rushed to market.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636a846875:42b39a2:3dd877af</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323964v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>da9bf896</fingerprint><author><name>Li, A.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Most chemicals in commerce have not been evaluated for their carcinogenic potential.

Background &lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) urgently requires effective treatment. Bleomycin-induced lung injury models are characterized by initial inflammation and secondary fibrosis, consistent with the pathological features of IPF. Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) exhibit good differentiation potential and paracrine activity and are thus ideal for cell-based clinical therapies. The therapeutic effects of hAECs on lung fibrosis are attributed to many factors. We performed a systematic review of preclinical studies investigating the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis with hAECs to provide suggestions for their clinical use.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;PubMed and EMBASE were searched for original studies describing hAEC therapy in animal bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis models. After quality assessments, the number and species of experimental animals, bleomycin dose, hAEC source and dosage, time and route of administration of transplanted cells in animals, and time animals were euthanized in nine controlled preclinical studies were summarized. Ashcroft scores, lung collagen contents, inflammatory cells and cytokines were quantitatively and/or qualitatively analyzed in this review. Publication bias was also assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Each of the nine preclinical studies have unique characteristics regarding hAEC use. Ashcroft scores and lung collagen contents were decreased following hAEC transplantation in bleomycin-injured mice. Histopathology was also improved in most studies following treatment with hAECs. hAECs modulated macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, dendritic cells and the mRNA or protein levels of cytokines associated with inflammatory reactions (tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, interferon-γ and interleukin) in lung tissues of bleomycin-injured mice.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;hAECs alleviate and reverse the progression of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice and may represent a new clinical treatment for IPF. hAECs exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects by modulating macrophage, neutrophil, T cell, dendritic cell and related cytokine levels in mice with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.

It was later confirmed by STEM and EDS that Se nanoparticles were absent in control cells and present in cells expressing GRLMR. Structural analysis suggests the lack of a sulfur residue in the substrate/product binding pocket may be responsible for this unique substrate specificity.</description><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Metalloid_Reductase_of_Pseudomonas_Moravenis_Stanleyae_Conveys_Nanoparticle_Mediated_Metalloid_Tolerance/6267383</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/20.cover-source.jpg?itok=tq2Qj6AB</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>359</width></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16364ca7c57:39f3a35:93d646dc</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4710.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4710</canonicalUrl><author><name>Kaho Mabuchi, Hiromasa Maki, Tomotaka Itaya, Takamasa Suzuki, Mika Nomoto, Satomi Sakaoka, Atsushi Morikami, Tetsuya Higashiyama, Yasuomi Tada, Wolfgang Busch, Hironaka Tsukagoshi</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to be important signal molecules that are involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses as well as in growth regulation.

In long-term potentiation (LTP), one of the most studied types of neural plasticity, synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to stimulation. Although a number of different proteins have been implicated in the sub-cellular molecular processes underlying induction and maintenance of LTP, the precise mechanisms remain unknown. A particular challenge is to demonstrate that a proposed molecular mechanism can provide the level of stability needed to maintain memories for months or longer, in spite of the fact that many of the participating molecules have much shorter life spans. Here we present a computational model that combines simulations of several biochemical reactions that have been suggested in the LTP literature and show that the resulting system does exhibit the required stability. At the core of the model are two interlinked feedback loops of molecular reactions, one involving the atypical protein kinase PKMζ and its messenger RNA, the other involving PKMζ and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors. We demonstrate that robust bistability–stable equilibria both in the synapse’s potentiated and unpotentiated states–can arise from a set of simple molecular reactions. The model is able to account for a wide range of empirical results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory reconsolidation and the effects of different pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0_PVuKNJRBs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1527627600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527615681306</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0_PVuKNJRBs/article</href></item></alternate><published>1527627600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Coupled feedback loops maintain synaptic long-term potentiation: A computational model of PKMzeta synthesis and AMPA receptor trafficking</title><recrawled>1527615723856</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Helfer, Thomas R.

We have implemented this grammar as a Bioconductor/R package called &lt;tt&gt;plyranges&lt;/tt&gt;.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/23/327841</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327841v1?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26391-8/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26391_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>324</width></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16396969152:286e4c:7cfe07d6</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26391-8</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26391-8</link><author><name>Merilin Rosenberg</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rapid &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; assessment of Cu-ion mediated effects and antibacterial efficacy of copper surfaces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid &amp;lt;i&gt;in situ&amp;lt;/i&gt; assessment of Cu-ion mediated effects and antibacterial efficacy of copper surfaces, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26391-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26391-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rapid &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; assessment of Cu-ion mediated effects and antibacterial efficacy of copper surfaces&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/IgWmojOT3Kw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527239840082</crawled><published>1527231600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Rapid in situ assessment of Cu-ion mediated effects and antibacterial efficacy of copper surfaces</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/IgWmojOT3Kw/s41598-018-26391-8</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rapid &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; assessment of Cu-ion mediated effects and antibacterial efficacy of copper surfaces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid &amp;lt;i&gt;in situ&amp;lt;/i&gt; assessment of Cu-ion mediated effects and antibacterial efficacy of copper surfaces, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26391-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26391-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rapid &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; assessment of Cu-ion mediated effects and antibacterial efficacy of copper surfaces&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/IgWmojOT3Kw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>93e56c0f</fingerprint><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26391-8</href></item></canonical></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16388d6a7d9:6ccef9f:3dd877af</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/E4751.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/E4751</canonicalUrl><author><name>Sabyasachi Dasgupta, Kapish Gupta, Yue Zhang, Virgile Viasnoff, Jacques Prost</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>We model the dynamics of formation of intercellular secretory lumens.

Widening the genetic basis of leaf rust resistance is a primary objective of the global durum wheat breeding effort at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Breeding programs in North America are following suit, especially after the emergence of new races of &lt;i&gt;Puccinia triticina&lt;/i&gt; such as BBG/BP and BBBQD in Mexico and the United States, respectively. This study was conducted to characterize and map previously undescribed genes for leaf rust resistance in durum wheat and to develop reliable molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding. Four recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations derived from the resistance sources Amria, Byblos, Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, which were crossed to the susceptible line ATRED #2, were evaluated for their reaction to the Mexican race BBG/BP of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;triticina&lt;/i&gt;. Genetic analyses of host reactions indicated that leaf rust resistance in these genotypes was based on major seedling resistance genes. Allelism tests among resistant parents supported that Amria and Byblos carried allelic or closely linked genes. The resistance in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 also appeared to be allelic. Bulked segregant analysis using the Infinium iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array identified two genomic regions for leaf rust resistance; one on chromosome 6BS for Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 and the other on chromosome 7BL for Amria and Byblos. Polymorphic SNPs identified within these regions were converted to kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays and used to genotype the RIL populations. KASP markers &lt;i&gt;usw215&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usw218&lt;/i&gt; were the closest to the resistance genes in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, while &lt;i&gt;usw260&lt;/i&gt; was closely linked to the resistance genes in Amria and Byblos. DNA sequences associated with these SNP markers were anchored to the wild emmer wheat (WEW) reference sequence, which identified several candidate resistance genes. The molecular markers reported herein will be useful to effectively pyramid these resistance genes with other previously marked genes into adapted, elite durum wheat genotypes.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Characterization and mapping of leaf rust resistance in four durum wheat cultivars</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197317</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dhouha Kthiri, Alexander Loladze, P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an important biomarker for patients with cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. It is also known that BNP levels are relatively higher in patients with chronic kidney disease and no heart disease; however, the mechanism remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We developed a BNP reporter mouse and occasionally found that this promoter was activated specifically in the papillary tip of the kidneys, and its activation was not accompanied by &lt;i&gt;BNP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression. No evidence was found to support the existence of BNP isoforms or other nucleotide expression apart from BNP and tdTomato. The pBNP-tdTomato-positive cells were interstitial cells and were not proliferative. Unexpectedly, both the expression and secretion of BNP increased in primary cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes after their treatment with an extract of the renal papillary tip. Intraperitoneal injection of the extract of the papillary tips reduced blood pressure from 210 mmHg to 165 mmHg, the decrease being accompanied by an increase in serum BNP and urinary cGMP production in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHR-SP) rats. Furthermore the induction of BNP by the papillary extract from rats with heart failure due to myocardial infarction was increased in cardiomyocytes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results suggested that the papillary tip express a substance that can stimulate BNP production and secretion from cardiomyocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><published>1525726800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Renal papillary tip extract stimulates BNP production and excretion from cardiomyocytes</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197078</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Itaru Goto, Ryuji Okamoto, Ryotaro Hashizume, Noboru Suzuki, Rie Ito, Keiichi Yamanaka, Hiromitsu Saito, Hiroshi Kiyonari, Isao Tawara, Yuki Kageyama, Yoshito Ogihara, Yusuf Ali, Norikazu Yamada, Naoyuki Katayama, Masaaki Ito&lt;/p&gt;

Furthermore the induction of BNP by the papillary extract from rats with heart failure due to myocardial infarction was increased in cardiomyocytes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results suggested that the papillary tip express a substance that can stimulate BNP production and secretion from cardiomyocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>c1696b10</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197078</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f232e:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197663</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197663</canonicalUrl><author><name>Tsuyoshi Okura</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tsuyoshi Okura, Risa Nakamura, Yohei Fujioka, Sonoko Kawamoto-Kitao, Yuichi Ito, Kazuhisa Matsumoto, Kyoko Shoji, Keisuke Sumi, Kazuhiko Matsuzawa, Shoichiro Izawa, Etsuko Ueta, Masahiko Kato, Takeshi Imamura, Shin-ichi Taniguchi, Kazuhiro Yamamoto&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Increased hepatic insulin clearance (HIC) is important in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study is to analyze an effective insulin resistance (IR) index that is minimally affected by HIC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Our study involved 20 participants with T2DM and 21 healthy participants without diabetes (Non-DM). Participants underwent a meal tolerance test from which plasma glucose, insulin and serum C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) were measured, and HOMA-IR and HIC were calculated. Participants then underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp from which the glucose disposal rate (GDR) was measured.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The index CPR-IR = 20/(fasting CPR × fasting plasma glucose) was correlated more strongly with GDR, than was HOMA-IR, and CPR-IR could be used to estimate GDR. In T2DM participants with HIC below the median, HOMA-IR and CPR-IR were equally well correlated with GDR. In T2DM with high HIC, CPR-IR correlated with GDR while HOMA-IR did not. In Non-DM, CPR-IR and HOMA-IR were equally well correlated with GDR regardless of HIC. The mean HIC value in T2DM was significantly higher than that of Non-DM.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CPR-IR could be a simple and effective index of insulin resistance for patients with type 2 diabetes that is minimally affected by HIC.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><published>1527109200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>CPR-IR is an insulin resistance index that is minimally affected by hepatic insulin clearance—A preliminary research</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197663</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tsuyoshi Okura, Risa Nakamura, Yohei Fujioka, Sonoko Kawamoto-Kitao, Yuichi Ito, Kazuhisa Matsumoto, Kyoko Shoji, Keisuke Sumi, Kazuhiko Matsuzawa, Shoichiro Izawa, Etsuko Ueta, Masahiko Kato, Takeshi Imamura, Shin-ichi Taniguchi, Kazuhiro Yamamoto&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of xenobiotic mixtures containing persistent organic pollutants isolated from commercial fish oil samples against sex hormone receptors, including estrogen and androgen. The applied bioassay was based on transgenic yeast strains. The mixtures were extracted from the samples using the semi-permeable membrane dialysis technique and analyzed with gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry. It turned out that mixtures of chemicals isolated from fish oil may interact with human steroid sex hormone receptors in various ways: the tested samples showed both estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity. Calculated 17β-estradiol equivalents for the tested samples ranged between 0.003 and 0.073 pg g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat). Anti-androgenic activity expressed as the flutamide equivalent concentration was in the 18.58–216.21 ng g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat) range.

The response of genes to changes in [TF] is encoded by sequences outside of the promoter, and this effect can either insulate or amplify the effects of aneuploidy and misregulation on organismal fitness.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/04/215186</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215186v3?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>15</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_1633b37c91c:2a60620:5785ab88</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0015-9</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0015-9</link><author><name>Karine Clément</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MC4R agonism promotes durable weight loss in patients with leptin receptor deficiency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MC4R agonism promotes durable weight loss in patients with leptin receptor deficiency, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0015-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0015-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Treatment with setmelanotide, a new-generation MC4R agonist, provides durable weight loss in hyperphagic, leptin receptor–deficient patients, suggesting a pharmacological avenue to treat patients with various MC4R pathway defects.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/t6CxhqIPE5s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525706901788</crawled><published>1525676400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>MC4R agonism promotes durable weight loss in patients with leptin receptor deficiency</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/t6CxhqIPE5s/s41591-018-0015-9</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MC4R agonism promotes durable weight loss in patients with leptin receptor deficiency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MC4R agonism promotes durable weight loss in patients with leptin receptor deficiency, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0015-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0015-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Treatment with setmelanotide, a new-generation MC4R agonist, provides durable weight loss in hyperphagic, leptin receptor–deficient patients, suggesting a pharmacological avenue to treat patients with various MC4R pathway defects.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/t6CxhqIPE5s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>e0daaf10</fingerprint><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0015-9</href></item></canonical></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395dc:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/697?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>4fa42ee3</fingerprint><author><name>Cho, A.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><published>1526578752000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Neutron stars&apos; quark matter not so strange</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/697.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/697?rss=1</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Physics</item></keywords><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/697?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4d:fc1f8953</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196507</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196507</canonicalUrl><author><name>Hsueh-wen Chow</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hsueh-wen Chow, Chia-Hua Ho&lt;/p&gt;
Despite the rapid worldwide expansion of parks with outdoor fitness equipment (OFE), no objective data regarding the intensity of activity associated with using OFE are available. Hence, this study quantified the energy expenditure and intensity of physical activity by examining four outdoor fitness devices widely used by older adults and provides objective evidence-based intensity references for the Compendium of Physical Activities. Sixteen older adults (mean age: 70.7 ± 5.6 yr) equipped with a portable metabolic system for measuring energy expenditure and activity intensity completed tasks while walking or using four types of OFE. Descriptive statistics and repeated-measures ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc test were employed. The energy expenditure and activity intensity for using an air walker at tempos of 80, 100, and 120 bpm were 50.78 ± 14.76 (2.81 ± 0.85), 59.62 ± 14.23 (3.26 ± 0.82), and 65.62 ± 18.27 (3.55 ± 1.02) cal/kg/min (METs), respectively. The induced energy and intensity output values for a ski machine were 54.00 ± 14.31 (3.02 ± 0.87), 68.87 ± 22.74 (3.82 ± 1.35), and 74.55 ± 23.39 (4.05 ± 1.35) cal/kg/min (METs), at 80, 100, and 120 bpm, respectively. The energy output for a waist twister at 60 bpm was 38.43 ± 20.16 cal/kg/min (2.05 ± 1.15 METs), and that for a double arm stretch at 80 bpm was 31.05 ± 12.58 cal/kg/min (1.63 ± 0.70 METs). These findings indicate that activity on the ski machine and air walker could be considered to have moderate intensity, whereas the intensity of activity on the waist twister and double arm stretch was significantly lower than that for walking at either 3.2 km/h or 4 km/h and could be considered only light intensity. The MET values for the OFE were lower than those for similar indoor fitness equipment. The results of this study provide crucial implications for public health practices concerning the development of active living environments.</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Does the use of outdoor fitness equipment by older adults qualify as moderate to vigorous physical activity?</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196507</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hsueh-wen Chow, Chia-Hua Ho&lt;/p&gt;

The protozoan &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; sp. cause diseases in humans and animals. Studies of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;brucei&lt;/i&gt; cell biology have revealed unique features, such as major endocytic events being limited to a single region, and mitochondrial genome segregation mediated via basal bodies. Further understanding of trypanosome cell biology can be facilitated with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Lack of a plasma membrane probe for fixed trypanosomes remains a persistent problem in need of a working solution. Herein, we report protocols developed using mCLING in super-resolution structured illumination fluorescence microscopy (SR-SIM). mCLING comprehensively labels flagellar membranes, including nascent intracellular stages. To extend its usefulness for trypanosome biology we optimized mCLING in combination with organelle-specific antibodies for immunofluorescence of basal bodies or mitochondria. Then in work with live trypanosomes, we demonstrated internalization of mCLING into endocytic stations that overlap with LysoTracker in acidic organelles. Greater detail of the intracellular location of mCLING was obtained with SR-SIM after pulsing trypanosomes with the probe, and allowing continuous uptake of fluorescent concanavalin A (ConA) destined for lysosomes. In most cases, ConA and mCLING vesicles were juxtaposed but not coincident. A video of the complete image stack at the 15 min time point shows zones of mCLING staining surrounding patches of ConA, consistent with persistence of mCLING in membranes of compartments that contain luminal ConA. In summary, these studies establish mCLING as a versatile trypanosome membrane probe compatible with super-resolution microscopy that can be used for detailed analysis of flagellar membrane biogenesis. In addition, mCLING can be used for immunofluorescence in fixed, permeabilized trypanosomes. Its robust staining of the plasma membrane eliminates a need to overlay transmitted light images on fluorescence pictures obtained from widefield, confocal, or super-resolution microscopy.</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><published>1526504400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A fixable probe for visualizing flagella and plasma membranes of the African trypanosome</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197541</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Justin Wiedeman, Kojo Mensa-Wilmot&lt;/p&gt;

Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt;, currently affecting more than 200 million people. Among the various species of this parasite that infect humans, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; is the most common. Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study, we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this, we investigated systemic acute toxicity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice. Treated mice showed no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or histological parameters compared to non-treated animals. Epiisopilosine showed potential as a schistosomicidal drug: it did not cause acute toxicity and it displayed an acceptable safety profile in the animal model.</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><published>1526072400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Epiisopilosine alkaloid has activity against &amp;lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&amp;lt;/i&gt; in mice without acute toxicity</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196667</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria A.

Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study, we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this, we investigated systemic acute toxicity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice. Treated mice showed no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or histological parameters compared to non-treated animals. Epiisopilosine showed potential as a schistosomicidal drug: it did not cause acute toxicity and it displayed an acceptable safety profile in the animal model.</description><fingerprint>d46d434f</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196667</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1631377a8fa:1960575:11c251fd</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/309781v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>21dea53a</fingerprint><author><name>Stanoev, A.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The proto-oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase whose sensitivity to growth factors (GFs) and signal duration determines cellular behavior.

Voltage-gated sodium channel β subunits (encoded by &lt;i&gt;SCN1B&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;SCN4B&lt;/i&gt; genes) have been demonstrated as important multifunctional signaling molecules modulating cellular processes such as cell adhesion and cell migration. In this study, we aimed to explore the expression profiles of &lt;i&gt;SCN4B&lt;/i&gt; in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and its prognostic value in terms of recurrence-free survival (RFS) in classical PTC. In addition, we also examined the potential effect of DNA methylation on its expression. A retrospective study was performed by using data from available large databases, including the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Thyroid Cancer (THCA). Results showed that &lt;i&gt;SCN4B&lt;/i&gt; is downregulated at both RNA and protein level in PTC compared with normal thyroid tissues. Preserved &lt;i&gt;SCN4B&lt;/i&gt; expression was an independent indicator of favorable RFS in patients with classical PTC, no matter as categorical variables (HR: 0.243, 95%CI: 0.107–0.551, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) or as a continuous variable (HR: 0.684, 95%CI: 0.520–0.899, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007). The methylation status of one CpG site (Chr11: 118,022,316–318) in &lt;i&gt;SCN4B&lt;/i&gt; DNA had a moderately negative correlation with &lt;i&gt;SCN4B&lt;/i&gt; expression in all PTC cases (Pearson’s r = -0.48) and in classical PTC cases (Pearson’s r = -0.41). In comparison, &lt;i&gt;SCN4B&lt;/i&gt; DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) were not frequent and might not influence its mRNA expression. In addition, no somatic mutation was found in &lt;i&gt;SCN4B&lt;/i&gt; DNA. Based on these findings, we infer that preserved &lt;i&gt;SCN4B&lt;/i&gt; expression might independently predict favorable RFS in classical PTC.

Infants from an early age have a bias to attend more to faces than non-faces and after 5 months are particularly attentive to fearful faces. We examined the specificity of this “fear bias” in 5-, 7-, and 12-month-old infants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 269) and 36-month-old children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 191) and whether its development is associated with features of the early rearing environment, specifically maternal anxiety and depression symptoms. Attention dwell times were assessed by measuring the latencies of gaze shifts from a stimulus at fixation to a new stimulus in the visual periphery. In infancy, dwell times were shorter for non-face control stimuli vs. happy faces at all ages, and happy vs. fearful, but not angry, faces at 7 and 12 months. At 36 months, dwell times were shorter for non-faces and happy faces compared to fearful and angry faces.

Infants from an early age have a bias to attend more to faces than non-faces and after 5 months are particularly attentive to fearful faces. We examined the specificity of this “fear bias” in 5-, 7-, and 12-month-old infants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 269) and 36-month-old children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 191) and whether its development is associated with features of the early rearing environment, specifically maternal anxiety and depression symptoms. Attention dwell times were assessed by measuring the latencies of gaze shifts from a stimulus at fixation to a new stimulus in the visual periphery. In infancy, dwell times were shorter for non-face control stimuli vs. happy faces at all ages, and happy vs. fearful, but not angry, faces at 7 and 12 months. At 36 months, dwell times were shorter for non-faces and happy faces compared to fearful and angry faces. Individual variations in attention dwell times were not associated with mothers’ self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms at either age. The results suggest that sensitivity to fearful faces precedes a more general bias for threat-alerting stimuli in early development. We did not find evidence that the initial manifestation of these biases is related to moderate variations in maternal depression or anxiety symptoms.</description><fingerprint>8e92d384</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197424</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7f:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197284</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197284</canonicalUrl><author><name>Jing Chen</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Chen, Liantao Liu, Zhanbiao Wang, Hongchun Sun, Yongjiang Zhang, Zhanyuan Lu, Cundong Li&lt;/p&gt;
Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm). In addition, a moderate nitrogen rate (240 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) could increase root growth, especially in the shallow soil layers. The differences observed with the minirhizotron method were clearer than those observed with the soil coring method.</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><published>1526072400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Determining the effects of nitrogen rate on cotton root growth and distribution with soil cores and minirhizotrons</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197284</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Chen, Liantao Liu, Zhanbiao Wang, Hongchun Sun, Yongjiang Zhang, Zhanyuan Lu, Cundong Li&lt;/p&gt;

Studies on this scale provide logistical and analytic challenges starting with the issue of efficiently storing, transmitting, and accessing underlying data. Here we present a binary file format (the BGEN format) that can store both directly-typed and statistically imputed genotype data, and achieves substantial space savings by data compression and the use of an efficient representation for probabilities.

Studies on this scale provide logistical and analytic challenges starting with the issue of efficiently storing, transmitting, and accessing underlying data. Here we present a binary file format (the BGEN format) that can store both directly-typed and statistically imputed genotype data, and achieves substantial space savings by data compression and the use of an efficient representation for probabilities. We investigate the properties of this format using imputed data from the UK BiLEVE study, demonstrating both storage efficiency, and fast data loading performance on the order of hundreds of millions of imputed genotypes per second.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH. Consistently funded interventions included testing, partner services and linkage to care and interventions for men who have sex with men (MSM).

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH. Consistently funded interventions included testing, partner services and linkage to care and interventions for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal allocation shifted when there were differences in transmission category proportions and progress along the HIV care continuum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The robustness of the results suggests that most health departments can use these analyses to guide the investment of CDC HIV prevention funds into strategies to prevent the most new cases of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>681245ca</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197421</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee2:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197115</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197115</canonicalUrl><author><name>María Ángeles Jiménez-Sousa</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by María Ángeles Jiménez-Sousa, Ana Zaida Gómez-Moreno, Daniel Pineda-Tenor, Luz Maria Medrano, Juan José Sánchez-Ruano, Amanda Fernández-Rodríguez, Tomas Artaza-Varasa, José Saura-Montalbán, Sonia Vázquez-Morón, Pablo Ryan, Salvador Resino&lt;/p&gt;
The polymorphisms at the α-chain of the IL-7 receptor (&lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt;) have been related to T-cell homeostasis and development and may contribute to immune system deregulation. In the present study, we analyzed the association between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms and the progression of liver fibrosis in patients infected with HCV. We carried out a retrospective study with a design consisting of repeated measurements in 187 HCV-infected patients, to study the risk prediction of liver fibrosis progression using genetic factors. We genotyped the rs6897932, rs987106 and rs3194051 &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms using the Agena Bioscience’s MassARRAY. Transient elastography was used to measure liver stiffness. The used cut-offs were: &amp;lt;7.1 kPa (F0-F1), 7.1–9.4 kPa (F2; significant fibrosis), 9.5-12.4 kPa (F3; advanced fibrosis), and ≥12.5 kPa (F4; cirrhosis). All HCV genotypes were analyzed. The median of follow-up time was 47.9 months. Baseline liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values did not show significant statistical differences for &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes (p&gt;0.05). In univariate analysis, the rs6897932 T allele had a positive relationship with an increase in LSM (arithmetic mean ratio (AMR) = 1.21 (95%CI = 1.08; 1.36); p = 0.001), progression to advanced fibrosis (F≥3) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.51 (95%CI = 1.29; 4.88); p = 0.006) and progression to cirrhosis (F4) (OR = 2.71 (95%CI = 0.94; 5.03); p = 0.069). In multivariable analysis, the rs6897932 T allele was related to a higher increase of LSM values during follow-up (adjusted AMR = 1.27 (95%CI = 1.13; 1.42); p&amp;lt;0.001) and higher odds of progression to advanced fibrosis [adjusted OR = 4.46 (95%CI = 1.87; 10.62); p = 0.001], and progression to cirrhosis [adjusted OR = 3.92 (95%CI = 1.30; 11.77); p = 0.015]. Regarding &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and rs3194051 polymorphisms, we did not find significant results except for the relationship between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and the increase in LSM values [adjusted OR = 1.12 (95%CI = 1.02; 1.23); p = 0.015]. The &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs6897932 polymorphism seems to be related to increased risk of liver fibrosis progression in HCV-infected patients. Thus, the rs6897932 polymorphism could be related to the physiopathology of CHC and might be used to successfully stratify the risk of CHC progression.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><published>1525899600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The &amp;lt;i&gt;IL7RA&amp;lt;/i&gt; rs6897932 polymorphism is associated with progression of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C: Repeated measurements design</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197115</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by María Ángeles Jiménez-Sousa, Ana Zaida Gómez-Moreno, Daniel Pineda-Tenor, Luz Maria Medrano, Juan José Sánchez-Ruano, Amanda Fernández-Rodríguez, Tomas Artaza-Varasa, José Saura-Montalbán, Sonia Vázquez-Morón, Pablo Ryan, Salvador Resino&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper, we define sepsis as meeting the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria in the presence of the suspicion of infection. In addition to the physiological data, we include white blood cell count (WBC) to develop a model that can signal the future occurrence of sepsis. A random forest classifier was trained to discriminate between sepsis and non-sepsis patients using a total of 108 features extracted from 2-hour moving time-windows. The models were trained on 80% of the patients and were tested on the remaining 20% of the patients, for two observational periods of lengths 3 and 6 hours. Results: The models, respectively, resulted in F1 scores of 75% and 69% half-hour before sepsis onset and 79% and 76% ten minutes before sepsis onset. On average, the models were able to predict sepsis 210 minutes (3.5 hours) before the onset.

Background &lt;p&gt;The weekend effect describes a phenomenon whereby patients admitted to hospitals on weekends are at higher risk of complications compared to those admitted during weekdays.

Potential confounders (e.g. age, ischemia time, MELD score) were comparable. One-year patient and graft survival were similar. Frequencies of rejections, primary-non function or re-transplantation were not different.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates genes in many physiological pathways by binding to enhancer and silencer elements of target genes, where it recruits coregulator proteins that remodel chromatin and regulate the assembly of transcription complexes. The coregulator Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is necessary for glucocorticoid (GC) regulation of one group of GR target genes, is irrelevant for a second group, and inhibits GR binding to a third gene set, thereby blocking their regulation by GC. Gene-specific characteristics that distinguish GR binding regions (GBR) at Hic-5 blocked genes from GBR at other GC-regulated genes are unknown. Here we show genome-wide that blocked GBR generally require CHD9 and BRM for GR occupancy in contrast to GBR that are not blocked by Hic-5. Hic-5 blocked GBR are enriched near Hic-5 blocked GR target genes but not near GR target genes that are not blocked by Hic-5. Furthermore blocked GBR are in a closed conformation prior to Hic-5 depletion, and require Hic-5 depletion and glucocorticoid treatment to create an open conformation necessary for GR occupancy. A transcription factor binding motif characteristic of the ETS family was enriched near blocked GBR and blocked genes but not near non-blocked GBR or non-blocked GR target genes. Thus, we identify specific differences in chromatin conformation, chromatin remodeler requirements, and local DNA sequence motifs that contribute to gene-specific actions of transcription factors and coregulators. These findings shed light on mechanisms that contribute to binding site selection by transcription factors, which vary in a cell type-specific manner.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><published>1525813200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Different chromatin and DNA sequence characteristics define glucocorticoid receptor binding sites that are blocked or not blocked by coregulator Hic-5</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196965</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brian H.

The spindle pole body (SPB) plays a central role in spore plasma membrane formation in addition to its recognized role in microtubule organization. During meiosis, a biomembrane called the forespore membrane (FSM) is newly formed at the SPB. Although several SPB proteins essential for the initiation of FSM formation (meiotic SPB components) have been identified, the molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of Dms1 as a component of the SPB. We show that FSM formation does not initiate in &lt;i&gt;dms1Δ&lt;/i&gt; cells. Dms1 protein is constitutively expressed throughout the life cycle and localizes to the SPB and the nuclear envelope. The predicted Dms1 protein has a transmembrane domain, which is required for correct localization at the SPB. Dms1 is essential for the proper localization of three meiotic SPB components, Spo15, Spo2, and Spo13, but these components do not affect localization of Dms1. Collectively, these results suggest that Dms1 anchors these meiotic SPB components to the SPB, thereby facilitating the initiation of FSM formation.</content></content><updated>1527627600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><published>1527627600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The fission yeast SPB component Dms1 is required to initiate forespore membrane formation and maintain meiotic SPB components</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197879</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Touko Niimi, Taro Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

Collectively, these results suggest that Dms1 anchors these meiotic SPB components to the SPB, thereby facilitating the initiation of FSM formation.</description><fingerprint>689267b2</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197879</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163405ce4f5:39c5c1:93d646dc</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029488?af=R</originId><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029488?af=R</link><author><name>Kaihang Shi</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/17&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><crawled>1525793219829</crawled><published>1525667421000</published><unread>True</unread><title>High-density equation of state for a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones solid</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029488?af=R</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>93fd64aa</fingerprint><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2340:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197914</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197914</canonicalUrl><author><name>Pascale Tinguely</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pascale Tinguely, Marius Schwalbe, Torsten Fuss, Dominik P.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To facilitate precise local ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a setting of combined ablation and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), we evaluated accuracy and efficiency of a novel technique for navigated positioning of ablation probes using intrahepatic tumor referencing and electromagnetic (EM) guidance, in a porcine model.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An angiographic wire with integrated EM reference sensor at its tip was inserted via a transarterial femoral access and positioned in the vicinity of artificial liver tumors. The resulting offset distance between the tumor center and the intrahepatic endovascular EM reference was calculated. Subsequently, EM tracked ablation probes were inserted percutaneously and navigated toward the tumor center, relying on continuous EM guidance via the intrahepatic reference. Targeting accuracy was assessed as the Euclidean distance between the tip of the ablation probe and the tumor center (Target Positioning Error, TPE). Procedural efficiency was assessed as time efforts for tumor referencing and tumor targeting.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In 6 animals, 124 targeting measurements were performed with an offset distance &amp;lt; 30 mm (clinically most feasible position), resulting in a mean TPE of 2.9 ± 1.6 mm. No significant correlation between the TPE and different intrahepatic offset distances (range 21 to 61 mm, n = 365) was shown as long as the EM reference was placed within the liver. However, the mean TPE increased when placing the EM reference externally on the animal skin (p &amp;lt; 0.01). TPE was similar when targeting under continuous ventilation or in apnea (p = 0.50). Mean time for tumor referencing and navigated targeting was 6.5 ± 3.8 minutes and 14 ± 8 seconds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The proposed technique allows precise and efficient navigated positioning of ablation probes into liver tumors in the animal model.

Fitness is determined by the ability of an organism to both survive and reproduce; however, the mechanisms that lead to increased survival may not have the same effect on reproductive success. We used nineteen natural &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; genotypes from the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Genetic Reference Panel to determine if adaptive plasticity following short-term acclimation through rapid cold-hardening (RCH) affects mating behavior and mating success. We confirmed that exposure to the acclimation temperature is beneficial to survival following cold stress; however, we found that this same acclimation temperature exposure led to less efficient male courtship and a significant decrease in the likelihood of mating. Cold tolerance and the capacity to respond plastically to cold stress were not correlated with mating behavior following acclimation, suggesting that the genetic control of the physiological effects of the cold temperature exposure likely differ between survival and behavioral responses. We also tested whether the exposure of males to the acclimation temperature influenced courtship song. This exposure again significantly increased courtship duration; however, courtship song was unchanged. These results illustrate costs of short-term acclimation on survival and reproductive components of fitness and demonstrate the pronounced effect that short-term thermal environment shifts can have on reproductive success.</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><published>1527109200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Costs of cold acclimation on survival and reproductive behavior in &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197822</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth R.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is relatively high in the southern regions of China. Yunnan, located in southwestern China, has the highest number of ethnic groups. However, HEV infection in the ethnic population is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the seropositive rate, risk factor, and clinical impact of HEV infection in the ethnic groups of Yunnan. We recruited 1912 individuals from four minority groups in three prefectures of Yunnan province. Epidemiological records on potential risk factors for exposure to HEV and blood biochemical index were analyzed. All the serum samples were tested for anti-HEV IgM/IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the IgM-positive samples were subjected to nested reverse transcription-PCR to detect HEV RNA. Overall, 1273 individuals (66.58%) were positive for anti-HEV IgG, 16 (0.84%) for anti-HEV IgM, and 64 (3.35%) for anti-HEV IgG and IgM both; none of them had detectable HEV RNA. Multivariate analysis revealed a strong statistical association between ethnic origin and HEV IgG seroprevalence. Anti-HEV IgG reactivity in the Hani ethnic (82.3%; 401/487) population was higher than that in the Naxi (71.9%, 340/473), Bulang (65.1%; 302/464), and Wa (60.2%; 294/488) ethnic populations (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Older age and male sex were independently associated with the risk of past HEV infection. Moreover, anti-HEV IgG-positive individuals showed significantly higher levels of total and direct bilirubin and alanine amino transferase but significantly lower levels of globulin and low-density lipoprotein, than the respective levels in anti-HEV IgG-negative individuals. Thus, the seroprevalence of HEV infection is high in the ethnic populations of Yunnan, China. It is therefore necessary to increase the surveillance of specific risk groups and raise awareness about the possible infectious diseases to help limit the HEV transmission here.</content></content><updated>1527022800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><published>1527022800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>High seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus in the ethnic minority populations in Yunnan, China</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197577</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yue Feng, Yue-Mei Feng, Songmei Wang, Fang Xu, Xuehui Zhang, Chunyue Zhang, Yuanyuan Jia, Wanru Yang, Xueshan Xia, Jianzhong Yin&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding what determines species’ geographic distributions is crucial for assessing global change threats to biodiversity. Measuring limits on distributions is usually, and necessarily, done with data at large geographic extents and coarse spatial resolution. However, survival of individuals is determined by processes that happen at small spatial scales. The relative abundance of coexisting species (i.e. ‘community structure’) reflects assembly processes occurring at small scales, and are often available for relatively extensive areas, so could be useful for explaining species distributions. We demonstrate that Bayesian Network Inference (BNI) can overcome several challenges to including community structure into studies of species distributions, despite having been little used to date. We hypothesized that the relative abundance of coexisting species can improve predictions of species distributions. In 1570 assemblages of 68 Mediterranean woody plant species we used BNI to incorporate community structure into Species Distribution Models (SDMs), alongside environmental information. Information on species associations improved SDM predictions of community structure and species distributions moderately, though for some habitat specialists the deviance explained increased by up to 15%. We demonstrate that most species associations (95%) were positive and occurred between species with ecologically similar traits. This suggests that SDM improvement could be because species co-occurrences are a proxy for local ecological processes. Our study shows that Bayesian Networks, when interpreted carefully, can be used to include local conditions into measurements of species’ large-scale distributions, and this information can improve the predictions of species distributions.</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><published>1527109200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Community structure informs species geographic distributions</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197877</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alicia Montesinos-Navarro, Alba Estrada, Xavier Font, Miguel G.

Haploinsufficiency, a dominant phenotype caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation, has been rarely observed. However, high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping of yeast morphological characteristics revealed haploinsufficiency phenotypes for more than half of 1,112 essential genes under optimal growth conditions. Additionally, 40% of the essential genes with no obvious phenotype under optimal growth conditions displayed haploinsufficiency under severe growth conditions. Haploinsufficiency was detected more frequently in essential genes than in nonessential genes. Similar haploinsufficiency phenotypes were observed mostly in mutants with heterozygous deletion of functionally related genes, suggesting that haploinsufficiency phenotypes were caused by functional defects of the genes. A global view of the gene network was presented based on the similarities of the haploinsufficiency phenotypes. Our dataset contains rich information regarding essential gene functions, providing evidence that single-cell phenotyping is a powerful approach, even in the heterozygous condition, for analyzing complex biological systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/T_6m60ob9nc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526492659509</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/T_6m60ob9nc/article</href></item></alternate><published>1526504400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>High-dimensional single-cell phenotyping reveals extensive haploinsufficiency</title><recrawled>1526493065517</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shinsuke Ohnuki, Yoshikazu Ohya&lt;/p&gt;

Wild bees are essential pollinators whose survival partly depends on the capacity of their environment to offer a sufficient amount of nectar and pollen. Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a generalist mining bee, &lt;i&gt;Andrena cineraria&lt;/i&gt;, that forages and reproduces during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; was explained by the interaction between flower density in the grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators. Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed rape resources.</content></content><updated>1527022800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><published>1527022800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Current and previous spatial distributions of oilseed rape fields influence the abundance and the body size of a solitary wild bee, &amp;lt;i&gt;Andrena cineraria&amp;lt;/i&gt;, in permanent grasslands</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197684</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Colin Van Reeth, Gaël Caro, Christian Bockstaller, Nadia Michel&lt;/p&gt;

Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators. Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed rape resources.</description><fingerprint>6a8112f</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197684</link></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33b84:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/504-f?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/504.6.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Szuromi, P.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><published>1525369184000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Metallacycles in carbon supports</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/504-f?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>f825c035</fingerprint><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/504-f?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/18.cover-source.jpg?itok=V2AnzLfA</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>359</width></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1631d51f359:2877c9a:fc1f8953</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/E4304.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/E4304</canonicalUrl><author><name>Jae Yong Ryu, Hyun Uk Kim, Sang Yup Lee</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Drug interactions, including drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and drug–food constituent interactions (DFIs), can trigger unexpected pharmacological effects, including adverse drug events (ADEs), with causal mechanisms often unknown.

Thirty-eight percent of US adult women are obese, meaning that more children are now born of overweight and obese mothers, leading to an increase in predisposition to several adult onset diseases. To explore this phenomenon, we developed a maternal obesity animal model by feeding mice a diet composed of high fat/ high sugar (HF/HS) and assessed both maternal diet and offspring diet on the development of endometrial cancer (ECa). We show that maternal diet by itself did not lead to ECa initiation in wildtype offspring of the C57Bl/6J mouse strain. While offspring fed a HF/HS post-weaning diet resulted in poor metabolic health and decreased uterine weight (regardless of maternal diet), it did not lead to ECa. We also investigated the effects of the maternal obesogenic diet on ECa development in a Diethylstilbestrol (DES) carcinogenesis mouse model. All mice injected with DES had reproductive tract lesions including decreased number of glands, condensed and hyalinized endometrial stroma, and fibrosis and increased collagen deposition that in some mice extended into the myometrium resulting in extensive disruption and loss of the inner and outer muscular layers. Fifty percent of DES mice that were exposed to maternal HF/HS diet developed several features indicative of the initial stages of carcinogenesis including focal glandular and atypical endometrial hyperplasia versus 0% of their Chow counterparts. There was an increase in phospho-Akt expression in DES mice exposed to maternal HF/HS diet, a regulator of persistent proliferation in the endometrium, and no difference in total Akt, phospho-PTEN and total PTEN expression. In summary, maternal HF/HS diet exposure induces endometrial hyperplasia and other precancerous phenotypes in mice treated with DES. This study suggests that maternal obesity alone is not sufficient for the development of ECa, but has an additive effect in the presence of a secondary insult such as DES.</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><published>1526677200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Maternal obesogenic diet induces endometrial hyperplasia, an early hallmark of endometrial cancer, in a diethylstilbestrol mouse model</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0186390</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Theresa O.

If you live in the US, you’ve surely seen various cancer treatment centers talking about their personalized therapy plans, and especially how they’ll tailor things to your DNA sequence and so on. You would get the impression that we have an arsenal of specifically targeted cancer therapies, waiting for patients to get their tumors sequenced so they can be paired with the optimal treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not true. I wish it were, but it just isn’t. And I fear that a lot of patients and their families actually believe that it is, which can make for some bad decisions (both medically and financially). I can hardly blame them much, though, because for years now there’s been a ceaseless flow of stories in the press about targeted therapies, genomic sequencing of patients, breakthroughs, advances, new DNA this and advanced sequence that and on and on. I think it’s safe to say that the average patient does not have the time nor the expertise to keep up with the actual biomedical literature, and thus relies on headlines and advertisements for an impression of the field, and that impression is pretty far off of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; article, which covers a debate at the recent AACR meeting between David Hyman and Vinay Prasad, estimates that only about 15% of patients total are currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/precision-medicine/tumor-dna-sequencing&quot;&gt;even eligible&lt;/a&gt; (under FDA guidelines) to have their tumors sequenced in hope of matching with a targeted therapy. About one third-of those may actually benefit from the process in the end. This is not exactly what you’d expect if all you knew about this stuff was what you heard on TV. The thing is, that’s actually a great advance, because the number used to be zero, in both categories. We really are making progress, and the people who can benefit really can benefit. It’s just that there aren’t nearly as many of them as we’d like, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can’t pin this just on clueless news readers – even back in 2003, the head of the NCI (later head of the FDA, Andy Eschenbach) &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2012/02/23/remember_when_we_were_going_to_eliminate_deaths_from_cancer&quot;&gt;was talking&lt;/a&gt; about “eliminating death and suffering” due to cancer by. . .2015. We have missed that deadline. In 2006 (as that link shows), he was going on in a similar way about how we’d moved to a whole new level, everything had changed, etc. In general, whenever someone starts talking about “the next level” or something like that, I check to make sure my wallet is still in my pocket. This isn’t a game we’re working through – it doesn’t have “levels”, and in fact, not many large complicated real-world things do. Quantized jumps happen on the microscale. Up here, we’re grinding it out, and that’s how cancer therapy is advancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the confusion is that people have different ideas about what “precision targeting” in oncology really is. The term got applied early on to the wave of kinase inhibitors and so on that targeted particular cellular mechanisms (rather than just being wrecking balls like some of the earlier chemotherapy drugs), and that muddied things a bit. Some of the earlier successes in this area came about because some (relatively rare) tumor types really do seem to be pretty genetically homogeneous: they occur in pretty much the same way for the same reasons. So if you target that mechanism, you’re likely to see an effect; it’s like the situation in many human genetic disorders, and it doesn’t happen that way in cancer too often. But the high-profile successes against things like GIST confused some parts the public, I think, into thinking that the different bodily locations of cancer were all like that – genetically distinct from cancer in other organs, but very similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would that it were so. The second level of confusion comes to the DNA-sequencing aspect, which is at least closer to reality in terms of how cancer works, if not its treatment. “OK’, this story goes, “this patient has (something)oma, so let’s take some cells and see what variety of it they have so we can give them the drug that works against that subtype”. That’s what too many people think we have now, and what in a few cases we actually do (as above). But most of the time we don’t really understand what’s going on at a cellular level, as gets proven every time another promising oncology mechanism wipes out in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even with those successes, there’s room to wonder how far this idea can be pushed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/12/precision-oncology-isnt-quite-there-yet&quot;&gt;Here’s a piece on that&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 (more Vinay Prasad), wondering just how precise it’s possible to get. One big problem is that many solid tumors are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/08/16/cancer_cells_too_unstable_for_fine_targeting&quot;&gt;terrible mixture&lt;/a&gt; of cell types. They generally got that way by being &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/20/glioblastoma-is-bad-news-period&quot;&gt;genomically unstable&lt;/a&gt;, and that unstability just goes on and on. That’s where all this fine targeting really runs into trouble: what if a given patient’s tumor is a mixture of eight or nine different cellular forms of cancer? Well, eight or nine that you know about so far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s one reason that immuno-oncology is such a hot field, because (to a first approximation) it’s saying “OK, we don’t know how all you cells became cancerous and we don’t care. We can set it up so that (for example) you all get recognized by killer T cells, and they will take you out no matter what your pedigree”. Problem is, we’re not quite to this stage for all but a very few forms of cancer. By far the most successful are blood-based cancers like leukemia, where the cells really are quite similar to each other by oncology standards, giving you a chance to wipe them out &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;. Getting that to happen for solid tumors is. . .not so easy. The more successful immuno-oncology for solid tumors, so far, is using antibodies to go after potential common mechanisms like PD-L1 that are fending off such T-cell attack, but (a) we don’t have such markers for most solid tumors, and (b) in many cases, the most we can do now, usually, is to wipe out most of of a patient’s tumors (best case) leaving behind an untouched residue of mutated cells that eventually comes back in untreatable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not putting that down at all – this can buy people substantial more life, although not always. In every case, you have to see (with real-world clinical data) how much actual survival you’ve been able to achieve. That’s another big reason that we missed that absurd 2015 date, because it takes years to figure out just how well these therapies actually work in practice. It’s a slog, and I don’t see any way for it not to be a slog, and it’s too bad that that doesn’t make for a very compelling slogan.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>This piece in Science says something that needs to be said louder and more publicly.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Active recovery is often used by athletes after strenuous exercise or competition but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We observed a time × group interaction effect for VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; (p = 0.013). Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026). No significant effects were observed for all other variables.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Active recovery increased aspects of central, rather than muscle recovery. However, no effect on MVC was seen, implying that even if active recovery speeds up CNS recovery, without affecting the recovery of muscle contractile properties, this doesn´t translate into increases in overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><published>1526331600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Active recovery affects the recovery of the corticospinal system but not of muscle contractile properties</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197339</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Louis-Solal Giboin, Ehsan Amiri, Raphael Bertschinger, Markus Gruber&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an attractive approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. AMPK activation reduces glucose levels in animal models of type 2 diabetes by increasing glucose uptake in skeletal muscles and reducing hepatic glucose production. Furthermore, AMPK activation ameliorates hepatic steatosis in animal models. For the clinical development of AMPK activators it is essential to have a reliable target engagement marker for appropriate dose finding and to support proof of clinical principle. While the activation of AMPK by quantification of the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; in target tissues can be assessed pre-clinically, this is not feasible in clinical studies. Therefore, we attempted to identify and translate a peripheral target engagement biomarker downstream of AMPK activation for clinical use in blood samples.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;For pharmacological activation of AMPK, two AMPK activators were synthesized (compound 1 and 2). A compound with structural similarities but no pharmacological effect on AMPK phosphorylation was synthesized as negative control (compound 3). Whole blood from healthy volunteers was incubated with an AMPK activator for up to 6 hours and mRNA sequencing was performed. Additionally, human PBMCs were isolated to evaluate Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in Western blots. In order to enable identification of translatable biomarker candidates, blood samples from HanWistar rats treated for two weeks with an AMPK activator were also subjected to mRNA sequencing. Furthermore, concentration-response curves for four biomarker candidates were recorded in human blood samples using Nanostring nCounter technology. Finally, ZDF rats were treated with increasing doses of compound 2 for five weeks to investigate the glucose-lowering efficacy. To investigate changes of mRNA expression of two selected biomarker candidates in this ZDF rat study, qRT-PCR was performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Pharmacological activation of AMPK in human PBMCs revealed an increase in Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK, confirming target engagement in these blood cells. RNA sequencing of human blood samples identified 608 deregulated genes after AMPK activation. Additionally, AMPK activation led to deregulation of 367 genes in whole blood from HanWistar rats which mapped to the respective human genes. 22 genes out of the intersection of genes deregulated in both species are proposed as potential translatable target engagement biomarker candidates. The most prominent genes were transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB, osteoactivin), calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGLYRP1) and Ras homolog gene family, member B (RHOB). Specificity for AMPK was shown by testing inactive compound 3 in HanWistar rats. The exposure-effect relationship for GPNMB was investigated in a subchronic study in diabetic ZDF rats. GPNMB showed a dose-dependent up-regulation both acutely and after subchronic dosing. GPNMB up-regulation correlated with an increased Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in liver and quadriceps muscle in rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;GPNMB has been identified as a translatable target engagement biomarker for use in clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527282000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><published>1527282000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Discovery and translation of a target engagement marker for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197849</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rolf Grempler, Michael Wolff, Eric Simon, Ramona Schmid, Claudia Eisele, Kathrin Rieber, Elke Fischer, Sonja Mettel, Ogsen Gabrielyan, Denis Delic, Gerd Luippold, Norbert Redeman&lt;/p&gt;

The most prominent genes were transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB, osteoactivin), calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGLYRP1) and Ras homolog gene family, member B (RHOB). Specificity for AMPK was shown by testing inactive compound 3 in HanWistar rats. The exposure-effect relationship for GPNMB was investigated in a subchronic study in diabetic ZDF rats. GPNMB showed a dose-dependent up-regulation both acutely and after subchronic dosing. GPNMB up-regulation correlated with an increased Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in liver and quadriceps muscle in rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;GPNMB has been identified as a translatable target engagement biomarker for use in clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>7d9b7cd3</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197849</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_163ad4688a8:21a1193:2835af05</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5726.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5726</canonicalUrl><author><name>Joseph R.

Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease, with considerable genetic contribution. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified a number of genomic regions for the risk of psoriasis. However, it is challenging to pinpoint the functional causal variants and then further decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying each region. In order to prioritize potential functional causal variants within psoriasis susceptibility regions, we integrated the genetic association findings and functional genomic data publicly available, i.e. histone modifications in relevant immune cells. We characterized a pervasive enrichment pattern of psoriasis variants in five core histone marks across immune cells/tissues. We discovered that genetic alleles within psoriasis association regions might influence gene expression levels through significantly affecting the binding affinities of 17 transcription factors. We established a catalog of 654 potential functional causal variants for psoriasis and suggested that they significantly overlapped with causal variants for autoimmune diseases. We identified potential causal variant rs79824801 overlay with the peaks of five histone marks in primary CD4+ T cells. Its alternative allele affected the binding affinity of transcription factor &lt;i&gt;IKZF1&lt;/i&gt;. This study highlights the complex genetic architecture and complicated mechanisms for psoriasis. The findings will inform the functional experiment design for psoriasis.</content></content><updated>1525208400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><published>1525208400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A catalog of potential putative functional variants in psoriasis genome-wide association regions</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196635</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yan Lin, Lu Liu, Yujun Sheng, Changbing Shen, Xiaodong Zheng, Fusheng Zhou, Sen Yang, Xianyong Yin, Xuejun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

The marine environment in the Gulf of Gabes (southern Tunisia) is severely impacted by phosphate industries. Nowadays, three localities, Sfax, Skhira and Gabes produce phosphoric acid along the coasts of this Gulf and generate a large amount of phosphogypsum as a waste product. The Gabes phosphate industry is the major cause of pollution in the Gulf because most of the waste is directly discharged into the sea without preliminary treatment. This study investigates the marine environment in the proximity of the phosphate industries of Gabes and the coastal marine environment on the eastern coast of Djerba, without phosphate industry. This site can be considered as &amp;quot;pristine&amp;quot; and enables a direct comparison between polluted and “clean” adjacent areas.
Phosphorous, by sequential extractions (SEDEX), Rock-Eval, C, H, N elemental analysis, and stable carbon isotope composition of sedimentary organic matter, X-ray diffraction (qualitative and quantitative analysis) were measured on sediments. Temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen were measured on the water close to the sea floor of each station to estimate environmental conditions. These analyses are coupled with video surveys of the sea floor.

Background &lt;p&gt;Telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL-TL) was proposed as a biomarker of cancer risk. Recent scientific evidence suggested PBL-TL plays a diverse role in different cancers. Inconsistent results were obtained on PBL-TL in relation to breast cancer risk and specifically to the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The aim of the present case-control study was to analyse the correlation between family history of breast cancer or presence of a BRCA mutation and PBL-TL in the hypothesis that TL is a modifier of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;PBL-TL was measured using the real-time quantitative PCR method in DNA for 142 cases and 239 controls. All the women enrolled were characterized for cancer family history. A subgroup of 48 women were classified for the presence of a BRCA mutation. PBL-TL were summarized as means and standard deviations, and compared by standard analysis of variance. A multivariable Generalised Linear Model was fitted to the data with PBL-TL as the dependent variable, case/control status and presence of a BRCA/VUS mutation as factors, and age in 4 strata as a covariate.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Age was significantly associated with decreasing PBL-TL in controls (p = 0.01), but not in BC cases. The telomere length is shorter in cases than in controls after adjusting for age. No effect on PBL-TL of BMI, smoke nor of the most common risk factors for breast cancer was observed. No association between PBL-TL and family history was detected both in BC cases and controls. In the multivariate model, no association was observed between BRCA mutation and decreased PBL-TL. A statistically significant interaction (p = 0.031) between case-control status and a BRCA-mutation/VUS was observed, but no effect was detected for the interaction of cancer status and BRCA or VUS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study fails to provide support to the hypothesis that PBL-TL is associated with the risk of hereditary BC, or that is a marker of inherited mutations in BRCA genes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526936400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><published>1526936400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Leucocytes telomere length and breast cancer risk/ susceptibility: A case-control study</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197522</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Pavanello, Liliana Varesco, Viviana Gismondi, Paolo Bruzzi, Claudia Bolognesi&lt;/p&gt;

Ramie (&lt;i&gt;Boehmeria nivea&lt;/i&gt; L. Gaud) fiber, one of the most important natural fibers, is extracted from stem bark. Continuous cropping is the main obstacle to ramie stem growth and a major cause of reduced yields. Root-associated microbes play crucial roles in plant growth and health. In this study, we investigated differences between microbial communities in the soil of healthy and continuously cropped ramie plants, and sought to identify potential mechanisms whereby these communities could counteract the problems posed by continuous cropping. Paired-end Illumina MiSeq analysis of 16S rRNA and ITS gene amplicons was employed to study bacterial and fungal communities. Long-term monoculture of ramie significantly decreased fiber yields and altered soil microbial communities. Our findings revealed how microbial communities and functional diversity varied according to the planting year and plant health status. Soil bacterial diversity increased with the period of ramie monoculture, whereas no significant differences were observed for fungi. Sequence analyses revealed that &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acidobacteria&lt;/i&gt; were the most abundant bacterial phyla. &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; abundance decreased with the period of ramie monoculture and correlated positively with the stem length, stem diameter, and fiber yield. The &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Chloroflexi&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/i&gt; phyla exhibited a significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) negative correlation with yields during continuous cultivation. Some &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt; members showed reduced microbial diversity, which prevented continuous ramie cropping. &lt;i&gt;Ascomycota&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Basidiomycota&lt;/i&gt; were the main fungal phyla. The relatively high abundance of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; observed in healthy ramie may contribute to disease suppression, thereby promoting ramie growth. In summary, soil weakness and increased disease in ramie plants after long-term continuous cropping can be attributed to changes in soil microbes, a reduction in beneficial microbes, and an accumulation of harmful microbes.</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><published>1526072400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Potential use of high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities for estimating the adverse effects of continuous cropping on ramie (&amp;lt;i&gt;Boehmeria nivea&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.

This is made possible by the uniform exciton energetic landscape created by the well-ordered, crystalline nanofiber core.&lt;/p&gt;</description><keywords><item>Materials Science</item></keywords><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/897?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00315/20180501/images/medium/jm-2018-00315s_0009.gif</url><height>179</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_16322c20cdd:5b44eb:d27a8ff7</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00315</originId><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00315</link><author><name>Cong Li, Xiaobing Deng, Weilin Zhang, Xiaowen Xie, Marcus Conrad, Ying Liu, José Pedro Friedmann Angeli, Luhua Lai</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00315/20180501/images/medium/jm-2018-00315s_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00315&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Since endophytes can affect metabolism of host plants, they are expected to be used to improve crop quality, especially for crops with organoleptic sensitive products such as wine grape. However, details of metabolic interactions between endophytes and host plants were less understood. In this work, we used high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the metabolites of fruit flesh cells of grape treated with dual culture of different endophytic fungal strains (EFS). We observed that the dual-culture with different fungal strains show different metabolites composition in grape cells. In response to different EFS, quantities of detected metabolites in grape cells varied from 6 to 17 in this assay, and 1 to 11 novel metabolites were introduced into metabolome of grape cells. Dual-culture with fungal strains CS2, RH16 and RH5 introduced the highest quantities (10 or 11) of novel metabolites in grape cells. More importantly, the modification of metabolic profiles in grape cells &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; fungal endophytes appeared to be fungal strain/genus-specificity.

Generally, motoneurons and muscles develop simultaneously during embryogenesis.

Fisheries management is most effective when based on scientific estimates of sustainable fishing rates. While some simple approaches allow estimation of harvest limits, more data-intensive stock assessments are generally required to evaluate the stock’s biomass and fishing rates relative to sustainable levels. Here we evaluate how stock characteristics relate to the rate of new assessments in the United States. Using a statistical model based on time-to-event analysis and 569 coastal marine fish and invertebrate stocks landed in commercial fisheries, we quantify the impact of region, habitat, life-history, and economic factors on the annual probability of being assessed. Although the majority of landings come from assessed stocks in all regions, less than half of the regionally-landed species currently have been assessed. As expected, our time-to-event model identified landed tonnage and ex-vessel price as the dominant factors determining increased rates of new assessments. However, we also found that after controlling for landings and price, there has been a consistent bias towards assessing larger-bodied species. A number of vulnerable groups such as rockfishes (Scorpaeniformes) and groundsharks (Carcharhiniformes) have a relatively high annual probability of being assessed after controlling for their relatively small tonnage and low price. Due to relatively low landed tonnage and price of species that are currently unassessed, our model suggests that the number of assessed stocks will increase more slowly in future decades.</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><published>1526072400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Drivers and rates of stock assessments in the United States</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196483</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Neubauer, James T.

Pollen analysis is widely used to verify the geographic origin of honeys, but has never been employed in Australia. In this study, we analysed the pollen content of 173 unblended honey samples sourced from most of the commercial honey producing regions in southern Australia. Southern Australian vegetation is dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; (Myrtaceae) forests and, as expected, most Australian honeys are palynologically dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt;, while other important components include Myrtaceae taxa such as &lt;i&gt;Corymbia&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Angophora&lt;/i&gt; and the tribe Leptospermeae; plus Brassicaceae, &lt;i&gt;Echium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Macadamia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acacia&lt;/i&gt;. An important feature of the honeys is the number of Myrtaceae pollen morphotypes per sample, which is generally high (mean = 4.6) compared to honeys produced outside of Australia, including &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys produced in the Mediterranean region, and honeys produced in South America, which has its own rich indigenous Myrtaceae flora. In the latter regions, the number of Myrtaceae morphotypes is apparently generally ≤2. A high number of Myrtaceae morphotypes may be a feasible criterion for authenticating the origin of Australian honeys, since most Australian honey is produced by honey bees mainly working indigenous floral resources. Myrtaceae morphotype diversity is a convenient melissopalynological measure that could be applied even where detailed knowledge of the pollen morphology of the many component genera and species is absent. Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey.</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526493611198</crawled><published>1526504400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Pollen analysis of Australian honey</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We assessed for the first time whether urinary free light chains (FLC) are independently associated with risk of ESRD in patients with CKD, and whether they offer incremental value in risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We measured urinary FLCs in 556 patients with CKD from a prospective cohort study. The association between urinary kappa/creatinine (KCR) and lambda/creatinine (LCR) ratios and development of ESRD was assessed by competing-risks regression (to account for the competing risk of death). The change in C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement were used to assess the incremental value of adding KCR or LCR to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;136 participants developed ESRD during a median follow-up time of 51 months. Significant associations between KCR and LCR and risk of ESRD became non-significant after adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), although having a KCR or LCR &gt;75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centile remained independently associated with risk of ESRD. Neither KCR nor LCR as continuous or categorical variables provided incremental value when added to the KFRE for estimating risk of ESRD at two years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Urinary FLCs have an association with progression to ESRD in patients with CKD which appears to be explained to a degree by their correlation with eGFR and ACR.

LncRNAs are regulatory noncoding RNAs that play crucial roles in many biological processes. The dysregulation of lncRNA is thought to be involved in many complex diseases; lncRNAs are often the targets of miRNAs in the indirect regulation of gene expression. Numerous studies have indicated that miRNA-lncRNA interactions are closely related to the occurrence and development of cancers. Thus, it is important to develop an effective method for the identification of cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA interactions. In this study, we compiled 155653 experimentally validated and predicted miRNA-lncRNA associations, which we defined as basic interactions. We next constructed an individual-specific miRNA-lncRNA network (ISMLN) for each cancer sample and a basic miRNA-lncRNA network (BMLN) for each type of cancer by examining the expression profiles of miRNAs and lncRNAs in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. We then selected potential miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers based on the BLMN. Using this method, we identified cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers and modules specific to a certain cancer. This method of profiling will contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of cancers at the level of gene regulatory networks.</content></content><updated>1525208400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><published>1525208400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Identification of cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers using a basic miRNA-lncRNA network</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196681</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guangle Zhang, Cong Pian, Zhi Chen, Jin Zhang, Mingmin Xu, Liangyun Zhang, Yuanyuan Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Coral reefs protect islands from tropical storm waves and provide goods and services for millions of islanders worldwide. Yet it is unknown how coral reefs in general, and carbonate production in particular, will respond to sea-level rise and thermal stress associated with climate change. This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether that value varied across habitats. Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs. The value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production became negative varied across habitats, with highest values on inner reefs. These results suggest that some inner reefs tend to produce less carbonate, and therefore need higher coral cover to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise than outer and patch reefs. These results also suggest that inner reefs are more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other habitats, which stresses the need for effective land-use practices as the climate continues to change. Averaging across all reef habitats, the rate of carbonate production was 9.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 7.9 mm y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of potential vertical accretion. Such rates of vertical accretion are higher than projected averages of sea-level rise for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate-change scenarios 2.6, 4.5, and 6, but lower than for the RCP scenario 8.5.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><published>1525813200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Keeping up with sea-level rise: Carbonate production rates in Palau and Yap, western Pacific Ocean</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert van Woesik, Christopher William Cacciapaglia&lt;/p&gt;

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines.

Norris&lt;/p&gt;
The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science.

Global cooperation is urgently needed to prevent risks of world-wide extreme events and disasters for sustainable development. In human societies, however, there exists bias toward interacting with partners with similar characteristics, but not contributing globally. We study how complex interactive behaviors evolve under risks through proposing a threshold public goods game model. In the model, individuals either play games with participants who own the same phenotype, or contribute to the collective target of global public goods. We further introduce an insurance compensation mechanism into the model to probe the evolution of global cooperation. It is found that the introduction of the insurance remarkably promotes the emergence of global cooperative behavior and inhibits the tendency to play games only with individuals of the same phenotype. Besides, contrary to models without insurance, global cooperation is strengthened with the increase of imitation intensities. In addition, high risk and high threshold are in favor of global cooperation.</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><published>1526677200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Insurance optimizes complex interactive and cooperative behaviors in public goods games</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197574</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinming Du&lt;/p&gt;

Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic disease caused by the cestode &lt;i&gt;Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, is a worldwide zoonotic infection. Although endemic in Chile, information on the molecular characteristics of CE in livestock remains scarce.

Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic disease caused by the cestode &lt;i&gt;Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, is a worldwide zoonotic infection. Although endemic in Chile, information on the molecular characteristics of CE in livestock remains scarce.

Background &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) had been reported to be rare. However, recent studies using echocardiography as a screening method showed conflicting results, and the true prevalence is still unclear. Since diagnosing primary SS is difficult because of its heterogeneous nature, a number of patients with primary-SS-associated PAH may be misdiagnosed with idiopathic PAH, losing their chance to undergo immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prevalence of primary SS among patients who initially present with PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From our prospective institutional PAH database, 40 consecutive patients without any obvious cause of PAH at the time of PAH diagnosis were identified. We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of primary SS diagnosed during or after the initial assessment of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the initial assessment, one patient was diagnosed with primary-SS-associated PAH. Among the 25 patients who were initially diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, five were diagnosed with primary SS during their course of the disease. Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation. The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH. Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH. Clinicians should pay specific attention and carefully evaluate the possibility of primary SS in patients with PAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><published>1526418000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Prevalence of primary Sjögren’s syndrome in patients undergoing evaluation for pulmonary arterial hypertension</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197297</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuyuki Sato, Masaru Hatano, Yukiko Iwasaki, Hisataka Maki, Akihito Saito, Shun Minatsuki, Toshiro Inaba, Eisuke Amiya, Keishi Fujio, Masafumi Watanabe, Kazuhiko Yamamoto, Issei Komuro&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Elevated testosterone (T) is routinely reported as a marker of hyperandrogenemia in rodent models for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In women with PCOS, elevated serum androstenedione (A4) is associated with more severe phenotypes, including a positive correlation with serum T, DHEAS, free androgen index (FAI), LH, and LH/FSH ratio. Furthermore, A4, along with calculated free T and FAI, was identified as one of the best predictors of PCOS in adult women of all ages (18 to &gt; 50 y).&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to investigate serum A4 levels in early adolescent and young adult prenatally androgenized (PNA) female rats, a model for PCOS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Pregnant rats were injected with 5 mg T daily during gestational days 16–19 (PNA rats, experimental group) or an equal volume of vehicle (control group). Female offspring of both groups had tail vein blood drawn for serum analysis at 8 and 16 weeks of age. ELISAs were used to quantify serum A4 and T levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Serum A4 and T were elevated in 16-week-old PNA rats compared to controls. There was no significant difference in either hormone at 8 weeks of age.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The PNA rats demonstrated elevated serum A4 and T in young adulthood, as has been observed in women with PCOS, further validating this as a model for PCOS and underscoring the importance of serum A4 elevation as a parameter inherent to PCOS and a rodent model for the disorder.

Interventions to enhance mental health and well-being within high risk industries such as the emergency services have typically focused on individual-level factors, though there is increasing interest in the role of organisational-level interventions. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of different aspects of manager support in determining the mental health of ambulance personnel. A cross-sectional survey was completed by ambulance personnel across two Australian states (N = 1,622). Demographics, manager support and mental health measures were assessed. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to determine the explanatory influence of the employee’s perception of the priority management places upon mental health issues (manager psychosocial safety climate) and managers’ observed behaviours (manager behaviour) on employee common mental disorder and well-being within ambulance personnel. Of the 1,622 participants, 123 (7.6%) were found to be suffering from a likely mental disorder. Manager psychosocial safety climate accounted for a significant amount of the variance in levels of employee common mental health disorder symptoms (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01). Manager behaviour had a lesser, but still statistically significant influence upon symptoms of common mental disorder (7% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (10% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.05). The perceived importance management places on mental health and managers’ actual behaviour are related but distinct concepts, and each appears to impact employee mental health. While the overall variance explained by each factor was limited, the fact that each is potentially modifiable makes this finding important and highlights the significance of organisational and team-level interventions to promote employee well-being within emergency services and other high-risk occupations.</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><published>1527109200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The importance of manager support for the mental health and well-being of ambulance personnel</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197802</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine Petrie, Aimée Gayed, Bridget T.

Thus, our data highlights a pro-longevity role of ATM, for the first time establishing direct causal links between robust DNA repair machinery and longevity, and providing therapeutic strategy for progeria and age-related metabolic diseases.</description><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item></keywords><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34836</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25008-4/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25008_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>571</width></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1632a74c5c2:12f6a40:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25008-4</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25008-4</link><author><name>Emile S.

Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) producing carbapenemases are increasing at an alarming speed. Rapid confirmation of carbapenemase type will be an important diagnostic step in clinical microbiology laboratories not only to reduce the risk of transmissions but also for optimising antibiotic therapy in the future. We compared diagnostic reliability of two commercially available molecular assays (Check-Direct CPE vs. AID line probe assay) for detection and typing of carbapenemase genes in 80 well-characterized isolates of MDR-GNB. Respective strains were isolated in various clinical specimens at our clinical microbiology laboratory. The reference standard included confirmation of carbapenemase-production at the molecular level at the German National Reference Laboratory for Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany). 53 &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and 27 members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex were used in this study.

That was after the Merck/Incyte failure of a combination of Keytruda and Incyte’s IDO (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/77/24/6795&quot;&gt;indole 2,3-dioxygenase&lt;/a&gt;) inhibitor. That mechanism was supposed to increase T-cell activity, but the trial showed it to have no effect on Keytruda’s efficacy at all. Earlier IDO trials had not gone well for other companies, but there had been hopes for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as there were hopes for another inhibitor that Bristol-Myers Squibb had bought from Flexus (which is quite a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/10/16/incyte-and-flexus-the-grappling-continues&quot;&gt;tangled tale&lt;/a&gt; in itself). I wondered at the end of that last post if the Merck/Incyte failure meant that the BMS/Flexus effort was doomed as well – everyone who follows this area was wondering the same thing – but as some readers pointed out, the Flexus inhibitor did have a somewhat different mechanism of action, so there was at least a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scratch that. Yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AndyBiotech/status/990975230322585605&quot;&gt;Andy Biotech&lt;/a&gt; noticed (and posted on Twitter) that the two Phase III trials had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xconomy.com/new-york/2018/04/30/bristol-myers-latest-to-drop-ido-studies-in-wake-of-incyte-failure/&quot;&gt;quietly been scrapped&lt;/a&gt; on clinicaltrials.gov. So I think we can say that (at least as currently configured) the excursion into IDO inhibitors has been a costly mistake. And remember, as is almost always the case in these things, that it didn’t look like it was going to be any such thing. IDO inhibition made sense in terms of what we knew about its biochemical pathway and the workings of T-cells, which is why you saw several companies taking a whack at it (Pfizer was in the area as well, and there are others whose preclinical programs you never even heard about). All in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a great big central problem of drug discovery for you: how do we go into the clinic (but avoid spending Phase III levels of money) to find these things out? Better yet, how do we avoid developing such things in the first place, if they’re going to do this to us? Billions of dollars, literal billions, are stacked up waiting for anyone who can start to begin to do such things. Just to pick on a recent hyped-up press release, could BenevolentAI’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/23/benevolentai-worth-two-billion&quot;&gt;machine brain&lt;/a&gt;” have warned people off? Would anyone have believed them if they had? (I doubt that very much, for both questions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the problem is that we’re doing things that no one has tried to do before, and we’re doing them on what is clearly incomplete information. And the only way to make it more complete is to. . .go ahead and do those things,apparently, and at great cost. Could you have warned everyone, in convincing fashion, not to chase IDO inhibitors? &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/11/06/cb1_obesity_drugs_farewell_to_the_whole_lot&quot;&gt;CB1 antagonists&lt;/a&gt; for obesity?

And I’m just picking ones off the top of my head that had multiple large research organizations working on them – there are plenty more where that came from, especially if you just bring in the targets that were disastrous for just one or two companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these looked like worthwhile ideas at one point, and uncounted sums of money were spent on them (money from sales of other drugs to other customers and directly from investors). All of it could have been put to better use, but could you have done better? Sent people into areas that were less likely to fail, or found out that these mechanisms had something wrong with them without all the time, effort, and money? &lt;em&gt;Come on down and try it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>We have the answer to a question posed here earlier this month.

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is now operationally defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an infection, identified by an acute change in SOFA-Score of at least two points, including clinical chemistry such as creatinine or bilirubin concentrations. However, little knowledge exists about organ-specific microRNAs as potentially new biomarkers. Accordingly, we tested the hypotheses that micro-RNA-122, the foremost liver-related micro-RNA (miR), 1) discriminates between sepsis and infection, 2) is an early predictor for mortality, and 3) improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-score.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed 108 patients with sepsis (infection + increase SOFA-Score ≥2) within the first 24h of ICU admission and as controls 20 patients with infections without sepsis (infection + SOFA-Score ≤1). Total circulating miR was isolated from serum and relative miR-122 expression was measured (using spiked-in cel-miR-54) and associated with 30-day survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;30-day survival of the sepsis patients was 63%. miR-122 expression was 40-fold higher in non-survivors (p = 0.001) and increased almost 6-fold in survivors (p = 0.013) compared to controls. miR-122 serum-expression discriminated both between sepsis vs. infection (AUC 0.760, sensitivity 58.3%, specificity 95%) and survivors vs. non-survivors (AUC 0.728, sensitivity 42.5%, specificity 94%). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed miR-122 (HR 4.3; 95%-CI 2.0–8.9, p&amp;lt;0.001) as independent prognostic factor for 30-day mortality. Furthermore, the predictive value for 30-day mortality of the SOFA-Score (AUC 0.668) was improved by adding miR-122 (AUC 0.743; net reclassification improvement 0.37, p&amp;lt;0.001; integrated discrimination improvement 0.07, p = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Increased miR-122 serum concentration supports the discrimination between infection and sepsis, is an early and independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, and improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-Score, suggesting a potential role for miR-122 in sepsis-related prediction models.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526936400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><published>1526936400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Increased circulating microRNA-122 is a biomarker for discrimination and risk stratification in patients defined by sepsis-3 criteria</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197637</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tim Rahmel, Simon T.

Pigeon racing is a popular sport worldwide. Pigeons are under continuous selection to improve speed, spatial orientation, and endurance during long flights. However, numerous genetic and non-genetic factors affect survivability and homing ability, making such traits difficult for breeders to control. Polymorphisms in the lactate dehydrogenase A gene (&lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt;) likely affects pigeon racing and homing abilities, due to its role in physical and mental performance. Additionally, the adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt;) has been associated with physiological and behavioral shifts that occur during avian migration. In this study, we examined the association between &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; genotypes with pigeon survivability during racing competitions. Survivability was evaluated through the estimated breeding value (EBV) of each individual’s total race distances during its athletic life. &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; was not polymorphic among our samples, while &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes were significantly associated with deviated EBV values of longer total race distance; individuals carrying the &lt;i&gt;S+&lt;/i&gt; genotype had higher EBV (i.e., greater survivability). Thus, the &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; locus might be useful for marker-assisted selection, empowering breeders and trainers to maximize pigeon quality. Moreover, data obtained from breeding will also improve our understanding of the genetic mechanism underlying navigation and flight for wild migrating bird species.</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><published>1526677200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>LDHA gene is associated with pigeon survivability during racing competitions</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195121</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sherif Ramadan, Takeshi Miyake, Junichi Yamaura, Miho Inoue-Murayama&lt;/p&gt;

In this study, we examined the association between &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; genotypes with pigeon survivability during racing competitions. Survivability was evaluated through the estimated breeding value (EBV) of each individual’s total race distances during its athletic life. &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; was not polymorphic among our samples, while &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes were significantly associated with deviated EBV values of longer total race distance; individuals carrying the &lt;i&gt;S+&lt;/i&gt; genotype had higher EBV (i.e., greater survivability). Thus, the &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; locus might be useful for marker-assisted selection, empowering breeders and trainers to maximize pigeon quality. Moreover, data obtained from breeding will also improve our understanding of the genetic mechanism underlying navigation and flight for wild migrating bird species.</description><fingerprint>559650b6</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195121</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_163ad4688a8:21a1198:2835af05</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5681.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5681</canonicalUrl><author><name>Rebecca Turk-MacLeod, Alon Henson, Marc Rodriguez-Garcia, Graham M.

While many tropical countries are experiencing rapid deforestation, some have experienced forest transition (FT) from net deforestation to net reforestation. Numerous studies have identified causative factors of FT, among which forest scarcity has been considered as a prerequisite for FT. In fact, in SE Asia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, which experienced FT since 1990, exhibited a lower remaining forest area (30±8%) than the other five countries (68±6%, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar) where forest loss continues. In this study, we examined 1) the factors associated with forest scarcity, 2) the proximate and/or underlying factors that have driven forest area change, and 3) whether causative factors changed across FT phases (from deforestation to net forest gain) during 1980–2010 in the eight SE Asian countries. We used production of wood, food, and export-oriented food commodities as proximate causes and demographic, social, economic and environmental factors, as well as land-use efficiency, and wood and food trade as underlying causes that affect forest area change. Remaining forest area in 1990 was negatively correlated with population density and potential land area of lowland forests, while positively correlated with per capita wood production. This implies that countries rich in accessible and productive forests, and higher population pressures are the ones that have experienced forest scarcity, and eventually FT. Food production and agricultural input were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with forest area change during 1980–2009. This indicates that more food production drives deforestation, but higher efficiency of agriculture is correlated with forest gain. We also found a U-shaped response of forest area change to social openness, suggesting that forest gain can be achieved in both open and closed countries, but deforestation might be accelerated in countries undergoing societal transition. These results indicate the importance of environmental, agricultural and social variables on forest area dynamics, and have important implications for predicting future tropical forest change.</content></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><published>1526418000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Factors affecting forest area change in Southeast Asia during 1980-2010</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197391</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nobuo Imai, Takuya Furukawa, Riyou Tsujino, Shumpei Kitamura, Takakazu Yumoto&lt;/p&gt;

NANOG has been demonstrated to play an essential role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells, and its pseudogene, NANOGP8, is suggested to promote the cancer stem cell phenotype. As the roles of these genes are intimately involved with glioblastoma multiforme progression and exosomes are critical in intercellular communication, we conducted a detailed analysis of the association of the NANOG gene family with exosomes to identify diagnostic markers for cancer. Exosomes were precipitated from conditioned culture media from various cell lines, and NANOG gene fragments were directly amplified without DNA isolation using multiple primer sets. The use of the enzymes AlwNI and SmaI with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis functioned to distinguish NANOGP8 from other NANOG family members. Collectively, results suggest that the NANOG DNA associated with exosomes is not full length and that mixed populations of the NANOG gene family exist. Furthermore, sequence analysis of exosomal DNA amplified with a NANOGP8 specific primer set frequently showed an insertion of a 22 bp sequence into the 3’ UTR. The occurrence rate of this insertion was significantly higher in exosomal DNA clones from cancer cells as compared to normal cells. We have detected mixed populations of NANOG DNA associated with exosomes and have identified preferential modulations in the sequences from cancer samples. Our findings, coupled with the properties of exosomes, may allow for the detection of traditionally inaccessible cancers (i.e. GBM) through minimally invasive techniques.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To compare the relative changes in muscle-tendon complex (MTC) properties following high load resistance training (RT) in young males and females, and determine any link with circulating TGFβ-1 and IGF-I levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight participants were assigned to a training group and subdivided by sex (T males [TM] aged 20±1 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, T females [TF] aged 19±3 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8), whilst age-matched 6 males and 6 females were assigned to control groups (ConM/F). The training groups completed 8 weeks of resistance training (RT). MTC properties (Vastus Lateralis, VL) physiological cross-sectional area (pCSA), quadriceps torque, patella tendon stiffness [K], Young’s modulus, volume, cross-sectional area, and length, circulating levels of TGFβ-1 and IGF-I were assessed at baseline and post RT.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Post RT, there was a significant increase in the mechanical and morphological properties of the MTC in both training groups, compared to ConM/F (p&amp;lt;0.001). However, there were no significant sex-specific changes in most MTC variables. There were however significant sex differences in changes in K, with females exhibiting greater changes than males at lower MVC (Maximal Voluntary Contraction) force levels (10% p = 0.030 &amp;amp; 20% MVC p = 0.032) and the opposite effect seen at higher force levels (90% p = 0.040 &amp;amp; 100% MVC p = 0.044). There were significant increases (p&amp;lt;0.05) in IGF-I in both TF and TM following training, with no change in TGFβ-1. There were no gender differences (p&gt;0.05) in IGF-I or TGFβ-1. Interestingly, pooled population data showed that TGFβ-1 correlated with K at baseline, with no correlations identified between IGF-I and MTC properties.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Greater resting TGFβ-1 levels are associated with superior tendon mechanical properties.

Bandaging of limb wounds in horses leads to formation of exuberant granulation tissue (EGT) that retards healing due to protracted inflammation, aberrant vascularisation and delayed epithelialisation. EGT is not observed if wounds are left undressed or when wounds are on the body. A previous study showed that short-term administration of proteins derived from orf virus dampened inflammation and promoted epithelialisation of open wounds in horses. Here, we investigated the impact of orf virus interleukin-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor-E on the development and resolution of EGT. Excisional wounds were created on the forelimb of four horses, and bandages were maintained until full healing to induce EGT formation. Matching body wounds were created to ensure EGT was limited to the limb, and to differentiate the effects of the viral proteins on normal healing and on EGT formation. Viral proteins or the hydrogel vehicle control were administered topically to site-matched wounds at day 1, with repeat administration at day 8. Wound healing and EGT formation were monitored macroscopically. Wound margin samples were harvested at 2, 7 and 14 days, and at full healing, with histology used to observe epithelialisation, immunofluorescence used to detect inflammatory cells, angiogenesis and cell death, and qPCR to measure expression of genes regulating inflammation and angiogenesis. Limb wounds developed EGT, and exhibited slower healing than body wounds. Viral protein treatment did not accelerate healing at either location nor limit EGT formation in limb wounds. Treatment of limb wounds did however increase epithelialisation and angiogenesis, without dampening inflammatory cell infiltration or gene expression. The healed wounds also had less occlusion and death of blood vessels and fewer epidermal rete ridges following viral protein treatment. These findings indicate that the viral protein treatment does not suppress wound inflammation or EGT formation, but does promote vascular and epidermal repair and EGT resolution.</content></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><published>1526418000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Treatment of limb wounds of horses with orf virus IL-10 and VEGF-E accelerates resolution of exuberant granulation tissue, but does not prevent its development</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197223</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lyn M.

For example, while tumors are heterogeneous, tumors that have similar genomics profiles can also be expected to have similar responses to a specific therapy. Simple correlation coefficients provide an effective way to determine whether this principle holds when features and labels are both scalar, but not when either is multivariate. A new class of generalized correlation coefficients based on inter-point distances addresses this need and is called ``distance correlation&apos;&apos;. There is only one rank-based distance correlation test available to date, and it is asymmetric in the samples, requiring that one sample be distinguished as a fixed point of reference. Therefore, we introduce a novel, nonparametric statistic, REVA, inspired by the Kendall rank correlation coefficient.

For example, while tumors are heterogeneous, tumors that have similar genomics profiles can also be expected to have similar responses to a specific therapy. Simple correlation coefficients provide an effective way to determine whether this principle holds when features and labels are both scalar, but not when either is multivariate. A new class of generalized correlation coefficients based on inter-point distances addresses this need and is called ``distance correlation&apos;&apos;. There is only one rank-based distance correlation test available to date, and it is asymmetric in the samples, requiring that one sample be distinguished as a fixed point of reference. Therefore, we introduce a novel, nonparametric statistic, REVA, inspired by the Kendall rank correlation coefficient. We use U-statistic theory to derive the asymptotic distribution of the new correlation coefficient, developing additional large and finite sample properties along the way. To establish the admissibility of the REVA statistic, and explore the utility and limitations of our model, we compared it to the most widely used distance based correlation coefficient in a range of simulated conditions, demonstrating that REVA does not depend on an assumption of linearity, and is robust to high levels of noise, high dimensions, and the presence of outliers.

Electroporation of zygotes represents a rapid alternative to the elaborate pronuclear injection procedure for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mice. However, current protocols for electroporation either require the investment in specialized electroporators or corrosive pre-treatment of zygotes which compromises embryo viability. Here, we describe an easily adaptable approach for the introduction of specific mutations in C57BL/6 mice by electroporation of intact zygotes using a common electroporator with synthetic CRISPR/Cas9 components and minimal technical requirement. Direct comparison to conventional pronuclear injection demonstrates significantly reduced physical damage and thus improved embryo development with successful genome editing in up to 100% of living offspring. Hence, our novel approach for Easy Electroporation of Zygotes (EEZy) allows highly efficient generation of CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic mice while reducing the numbers of animals required.</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>An optimized electroporation approach for efficient CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in murine zygotes</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196891</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Simon E.

Thus, we hope that our integrated approach will further promote the usage of ontologies and controlled vocabularies in the clinical setting and in the biomedical domain.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/16/324053</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324053v1?rss=1</link></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7ce:93d646dc</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/616.2.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Mao, S.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><published>1525974002000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Stress granule transcription</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>96ddfc2</fingerprint><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_16344bbf04e:ab482a:93d646dc</id><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13523</originId><fingerprint>1324d7a2</fingerprint><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Here’s one to add to the “weird &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/08/11/lazy-mans-chemistry&quot;&gt;mechanosynthesis&lt;/a&gt;” pile. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b00931&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, you can do hydrogenation reactions in a stainless-steel ball mill, without any sort of noble-metal catalyst. The hydrogen is produced when you add some n-alkane or diethyl ether to the mix (these actually get converted to gaseous methane and hydrogen under the milling conditions). Some pretty severe reductions are realized, for example, taking biphenyl all the way down to 1-cyclohexylcyclohexane. Olefins go to alkanes under these conditions, of course, and ketones and alcohols tend to just get erased: it’s a bulldozer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although it’s surprising, this reaction isn’t quite as much voodoo as it might appear. Well, not more than any other hydrogenation, anyway. The ball mill is, of course, a sealed vessel, and the authors show that the lower-boiling additives seem to be more effective, presumably because they increase the internal pressure. And it’s not like there’s no catalyst present, because you have the stainless steel. If you use zirconium oxide balls instead of the steel alloy ones, for example, you get no hydrogenation at all. Adding bits of different metals back in showed that the chromium is what’s producing the hydrogen from the alkanes or ether, while the nickel is acting as the hydrogenation catalyst itself. The stainless-steel alloy itself (304 steel) was the most effective combination, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balls do get eroded a bit under the conditions, so what you’ve got is finely divided metals, under some heat from the mechanical energy of the milling, and under hydrogen pressure from the decomposition of the co-reactants. No wonder things get reduced! But it’s not a reaction that you would have predicted up front. And even if you’d stipulated that hydrogenation would start under these conditions, I don’t think you would have guessed how powerful it would be. The last time I hydrogenated down a whole aryl system (it’s been a while), I was running at something like 1600 psi (110 bar) at 120C with a rhodium catalyst, and the stuff came out looking – and smelling – like old lawnmower oil. This reaction probably doesn’t get above 60 degrees, by contrast. Admittedly, there’s no word in the paper about the appearance or aroma of the crude products, but I’m willing to bet that that part remains the same. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Here’s one to add to the “weird mechanosynthesis” pile.

The development of new dosimeters with good dosimetric properties is important for quality control in radiation applications. A new practical electron spin resonance (ESR) dosimeter based on carbonated hydroxyapatite that simulated the composition and structure of tooth enamel was specially synthesized.

The dosimetric properties were systematically investigated by ESR spectroscopy. The results indicated that the radiation induced signal had a good dose response within a relatively wide dose range. The dose response was linear in the dose range of 0–400 Gy with a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 and had dose accumulative effect in the experimental dose range of 0–100 Gy. In a wider dose range up to 30 kGy, the dose response also presented linear feature in double-logarithmic coordinate system with a correlation coefficient of 0.9970. The dose detection limit was about 0.34Gy with a given probability of 95% confidence level depending upon a rigid calculation algorithm. The signal was extremely stable in the observation time of 360 days with a variation coefficient of 3.8%. The radiation sensitivity of the material showed no remarkable variation against photon energy from 662 KeV to 1.25 MeV and dose rate from 0.86 Gy/min to 12.17 Gy/min. The material showed more sensitive in lower photon energy range below 662 keV, which hint additional calibration may need when using in special photon energy condition.

The preliminary results suggested that this newly developed dosimeter was potential to become a practical dosimeter that would expand the application fields of ESR dosimetry.</description><fingerprint>471ae031</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197953</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a190:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196773</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196773</canonicalUrl><author><name>Mia Liljeström</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mia Liljeström, Johanna Vartiainen, Jan Kujala, Riitta Salmelin&lt;/p&gt;
Reconfigurations of synchronized large-scale networks are thought to be central neural mechanisms that support cognition and behavior in the human brain. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings together with recent advances in network analysis now allow for sub-second snapshots of such networks. In the present study, we compared frequency-resolved functional connectivity patterns underlying reading of single words and visual recognition of symbol strings. Word reading emphasized coherence in a left-lateralized network with nodes in classical perisylvian language regions, whereas symbol processing recruited a bilateral network, including connections between frontal and parietal regions previously associated with spatial attention and visual working memory. Our results illustrate the flexible nature of functional networks, whereby processing of different form categories, written words vs. symbol strings, leads to the formation of large-scale functional networks that operate at distinct oscillatory frequencies and incorporate task-relevant regions. These results suggest that category-specific processing should be viewed not so much as a local process but as a distributed neural process implemented in signature networks. For words, increased coherence was detected particularly in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and high gamma (60–90 Hz) frequency bands, whereas increased coherence for symbol strings was observed in the high beta (21–29 Hz) and low gamma (30–45 Hz) frequency range. These findings attest to the role of coherence in specific frequency bands as a general mechanism for integrating stimulus-dependent information across brain regions.</content></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><published>1525294800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Large-scale functional networks connect differently for processing words and symbol strings</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196773</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mia Liljeström, Johanna Vartiainen, Jan Kujala, Riitta Salmelin&lt;/p&gt;

The prevalence of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing rapidly. Probiotics supplementation have been shown to improve metabolic health in humans. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics supplementation on metabolic health and pregnancy complications in pregnant women. The literature search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed, and data were synthesized in accordance with standardized guidelines. Ten randomized clinical trials with eligible data were included in our meta-analysis. For pregnant women with GDM, we found negative correlations between probiotics supplementation and fasting serum insulin (OR -2.94, 95%CI [-5.69, -0.20], p = 0.04) and homoeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (OR -0.65, 95%CI [-1.18, -0.11], p = 0.02). There were no significant correlations between probiotics supplementation and lipid levels in women with GDM, including total cholesterol (OR -2.72, 95%CI [-17.18, 11.74], P = 0.71), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (OR -0.29, 95%CI [-3.60, 3.03], P = 0.87), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (OR -0.38, 95%CI [-18.54, 17.79], P = 0.97), or triglycerides (OR -12.83, 95%CI [-36.63, 10.97], P = 0.29). For healthy pregnant women, probiotics supplementation were negatively associated with fasting serum insulin (OR -3.76, 95%CI [-4.29, -3.23], P &amp;lt; 0.00001) and HOMA-IR (OR -0.57, 95%CI [-1.08, -0.06], p = 0.03). However, no significant correlations were observed between probiotics supplementation and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (OR -2.02, 95%CI [-5.56, 1.52], p = 0.26). Thus, our study revealed that probiotics supplementation during pregnancy have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, rather than lipid metabolism among pregnant women.</content></content><updated>1526936400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><published>1526936400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The effects of probiotics supplementation on metabolic health in pregnant women: An evidence based meta-analysis</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197771</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jia Zheng, Qianyun Feng, Sheng Zheng, Xinhua Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

Total energy intake and intake from protein, fat, and carbohydrates were calculated.

However, our model also predicts that under hypoxia - activity of mitochondrial CK enzyme and diffusion of high-energy phosphate compounds may be insufficient to sustain uniform ATP/ADP distribution and hence force generation.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/22/327254</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327254v1?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00391/20180509/images/medium/cb-2018-00391b_0004.gif</url><height>247</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><id>ofNPcmQ46PpGzt1nO49W9STAvkUsM7jssLxNXMp09ME=_16345c2dc84:1b28608:abeb7260</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00391</originId><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00391</link><author><name>Alyssa N.

The cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) is implicated in neuroprotective signaling and neurotoxic pathways in both prion diseases and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (N-PrP) has been shown to interact with neurotoxic ligands, such as Aβ and Scrapie prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;), and to be crucial for the neuroprotective activity of PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;. To gain further insight into cellular pathways tied to PrP, we analyzed the brain interactome of N-PrP.

N-PrP beads were incubated with human AD or control brain lysates. N-PrP binding partners were then identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nano ESI-MS/MS). In addition to newly identified proteins we found many previously described PrP interactors, indicating a crucial role of the intrinsically disordered part of PrP in mediating protein interactions.

We spend a lot of time thinking about proteins in terms of their primary sequence and features of their three-dimensional structure (binding pockets, recognition domains, etc.) And that’s understandable. But it’s always important not to lose sight of the fact that the surfaces of proteins are decorated with all kinds of ornaments that are vital for their function, even if they’re synthetically hard to control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief among those are phosphates, you’d have to say. Kinases, of course, phosphorylate things and phosphatases take those back off (and as is often the case in biology, those two classes of enzymes are rather unbalanced: there are a lot more specific kinases out there, compared to a relatively small number of jack-of-all-trades phosphatases). Phosphorylation state can be a powerful on/off switch on specific protein residues, but it’s worth remembering that proteins can have a whole long list of phosphoryation sites once you get past the heavy-duty ones. The number of kinase inhibitors out there is proof enough that this method of regulating protein function can be taken advantage of, but it’s worth keeping in mind that making specifically phosphorylated proteins can be a painful process if you don’t have a living cell or at least a tame enzyme to do it for you. That’s particularly true if you’re interested in one of the less-common phosphorylation sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have a very different sort of polarity modification, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenylation&quot;&gt;prenylation&lt;/a&gt;. Farnesyl (or geranyl-geranyl) groups are small lipophilic chains that get attached to proteins to modify their function and/or cellular localization. Proteins also get decorated with even longer lipid chains via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitoylation&quot;&gt;palmitoylation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myristoylation&quot;&gt;myristoylation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s believed that these are generally involved in localizing things to membrane sites (as those greasy side chains settle into the lipid membrane). What’s for sure is that these modifications can make proteins rather tricky to work with (as is generally the case when you have a big polar/nonpolar structural separation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that you get to the proteins-modified-with-other-proteins class, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin&quot;&gt;ubiquitination&lt;/a&gt; at the head of that class. Ubiquitin, as the name implies, is all over the place, and proteins get ubiquitinated (at lysine residues) to mark them for degradation, to mark them not to be degraded, to change their localization and interaction networks, and for who knows what else. It’s a huge topic, since there are lots of varieties of ubiquitin attachment, and if you think we’ve got them all figured out you are sadly mistaken. Then there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUMO_protein&quot;&gt;SUMOylation&lt;/a&gt;, another add-a-small-protein process that’s clearly important but which we understand even less. It’s less common than ubiquitination (we think!), but there are several different sorts of SUMO proteins and places that they can be attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m skipping over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification&quot;&gt;several other&lt;/a&gt; post-translational modifications to get to a big class of them that I haven’t mentioned yet: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation&quot;&gt;glycosylations&lt;/a&gt;. Sugar molecules (and chains of them) are stapled on to residues like tyrosine, starting with good old glucose and going on from there. These things can also be linked through amine and sometimes even SH residues, and that is just the beginning. I did my graduate work using carbohydrates as starting materials for organic synthesis, and anyone who’s worked with them will have some appreciation of the complications that are available. With all those open hydroxyls available, carbohydrates have a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside&quot;&gt;linking possibilities&lt;/a&gt; (some more common than others, naturally), and you have the alpha/beta anomeric centers for variety as well. Two naturally occurring amino acids can give you four peptides, but two naturally occurring sugars can give you a whole lot more disaccharides, at least in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modifications are hugely important in proteins and many other biomolecules (including small-molecule natural products), but when I was in grad school, a lot of this was, chemically and biologically speaking, dark matter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK453015/&quot;&gt;A lot of it&lt;/a&gt; still is. Sometimes people would prefer just to ignor that part – even now, you’ll see total syntheses of some natural product as “whateverol aglycon”, that is, minus those pesky sugars. And when it comes to proteins, you almost have to rely on a living cell to glycosylate them properly, because chemically it can be a beast. A lot of chemical glycosylations are variations on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koenigs%E2%80%93Knorr_reaction&quot;&gt;Koenigs-Knorr&lt;/a&gt; reaction, with glycosyl halides, pseudohalides, and other leaving groups, and the number of variations on this is surely beyond counting. Holy cow, are there ever a lot of attempts to make glycosylation a better and more predictable reaction. My old “Lowe’s Laws of the Lab List” had one that went “&lt;em&gt;When there are twenty different ways of running a reaction in the literature, it means that there is no good way to run the reaction&lt;/em&gt;“, and the Koenigs-Knorr was what I had in mind. But it’s true: every time you vary the substrate being glycosylated or mess with the structure of the sugar part in any way, you can expect to see a new mixture of alpha/beta glycosides at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper I linked to so many paragraphs ago is a good shot, though, at taming this stuff for plain glucose-style glycosylation. The authors have a glycosyl fluoride protocol worked out (calcium hydroxide turns out to be a key addition) that seems to give pretty solid results on tyrosines (and phenols in general). What’s really impressive is that it works under aqueous conditions, using an unprotected sugar, and works on native (unprotected) proteins and peptides. It’s not perfect – you still get some glycosylation on other residues (serine, etc.), but it’s certainly the best I’ve ever seen. It would be interesting to see what happens when you try it on a protein with several possible tyrosines or with competing Cys residues, and I get the impression that the authors are heading there next. But even as it stands, this looks like a significantly better option than anything else out there for fast one-step glycosylation without messing around with protecting groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sorts of tools that are available for synthesizing, manipulating, and analyzing proteins and nucleic acids are (in general) just not available for carbohydrates. They either don’t exist anywhere or haven’t been domesticated from their biochemical forms. Only in recent years has the dream of automated polysaccharide synthesis come close &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/17/E3385&quot;&gt;to reality&lt;/a&gt;. Even in this paper, it’s worth noting that the authors weren’t really able to tell what all those other minor glycosylated side products were; it would be a major effort to run all those down. But this stuff is important, and every new technique that makes it easier to work in the area is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>This paper (from two groups at Yale’s chemistry department) addresses several important things that fall into the “important irritants” category in synthesis and molecular biology – or maybe that should be “irritatingly important”.

Background &lt;p&gt;Zoonotic diseases continue to be a public health burden globally. Uganda is especially vulnerable due to its location, biodiversity, and population. Given these concerns, the Ugandan government in collaboration with the Global Health Security Agenda conducted a One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization Workshop to identify zoonotic diseases of greatest national concern to the Ugandan government.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;The One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization tool, a semi-quantitative tool developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was used for the prioritization of zoonoses. Workshop participants included voting members and observers representing multiple government and non-governmental sectors. During the workshop, criteria for prioritization were selected, and questions and weights relevant to each criterion were determined. We used a decision tree to provide a ranked list of zoonoses. Participants then established next steps for multisectoral engagement for the prioritized zoonoses. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated how criteria weights impacted disease prioritization.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-eight zoonoses were considered during the workshop. Criteria selected to prioritize zoonotic diseases were (1) severity of disease in humans in Uganda, (2) availability of effective control strategies, (3) potential to cause an epidemic or pandemic in humans or animals, (4) social and economic impacts, and (5) bioterrorism potential. Seven zoonotic diseases were identified as priorities for Uganda: anthrax, zoonotic influenza viruses, viral hemorrhagic fevers, brucellosis, African trypanosomiasis, plague, and rabies. Sensitivity analysis did not indicate significant changes in zoonotic disease prioritization based on criteria weights.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;One Health approaches and multisectoral collaborations are crucial to the surveillance, prevention, and control strategies for zoonotic diseases. Uganda used such an approach to identify zoonoses of national concern. Identifying these priority diseases enables Uganda’s National One Health Platform and Zoonotic Disease Coordination Office to address these zoonoses in the future with a targeted allocation of resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525208400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><published>1525208400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Multisectoral prioritization of zoonotic diseases in Uganda, 2017: A One Health perspective</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196799</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Musa Sekamatte, Vikram Krishnasamy, Lilian Bulage, Christine Kihembo, Noelina Nantima, Fred Monje, Deo Ndumu, Juliet Sentumbwe, Betty Mbolanyi, Robert Aruho, Winyi Kaboyo, David Mutonga, Colin Basler, Sarah Paige, Casey Barton Behravesh&lt;/p&gt;

The spread of antibiotic resistance is always a consequence of evolutionary processes. The consideration of evolution is thus key to the development of sustainable therapy. Two main factors were recently proposed to enhance long-term effectiveness of drug combinations: evolved collateral sensitivities between the drugs in a pair and antagonistic drug interactions. We systematically assessed these factors by performing over 1,600 evolution experiments with the opportunistic nosocomial pathogen &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; in single- and multidrug environments. Based on the growth dynamics during these experiments, we reconstructed antibiotic combination efficacy (ACE) networks as a new tool for characterizing the ability of the tested drug combinations to constrain bacterial survival as well as drug resistance evolution across time. Subsequent statistical analysis of the influence of the factors on ACE network characteristics revealed that (i) synergistic drug interactions increased the likelihood of bacterial population extinction—irrespective of whether combinations were compared at the same level of inhibition or not—while (ii) the potential for evolved collateral sensitivities between 2 drugs accounted for a reduction in bacterial adaptation rates. In sum, our systematic experimental analysis allowed us to pinpoint 2 complementary determinants of combination efficacy and to identify specific drug pairs with high ACE scores. Our findings can guide attempts to further improve the sustainability of antibiotic therapy by simultaneously reducing pathogen load and resistance evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YvqYr2rgaRA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111333970</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/YvqYr2rgaRA/article</href></item></alternate><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Antibiotic combination efficacy (ACE) networks for a &amp;lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&amp;lt;/i&gt; model</title><recrawled>1525113004990</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Camilo Barbosa, Robert Beardmore, Hinrich Schulenburg, Gunther Jansen&lt;/p&gt;

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) originating from eukaryotes or bacteria have been under intensive structural and biochemical investigation, whereas archaeal PTP proteins have not been investigated extensively; therefore, they are poorly understood. Here, we present the crystal structures of Tk-PTP derived from the hyperthermophilic archaeon &lt;i&gt;Thermococcus kodakaraensis&lt;/i&gt; KOD1, in both the active and inactive forms. Tk-PTP adopts a common dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) fold, but it undergoes an atypical temperature-dependent conformational change in its P-loop and α4−α5 loop regions, switching between the inactive and active forms. Through comprehensive analyses of Tk-PTP, including additional structural determination of the G95A mutant form, enzymatic activity assays, and structural comparison with the other archaeal PTP, it was revealed that the presence of the GG motif in the P-loop is necessary but not sufficient for the structural flexibility of Tk-PTP. It was also proven that Tk-PTP contains dual general acid/base residues unlike most of the other DUSP proteins, and that both the residues are critical in its phosphatase activity. This work provides the basis for expanding our understanding of the previously uncharacterized PTP proteins from archaea, the third domain of living organisms.</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><published>1527109200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Structural study reveals the temperature-dependent conformational flexibility of Tk-PTP, a protein tyrosine phosphatase from &amp;lt;i&gt;Thermococcus kodakaraensis&amp;lt;/i&gt; KOD1</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197635</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hye-Yeoung Yun, Jinhyuk Lee, Hyunmin Kim, Hyojung Ryu, Ho-Chul Shin, Byung-Ha Oh, Bonsu Ku, Seung Jun Kim&lt;/p&gt;

(“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/health-44288503&quot;&gt;Remarkably promising&lt;/a&gt;” – BBC. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/29/brain-cancer-vaccine-could-extend-lives-patients-years-dcvax-tessa-jowell&quot;&gt;Could add years&lt;/a&gt;” – The Guardian. And there’s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5783403/Brain-cancer-vaccine-extend-lives-patients-years.html&quot;&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; (naturally), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/brain-cancer-vaccine-tessa-jowell-tumour-patients-clinical-trial-a8374886.html&quot;&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;, and more). That would be good news, because that’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/20/glioblastoma-is-bad-news-period&quot;&gt;terrible diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; with very little in the way of effective treatment. But if you get your breaking biomedical news from the British press, then I am very sorry for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because this is DCVax, from Northwest Biotherapeutics. And this vaccine has been twisting and turning through the clinic for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/brain-cancer-vaccine-tessa-jowell-tumour-patients-clinical-trial-a8374886.html&quot;&gt;ten years now&lt;/a&gt;, under circumstances more suited for a soap opera than for a biotech company. I’m not sure I can summarize it all – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-report/7-northwest-biotherapeutics&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/story/14072951/1/northwest-bio-executive-pleads-ignorance-about-clinical-trial-halt-stock-collapse.html&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; reprising the story as of last year, so start there. (If you’re a Stat Plus subscriber, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2018/02/15/northwest-bio-clinical-trial/&quot;&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt;). There have been financial troubles, allegations and investigations, clinical holds, claims and counterclaims – and through it all, the one constant has been the NWBO has &lt;em&gt;never been able to explain to anyone&lt;/em&gt; quite what is going on. That even goes for questions like “Why did regulatory agencies put a hold on your trial?”, “Why haven’t you enrolled the number of patients you said you would?”, and “When will you have actual data to present?” Minor stuff. At one point, the company actually attempted to explain a delay by saying that members of its management team had the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/09/29/the_case_of_northwest_biotherapeutics&quot;&gt;last wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the company in 2014, during yet another bizarre development. That was when a Washington Post columnist went after Adam Feuerstein (then with TheStreet.com) for being part of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-a-washington-post-columnist-takes-aim-at-shortsellers-but-misfires-20140929-column.html&quot;&gt;conspiracy of evil short-sellers&lt;/a&gt; trying to harm this innocent little company. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/story/12929412/1/washington-posts-pearlstein-didnt-intend-to-disparage-thestreets-integrity.html&quot;&gt;letter of apology&lt;/a&gt; was eventually produced, albeit a carefully worded and rather lawyerly one, and I would submit that the subsequent history of NWBO illustrates that no evil conspiracy has been required. They were delisted from the NASDAQ, for example, and have been trading as a penny stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-018-1507-6&quot;&gt;has now published&lt;/a&gt; some analysis of the interim data, but as that Stat Plus piece makes clear, this is not really a satisfactory way of handling things. The company itself says that it has not reached the number of overall-survival cases that it needs to declare the trial finished, so the data are supposed to still be completely blinded. Because of the trial’s crossover design (patients getting standard of care could later on receive DCvax if the glioblastoma recurred, which it almost always does), about 90% of the trial’s participants have ended up getting the vaccine. That sounds like it’s going to make the workup of the data rather complicated, and it could also make the actual comparison to standard of care tricky as well. The current paper doesn’t address these questions, because it can’t, other than to say that since the great majority of the patients got the vaccine anyway, hey, let’s just look at the still-blinded data and run with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They expect to hit their overall number later this summer, and at that point they’ll start working through the data. The company has already warned investors that this could take many months, so it’s anyone’s guess when we’ll see the actual results. No celebrations should take place until that occurs. The entire dendritic-cell-vaccine idea that the company is working on has been kicking around for at least twenty years now, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendreon&quot;&gt;little success&lt;/a&gt;, and DCVax itself first entered the clinic in 2002. The company has also worked on a prostate cancer vaccine using the same methods, but although a Phase II trial completed about ten years ago, they have never been able to partner it with anyone to go into Phase III. Couple this with the extremely aggressive and constantly changing nature of glioblastoma itself, and it’s hard to be optimistic. Unless you read the British papers.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>If you get your biomedical breaking news from the British press, you will have heard all about a very promising vaccine treatment for glioblastoma.

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major mediator of peritoneal fibrosis and reportedly affects expression of the H3K4 methyltransferase, SET7/9. SET7/9-induced H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) critically activates transcription of fibrosis-related genes. In this study, we examined the effect of SET7/9 inhibition on peritoneal fibrosis in mice and in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). We also examined SET7/9 expression in nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Murine peritoneal fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of methylglyoxal (MGO) into male C57/BL6 mice over 21 days. Sinefungin, a SET7/9 inhibitor, was administered subcutaneously just before MGO injection (10 mg/kg). SET7/9 expression was elevated in both MGO-injected mice and nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of PD patients. SET7/9 expression was positively correlated with dialysate/plasma ratio of creatinine in PD patients. Sinefungin was shown immunohistochemically to suppress expression of mesenchymal cells and collagen deposition, accompanied by decreased H3K4me1 levels. Peritoneal equilibration tests showed that sinefungin attenuated the urea nitrogen transport rate from plasma and the glucose absorption rate from the dialysate. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, sinefungin suppressed TGF-β1-induced expression of fibrotic markers and inhibited H3K4me1. These findings suggest that inhibiting the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis.</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Inhibition of the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196844</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Tamura, Shigehiro Doi, Ayumu Nakashima, Kensuke Sasaki, Kazuya Maeda, Toshinori Ueno, Takao Masaki&lt;/p&gt;

To examine the origin of seizures induced by severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, The EEG characteristics of seizures were analyzed in newborns with and without severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the specificity. In total, 931 patients had a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level of 340–425 μmol/L, only 2 of whom had seizures. Compared to patients with hyperbilirubinemia and a TSB level of 340–425 μmol/L, those with a TSB level &gt;425 μmol/L had a significant risk of seizure (OR = 213.2, 95% CI = 113.0–405.8, P&amp;lt;0.001). Of all 28 patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia and seizure, 26 had seizures that originated in the temporal and/or occipital lobe. In seizure patients without severe hyperbilirubinemia, origination in the temporal/occipital and other lobes occurred in 19 and 117 cases, respectively. Compared to the risk of seizure origination in the temporal and/or occipital lobe in other diseases, the risk in patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia was increased by approximately 80 times (OR = 80.1, 95% CI = 28.3–226.4, P&amp;lt;0.001). Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia can selectively induce temporal and occipital lobe seizures. This is the first report of a new syndrome with the same etiology and electrophysiological features as epilepsy.</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><published>1526072400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia induces temporal and occipital lobe seizures</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197113</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lian Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

It is common in practicing orthognathic surgery to evaluate faces with retruded or protruded chins (dysgnathic faces) using photographs. Because motion may alter how the face is perceived, we investigated the perception of faces presented via photographs and videos. Two hundred naïve raters (lay persons, without maxillo facial surgery background) evaluated 12 subjects with varying chin anatomy [so-called skeletal Class I (normal chin), Class II (retruded chin), and Class III (protruded chin)]. Starting from eight traits, with Factor analysis we found a two-Factor solution, i.e. an &amp;quot;aesthetics associated traits cluster&amp;quot; and a Factor &amp;quot;personality traits cluster&amp;quot; which appeared to be uncorrelated. Internal consistency of the Factors found for photographs and videos was excellent. Generally, female raters delivered better ratings than males, but the effect sizes were small. We analyzed differences and the respective effect magnitude between photograph and video perception. For each skeletal class the aesthetics associated dimensions were rated similarly between photographs and video clips. In contrast, specific personality traits were rated differently. Differences in the class-specific personality traits seen on photographs were &amp;quot;smoothed&amp;quot; in the assessment of videos, which implies that photos enhance stereotypes commonly attributed to a retruded or protruded chin.</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><published>1526677200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Perception of aesthetics and personality traits in orthognathic surgery patients: A comparison of still and moving images</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196856</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Klaus Sinko, Ulrich S.

We show that these algorithms increase comparability within large datasets of spectra, facilitating comparative analysis, such as machine learning.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/25/292425</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292425v5?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/18/4619/F1.medium.gif</url><height>383</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1631d51f359:2877c84:fc1f8953</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4619.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4619</canonicalUrl><author><name>John Vontas, Linda Grigoraki, John Morgan, Dimitra Tsakireli, Godwin Fuseini, Luis Segura, Julie Niemczura de Carvalho, Raul Nguema, David Weetman, Michel A.

&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values represent a widely used, but pervasively misunderstood and fiercely contested method of scientific inference. Display items, such as figures and tables, often containing the main results, are an important source of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. We conducted a survey comparing the overall use of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and the occurrence of significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items of a sample of articles in the three top multidisciplinary journals (Nature, Science, PNAS) in 2017 and, respectively, in 1997. We also examined the reporting of multiplicity corrections and its potential influence on the proportion of statistically significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. Our findings demonstrated substantial and growing reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items, with increases of 2.5 to 14.5 times in 2017 compared to 1997. The overwhelming majority of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values (94%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 92% to 96%) were statistically significant. Methods to adjust for multiplicity were almost non-existent in 1997, but reported in many articles relying on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in 2017 (Nature 68%, Science 48%, PNAS 38%). In their absence, almost all reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant (98%, 95% CI 96% to 99%). Conversely, when any multiplicity corrections were described, 88% (95% CI 82% to 93%) of reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant. Use of Bayesian methods was scant (2.5%) and rarely (0.7%) articles relied exclusively on Bayesian statistics. Overall, wider appreciation of the need for multiplicity corrections is a welcome evolution, but the rapid growth of reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and implausibly high rates of reported statistical significance are worrisome.</content></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><published>1526418000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;P&amp;lt;/i&gt; values in display items are ubiquitous and almost invariably significant: A survey of top science journals</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197440</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ioana Alina Cristea, John P.

The bionematicidal effect of a synthetic volatile mixture (SVM) of four volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the endophytic fungus &lt;i&gt;Daldinia cf&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;concentrica&lt;/i&gt; against the devastating plant-parasitic root-knot nematode &lt;i&gt;Meloidogyne javanica&lt;/i&gt; has been recently demonstrated in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and greenhouse experiments. However, the mode of action governing the observed irreversible paralysis of J2 larvae upon exposure to SVM is unknown. To unravel the mechanism underlying the anthelmintic and nematicidal activities, we used the tractable model worm &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; was also susceptible to both the fungal VOCs and SVM. Among compounds comprising SVM, 3-methyl-1-butanol, (±)-2-methyl-1-butanol, and 4-heptanone showed significant nematicidal activity toward L1, L4 and young adult stages. Egg hatching was only negatively affected by 4-heptanone. To determine the mechanism underlying this activity, we examined the response of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; mutants for glutamate-gated chloride channel and acetylcholine transporter, targets of the nematicidal drugs ivermectin and aldicarb, respectively, to 4-heptanone and SVM. These aldicarb- and ivermectin-resistant mutants retained susceptibility upon exposure to 4-heptanone and SVM. Next, we used &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; TJ356 strain &lt;i&gt;zIs356 (daf-16&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP+rol-6)&lt;/i&gt;, LD1 &lt;i&gt;ldIs7&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;skn-1B/C&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP + pRF4&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;rol-6&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;su1006&lt;/i&gt;))], LD1171 &lt;i&gt;ldIs3 [gcs-1p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;gfp; rol-6(su1006))]&lt;/i&gt;, CL2166 &lt;i&gt;dvIs19 (gst-4p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP)&lt;/i&gt; and CF1553 &lt;i&gt;muIs84 (sod-3p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP+rol-6)&lt;/i&gt;, which have mutations in genes regulating multiple stress responses. Following exposure of L4 larvae to 4-heptanone or SVM, there was clear nuclear translocation of DAF-16::GFP, and SKN-1::GFP indicating that their susceptibility involves DAF-16 and SKN1 regulation. Application of 4-heptanone, but not SVM, induced increased expression of, &lt;i&gt;gcs-1&lt;/i&gt;::GFP and &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt;::GFP compared to controls. In contrast, application of 4-heptanone or SVM to the &lt;i&gt;sod-3&lt;/i&gt;::GFP line elicited a significant decline in overall fluorescence intensity compared to controls, indicating SOD-3 downregulation and therefore overall reduction in cellular redox machinery. Our data indicate that the mode of action of SVM and 4-heptanone from &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cf&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;concentrica&lt;/i&gt; differs from that of currently available nematicides, potentially offering new solutions for nematode management.</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525379227412</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; susceptibility to &amp;lt;i&gt;Daldinia&amp;lt;/i&gt; cf. &amp;lt;i&gt;concentrica&amp;lt;/i&gt; bioactive volatiles is coupled with expression activation of the stress-response transcription factor &amp;lt;i&gt;daf-16&amp;lt;/i&gt;, a part of distinct nematicidal action</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196870</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Payal Sanadhya, Patricia Bucki, Orna Liarzi, David Ezra, Abraham Gamliel, Sigal Braun Miyara&lt;/p&gt;

Among compounds comprising SVM, 3-methyl-1-butanol, (±)-2-methyl-1-butanol, and 4-heptanone showed significant nematicidal activity toward L1, L4 and young adult stages. Egg hatching was only negatively affected by 4-heptanone. To determine the mechanism underlying this activity, we examined the response of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; mutants for glutamate-gated chloride channel and acetylcholine transporter, targets of the nematicidal drugs ivermectin and aldicarb, respectively, to 4-heptanone and SVM. These aldicarb- and ivermectin-resistant mutants retained susceptibility upon exposure to 4-heptanone and SVM. Next, we used &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; TJ356 strain &lt;i&gt;zIs356 (daf-16&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP+rol-6)&lt;/i&gt;, LD1 &lt;i&gt;ldIs7&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;skn-1B/C&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP + pRF4&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;rol-6&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;su1006&lt;/i&gt;))], LD1171 &lt;i&gt;ldIs3 [gcs-1p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;gfp; rol-6(su1006))]&lt;/i&gt;, CL2166 &lt;i&gt;dvIs19 (gst-4p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP)&lt;/i&gt; and CF1553 &lt;i&gt;muIs84 (sod-3p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP+rol-6)&lt;/i&gt;, which have mutations in genes regulating multiple stress responses. Following exposure of L4 larvae to 4-heptanone or SVM, there was clear nuclear translocation of DAF-16::GFP, and SKN-1::GFP indicating that their susceptibility involves DAF-16 and SKN1 regulation. Application of 4-heptanone, but not SVM, induced increased expression of, &lt;i&gt;gcs-1&lt;/i&gt;::GFP and &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt;::GFP compared to controls. In contrast, application of 4-heptanone or SVM to the &lt;i&gt;sod-3&lt;/i&gt;::GFP line elicited a significant decline in overall fluorescence intensity compared to controls, indicating SOD-3 downregulation and therefore overall reduction in cellular redox machinery. Our data indicate that the mode of action of SVM and 4-heptanone from &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cf&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;concentrica&lt;/i&gt; differs from that of currently available nematicides, potentially offering new solutions for nematode management.</description><fingerprint>8952e0ec</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196870</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.7b01191/20180511/images/medium/bi-2017-011914_0009.gif</url><height>289</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_16350eac610:1ca89:c7b34489</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01191</originId><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01191</link><author><name>Rahul Sharma, Shivlee Nirwal, Naveen Narayanan, Deepak T.

Statistical inference is a widely-used, powerful tool for learning about natural processes in diverse fields. The statistical software platforms AD Model Builder (ADMB) and Template Model Builder (TMB) are particularly popular in the ecological literature, where they are typically used to perform frequentist inference of complex models. However, both lack capabilities for flexible and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. Recently, the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) MCMC algorithm has gained popularity for Bayesian inference through the software Stan because it is efficient for high dimensional, complex hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R packages adnuts and tmbstan, which provide NUTS sampling in parallel and interactive diagnostics with ShinyStan. The ADMB source code was modified to provide NUTS, while TMB models are linked directly into Stan. We describe the packages, provide case studies demonstrating their use, and contrast performance against Stan. For TMB models, we show how to test the accuracy of the Laplace approximation using NUTS. For complex models, the performance of ADMB and TMB was typically within +/- 50% the speed of Stan. In one TMB case study we found inaccuracies in the Laplace approximation, potentially leading to biased inference. adnuts provides a new method for estimating hierarchical ADMB models which previously were infeasible. TMB users can fit the same model in both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, including using NUTS to test the validity of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for arbitrary subsets of parameters. These software developments extend the available statistical methods of the ADMB and TMB user base with no additional effort by the user.</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>No-U-turn sampling for fast Bayesian inference in ADMB and TMB: Introducing the adnuts and tmbstan R packages</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197954</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cole C.

One of the most ambitious endeavors in the field of diabetes technology is non-invasive glucose sensing. In the past decades, a number of different technologies have been assessed, but none of these have found its entry into general clinical use. We report on the development of a table-top confocal Raman spectrometer that was used in the home of patients with diabetes and operated for extended periods of time unsupervised and without recalibration. The system is based on measurement of glucose levels at a ‘critical depth’ in the skin, specifically in the interstitial fluid located below the stratum corneum but above the underlying adipose tissue layer. The region chosen for routine glucose measurements was the base of the thumb (the thenar). In a small clinical study, 35 patients with diabetes analyzed their interstitial fluid glucose for a period of 60 days using the new critical-depth Raman (CD-Raman) method and levels were correlated to reference capillary blood glucose values using a standard finger-stick and test strip product. The calibration of the CD-Raman system was stable for &gt; 10 days. Measurement performance for glucose levels present at, or below, a depth of ~250μm below the skin surface was comparable to that reported for currently available invasive continuous glucose monitors. In summary, using the CD-Raman technology we have demonstrated the first successful use of a non-invasive glucose monitor in the home.</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><published>1526072400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Critical-depth Raman spectroscopy enables home-use non-invasive glucose monitoring</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197134</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Signe M.

In summary, using the CD-Raman technology we have demonstrated the first successful use of a non-invasive glucose monitor in the home.</description><fingerprint>da6a5b19</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197134</link></item><item><engagement>3</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nrd.2018.74-f1.jpg</url><height>402</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><id>YLwIhSxZAzQIEnJq1FGGcXUQMCbQUlr9cyNMExMVeyY=_16395adc200:1275b1:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.74</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.74</link><author><name>Jun Tang</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The global landscape of cancer cell therapy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global landscape of cancer cell therapy, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.74&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;How many cancer cell therapies are being developed?

Adult stem cells are considered multipotent, restricted to differentiate into a few tissue-specific cell types. With the advent of technologies which can dedifferentiate and transdifferentiate cell types, assumptions about the process of cell fate determination must be reconsidered, including the role of extrinsic versus intrinsic factors. To determine the plasticity of adult neural progenitors, rat hippocampal progenitor cells were xenotransplanted into embryonic zebrafish. These animals allow for easy detection of transplanted cells due to their external development and transparency at early stages. Adult neural progenitors were observed throughout the zebrafish for the duration of the experiment (at least five days post-transplantation). While the majority of transplanted cells were observed in the central nervous system, a large percentage of cells were located in superficial tissues. However, approximately one-third of these cells retained neural morphology and expression of the neuronal marker, Class III β-tubulin, indicating that the transplanted adult neural progenitors did not adapt alternate fates. A very small subset of cells demonstrated unique, non-neural flattened morphology, suggesting that adult neural progenitors may exhibit plasticity in this model, though at a very low rate. These findings demonstrate that the developing zebrafish may be an efficient model to explore plasticity of a variety of adult stem cell types and the role of external factors on cell fate.</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Xenotransplantation of adult hippocampal neural progenitors into the developing zebrafish for assessment of stem cell plasticity</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198025</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Mothers with severe mental illness are vulnerable and engage with services cautiously due to fears of stigma and custody loss. To develop best practice standards and patient-centred services, the subjective experience of those who use it must inform service improvement and policy.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;This study utilised exploratory concurrent mixed methods design with primarily qualitative data. Women admitted between April 2015 and December 2016 to a newly developed psychiatric Mother Baby Unit (MBU) in New Zealand were invited to participate in this study. Qualitative data were collected in three ways: (i) semi-structured interviews incorporating Māori concepts of health and wellness by research assistants near discharge; (ii) invitation to provide anonymous feedback in writing using an open format; (iii) unsolicited verbal feedback provided during a home visit three months after discharge. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Demographic and clinical information was collected prospectively for mother-infant pairs during the course of admission and three months post-discharge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-five people participated in the study. High rates of satisfaction were described. Strengths of the service–as perceived by mothers–included co-admission of mother and infant, staff warmth and availability, transparent practice, inclusion of families, and having a comfortable environment. Mothers described intense distress and confusion, as well as negative self-perceptions when acutely unwell. Infant co-admission and the inclusion of partners and other family members alleviated mothers’ distress. Personal attributes of staff, practical support with caregiving, a range of therapeutic approaches and holistic care were all valued. Feedback collected three months after discharge was the most reflective. Significant inter-ethnic differences were not apparent.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The experience of inpatient care can have lasting influence on recovery and wellbeing. Employing a Māori model of health broadened the holistic nature of enquiry. The approach and timing taken in seeking the views of participants’ yielded different information, all of which is of value to service evaluation and refinement. The findings suggest that keeping mothers and infants together during health service utilisation such as MBUs should be a priority for policy makers and service designers. This approach is consistent with Māori values, combining the importance of whānau relationships (kinship), wairua (spiritual connectivity), hinengaro (the mind) and tinana (physical health). These findings suggest that ‘holistic care’–in this case following a Māori holistic health model–is important in mental health settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><published>1527714000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Patient experience of a psychiatric Mother Baby Unit</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198241</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>2984529c</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tanya Wright, Tanisha Jowsey, Josephine Stanton, Hinemoa Elder, Suzanne Stevens, Trecia A.

The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein Merlin functions as a negative regulator of cell growth and actin dynamics in different cell types amongst which Schwann cells have been extensively studied. In contrast, the presence and the role of Merlin in oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells within the CNS, have not been elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that Merlin immunoreactivity was broadly distributed in the white matter throughout the central nervous system. Following Merlin expression during development in the cerebellum, Merlin could be detected in the cerebellar white matter tract at early postnatal stages as shown by its co-localization with Olig2-positive cells as well as in adult brain sections where it was aligned with myelin basic protein containing fibers. This suggests that Merlin is expressed in immature and mature oligodendrocytes. Expression levels of Merlin were low in oligodendrocytes as compared to astrocytes and neurons throughout development. Expression of Merlin in oligodendroglia was further supported by its identification in either immortalized cell lines of oligodendroglial origin or in primary oligodendrocyte cultures. In these cultures, the two main splice variants of &lt;i&gt;Nf2&lt;/i&gt; could be detected. Merlin was localized in clusters within the nuclei and in the cytoplasm. Overexpressing Merlin in oligodendrocyte cell lines strengthened reduced impedance in XCELLigence measurements and Ki67 stainings in cultures over time. In addition, the initiation and elongation of cellular projections were reduced by Merlin overexpression. Consistently, cell migration was retarded in scratch assays done on &lt;i&gt;Nf2&lt;/i&gt;-transfected oligodendrocyte cell lines. These data suggest that Merlin actively modulates process outgrowth and migration in oligodendrocytes.</content></content><updated>1525208400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><published>1525208400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor protein is expressed in oligodendrocytes and regulates cell proliferation and process formation</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196726</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Toledo, Elena Grieger, Khalad Karram, Helen Morrison, Stephan L.

These data suggest that Merlin actively modulates process outgrowth and migration in oligodendrocytes.</description><fingerprint>331e007f</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196726</link></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce93f:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/871-b?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/871.2.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Yeston, J.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><published>1527183688000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Aluminum&apos;s breakup with fluoroalkenes</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/871-b?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>a02f48c8</fingerprint><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/871-b?rss=1</link></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1639679584a:2569bb:7cfe07d6</id><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25228?af=R</originId><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25228?af=R</link><author><name>ShunSakuraba

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF &lt;i&gt;OCT4&lt;/i&gt;, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and to endodermal tumor formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types.</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><published>1526072400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Generation of hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells from human induced endodermal progenitor cells</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197046</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rangarajan Sambathkumar, Renate Akkerman, Sumitava Dastidar, Philip Roelandt, Manoj Kumar, Manmohan Bajaj, Ana Rita Mestre Rosa, Nicky Helsen, Veerle Vanslembrouck, Eric Kalo, Satish Khurana, Jos Laureys, Conny Gysemans, Marijke M.

Interferon lambda (IFNλ) is a group of cytokines that belong to the IL-10 family. They exhibit antiviral activities against certain viruses during infection of the liver and mucosal tissues. Here we report that IFNλ restricts &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; replication of the β-herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV). However, IFNλR1-deficient (&lt;i&gt;Ifnλr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) mice were not preferentially susceptible to mCMV infection &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; during acute infection after systemic or mucosal challenge, or during virus persistence in the mucosa. Instead, our studies revealed that IFNλ influences NK cell responses during mCMV infection. &lt;i&gt;Ifnλr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited defective development of conventional interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-expressing NK cells in the spleen during mCMV infection whereas accumulation of granzyme B-expressing NK cells was unaltered. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, development of splenic IFNγ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; NK cells following stimulation with IL-12 or, to a lesser extent, IL-18 was abrogated by IFNλR1-deficiency. Thus, IFNλ regulates NK cell responses during mCMV infection and restricts virus replication &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; but is redundant in the control of acute and persistent mCMV replication within mucosal and non-mucosal tissues.</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><published>1526504400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Interferon lambda is required for interferon gamma-expressing NK cell responses but does not afford antiviral protection during acute and persistent murine cytomegalovirus infection</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197596</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Silvia Gimeno Brias, Morgan Marsden, Jessica Forbester, Mathew Clement, Cordelia Brandt, Katherine Harcourt, Leanne Kane, Lucy Chapman, Simon Clare, Ian R.

Thus, IFNλ regulates NK cell responses during mCMV infection and restricts virus replication &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; but is redundant in the control of acute and persistent mCMV replication within mucosal and non-mucosal tissues.</description><fingerprint>31837e37</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197596</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e5d:fc1f8953</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196682</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196682</canonicalUrl><author><name>Jordana Miranda de Souza Silva</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jordana Miranda de Souza Silva, Paulo Vinicius Gil Alabarse, Vivian de Oliveira Nunes Teixeira, Eduarda Correa Freitas, Francine Hehn de Oliveira, Rafael Mendonça da Silva Chakr, Ricardo Machado Xavier&lt;/p&gt;
This study aimed to investigate the molecular pathways involved in muscle wasting in an animal model of osteoarthritis (OA) induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) in rats. Reduction of protein syntheses, increased proteolysis and impaired muscle regeneration are important pathways related to muscle wasting, and myogenin, MyoD, myostatin and MuRF-1 are some of their markers. Female Wistar rats were allocated into two groups: OA (submitted to the ACLT) and SHAM (submitted to surgery without ACLT). Nociception, spontaneous exploratory locomotion and body weight of animals were evaluated weekly. Twelve weeks after the disease induction, animals were euthanized, and the right knee joints were collected. Gastrocnemius muscle of the right hind paw were dissected and weighed. Gastrocnemius was used for evaluation of muscle atrophy and expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, Pax7, myogenin, MyoD, myostatin and MuRF-1. Histopathology of the knee confirmed the development of the disease in animals of OA group. Gastrocnemius of OA animals showed a reduction of about 10% in area and an increased IL-1β expression compared to animals of SHAM group. Expression of myostatin was increased in OA group, while myogenin expression was decreased. TNF-α, Pax7, MuRF-1 and MyoD expression was similar in both OA and SHAM groups. Nociception was significantly elevated in OA animals in the last two weeks of experimental period. Spontaneous exploratory locomotion, body weight and weight of gastrocnemius showed no difference between OA and SHAM groups. Gastrocnemius atrophy in OA induced by ACLT involves elevated expression of IL-1β within the muscle, as well as increased expression of myostatin and decreased expression of myogenin. Therefore, muscle wasting may be linked to impaired muscle regeneration.</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Muscle wasting in osteoarthritis model induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196682</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jordana Miranda de Souza Silva, Paulo Vinicius Gil Alabarse, Vivian de Oliveira Nunes Teixeira, Eduarda Correa Freitas, Francine Hehn de Oliveira, Rafael Mendonça da Silva Chakr, Ricardo Machado Xavier&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Effective HIV prevention requires efficient delivery of safe and efficacious drugs and optimization of user adherence. The user’s experiences with the drug, delivery system, and use parameters are critical to product acceptability and adherence. Prevention product developers have the opportunity to directly control a drug delivery system and its impact on acceptability and adherence, as well as product efficacy. Involvement of potential users during preclinical design and development can facilitate this process. We embedded a mixed methods user evaluation study into a safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) trial of a pod-intravaginal ring delivering antiretroviral agents.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;Women enrolled in two cohorts, ultimately evaluating the safety/PK of a pod-IVRs delivering TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, and/or TDF-FTC-MVC. A 7-day use period was targeted for each pod-IVR, regardless of drug or drug combination. During the clinical study, participants provided both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., in-depth interview) data capturing acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence behaviors. Initial sexual and reproductive health history surveys, daily diaries, a final acceptability and willingness to use survey, and a qualitative in-depth interview comprised the user evaluation data for each pod-IVR experienced by the participants.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Overall, the majority of participants (N = 10) reported being willing to use the pod-IVR platform for HIV prevention should it advance to market. Confidence to use the pod-IVR (e.g., insertion, removal) was high. There were no differences noted in the user experience of the pod-IVR platform; that is, whether the ring delivered TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, or TDF-FTC-MVC, users’ experiences of the ring were similar and acceptable. Participants did report specific experiences, both sensory and behavioral, that impacted their use behaviors with respect to the ring, and which could ultimately impact acceptability and adherence. These experiences, and user evaluations elicited by them, could both challenge use or be used to leverage use in future trials and product rollout once fully articulated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;High willingness-to-use data and lack of salient differences in user experiences related to use of the pod-IVR platform (regardless of agents delivered) suggests that the pod-IVR is a feasible and acceptable drug delivery device in and of itself. This finding holds promise both for an anti-HIV pod-IVR and, potentially, a multipurpose prevention pod-IVR that could deliver both prevention for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and contraception. Given the very early clinical trial context, further acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence data should continue to be explored, in the context of longer use periods (e.g., 28-day ring use), and in the contexts of sexual activity and menses. Using early design and development contexts to gain insights into potential challenges and facilitators of drug delivery systems such as the pod-IVR could save valuable resources and time as a potential biomedical technology moves through the clinical trial pipeline and into real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><published>1526331600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>User evaluations offer promise for pod-intravaginal ring as a drug delivery platform: A mixed methods study of acceptability and use experiences</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197269</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kate M.

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a key nuclear transcription factor, is associated with prognosis in a variety of human cancers. However, the clinical value of NF-κB in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still controversial. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to obtain an accurate evaluation of the relationship between NF-κB expression and survival prognosis of NSCLC patients based on published articles. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for potential articles. A total of 1159 patients from 7 eligible studies comparing prognostic significance of NF-κB expression levels in NSCLC were included in our meta-analysis. I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistic and P value were performed to evaluate heterogeneity. The results of analysis were presented as hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity of NSCLC patients and NF-kB cellular localization within cancer cells were conducted to illustrate the potential discrepancy. Significant heterogeneity was considered at I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&gt;50% and P&amp;lt;0.05, and random-effects model was used. The combined results indicated that higher NF-κB expression was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients (HR = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.51–5.12, P = 0.001). Moreover, NF-κB expression was closely associated with tumor stage (HR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.18–0.57, P&amp;lt;0.0001), lymph node metastasis (HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.38–0.83, P = 0.004) and 5-year OS for NSCLC patients (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.02–3.31, P = 0.04). We conclude that NF-κB expression may be a potential unfavorable prognostic marker for NSCLC patients.</content></content><updated>1527627600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><published>1527627600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Prognostic significance of &amp;lt;i&gt;NF-κB&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression in non-small cell lung cancer: A meta-analysis</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198223</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lijun Gu, Zhiyan Wang, Jing Zuo, Hongmei Li, Lin Zha&lt;/p&gt;

Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) offer an alternate means to consume nicotine in a variety of flavored aerosols. Data are needed to better understand the impact of flavors on use behavior. A natural environment observational study was conducted on experienced ENDS users to measure the effect of e-liquid flavor on topography and consumption behavior. The RIT wPUM&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; monitor was used to record to record the date and time and puff topography (flow rate, volume, duration) for every puff taken by N = 34 participants over the course of two weeks. All participants used tobacco flavor for one week, and either berry or menthol flavor for one week. Results provide strong evidence that flavor affects the topography behaviors of mean puff flow rate and mean puff volume, and there is insufficient evidence to support an influence of flavor on mean puff duration and mean puff interval. There was insufficient evidence, due to the low power associated with the limited number of observation days, to establish a relationship between flavor and cumulative consumption behavior. While the results indicate that an effect may be evident, additional observation days are required to establish significance.</content></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><published>1525294800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Effect of e-liquid flavor on electronic cigarette topography and consumption behavior in a 2-week natural environment switching study</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196640</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by R.

While the results indicate that an effect may be evident, additional observation days are required to establish significance.</description><fingerprint>34b2c7ba</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196640</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f0932f5:133cc2:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25386-9</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25386-9</link><author><name>Yi Liu</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a), Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25386-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25386-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a)&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/FtXjpO7QP_U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525770957557</crawled><published>1525762800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a)</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/FtXjpO7QP_U/s41598-018-25386-9</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a), Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25386-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25386-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a)&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/FtXjpO7QP_U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>6517c35f</fingerprint><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25386-9</href></item></canonical></item><item><engagement>116</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04283-9/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4283_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>574</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1634439b800:9d4c6f:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04283-9</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04283-9</link><author><name>Aled J.

The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of CPP-ACP and fluorides compared with fluorides monotherapy on patients with early caries lesions. The Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases up to August 2017 were scanned, with no restrictions. Studies satisfied the guideline of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the patients with early caries lesions and data considering the efficacy of fluorides and CPP-ACP versus fluorides alone were selected. There was no language restriction during the literature search process, however, only papers in English or Chinese were included during the selection process. Outcome variables include laser fluorescence, quantitative light-induced fluorescence, lesion area and visual inspection scores. Mean differences were calculated during the data extraction process. Ten studies including 559 patients were selected in the meta-analysis. Fluorides combined with CPP-ACP achieved the same efficacy for early caries lesions on smooth surfaces compared with fluorides monotherapy (mean difference: -13.90, 95% confidence interval: [-39.25, 11.46], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.28), and the combination treatment showed significantly better efficacy than fluorides monotherapy for occlusal early caries lesions (mean difference: -21.02, 95% confidence interval: [-27.94, -14.10], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).

Although studies from pediatric cancers (largely acute lymphoblastic leukemia) have shown that patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy may experience decreased growth velocity during the treatment phase, no such data exist for retinoblastoma patients treated with systemic chemotherapy or ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC). The purpose of this study is to report growth patterns of our retinoblastoma (Rb) population who were treated with OAC in a retrospective, single center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) review of 341 patients treated between 2006 and 2016. Children who only received OAC were classified as naive; those who were treated initially with systemic chemotherapy and subsequently presented to our center for OAC were termed secondary; and a small group of patients who received single-agent systemic chemotherapy prior to OAC were labeled bridge. For all patients, height and weight were recorded at monthly intervals during OAC (short-term) and then annually during a follow-up period (long-term) up to 3 years after treatment. Excluded from this study were children who received external radiation therapy and those with genetic syndromes, which are independently associated with growth derangements. During OAC, there was no significant difference in growth velocity between the naïve and secondary groups. In either group, number of treatments also did not affect growth rate. Three years after the end of OAC, naïve patients were in the 68&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile by height (95% CI 61.30, 74.63) compared to secondary patients in the 61&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 51.1, 71.47). Both groups were in the same weight percentiles during the first two years of follow-up but at the three-year follow-up period, naïve patients were in the 63&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 57.4, 69.4) and secondary patients were in the 60&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 50.4, 69.7). OAC for retinoblastoma does not appear to impact short-term growth velocity, weight gain during the treatment period or after three years.</content></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><published>1525726800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Growth patterns of survivors of retinoblastoma treated with ophthalmic artery chemosurgery</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197052</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sruti S.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to identify potential CpG site(s) or DNA methylation pattern(s) in the pseudo α-globin 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene), the gene which locates in α-thalassemia-1 deletion mutation, to differentiate plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;DNA methylation profiles of placenta and peripheral blood from the MethBase database were compared to screen differentially methylated regions. This region was confirmed the differential by methylation-sensitive high resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. The differential region was used to compare DNA methylation profile of plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women by bisulfite amplicon sequencing in three levels: overall, individual CpG sites and individual molecules (DNA methylation patterns).&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Using MethBase data, four consecutive CpG sites in the &lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene were identified as regions of differential DNA methylation between placenta and peripheral blood. The confirmation by MS-HRM showed the differential DNA methylation profile between the placenta and plasma from non-pregnant women. The comparison of DNA methylation profiles between the plasma of pregnant and non-pregnant women showed that, in the overall levels of the four CpG sites, DNA methylation of pregnant women was detected at lower levels than non-pregnant women. In the individual CpG site level, only the second CpG site showed differential DNA methylation between the groups. In the DNA methylation pattern level, there was no strongly significant differences in DNA methylation patterns between the pregnant and non-pregnant groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our result demonstrated that, in the plasma from pregnant women, only one of the four CpG sites displays a decrease in DNA methylation compared with non-pregnant women. It indicates that this CpG site might be useful for determining the presence or absence of fetal wild-type α-globin gene cluster allele in maternal plasma.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Decreased DNA methylation of a CpG site in the &amp;lt;i&gt;HBAP1&amp;lt;/i&gt; gene in plasma DNA from pregnant women</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198165</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tanapat Pangeson, Torpong Sanguansermsri, Khwanruedee Mahingsa, Phanchana Sanguansermsri&lt;/p&gt;

Avian embryos are among the most convenient and the primary representatives for the study of classical embryology. It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2°C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><published>1525899600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Characterizing early embryonic development of Brown Tsaiya Ducks (&amp;lt;i&gt;Anas platyrhynchos&amp;lt;/i&gt;) in comparison with Taiwan Country Chicken (&amp;lt;i&gt;Gallus gallus domestics&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196973</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chompunut Lumsangkul, Yang-Kwang Fan, Shen-Chang Chang, Jyh-Cherng Ju, Hsin-I.

To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.</description><fingerprint>118f9c95</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196973</link></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33b90:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/503-l?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>aa0d1cbe</fingerprint><author><name>Stern, P.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><published>1525369184000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Setting conscious perception alight</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/503.12.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/503-l?rss=1</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/503-l?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163506186b5:1e2a223:2835af05</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300277v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>cc41ee39</fingerprint><author><name>Teschendorff, A.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>There is an increased need for integrative analyses of multi-omic data.

Understanding the functional basis of auxin homeostasis requires knowledge about auxin biosynthesis, auxin transport and auxin catabolism genes, which is not always directly available despite the recent whole-genome sequencing of many plant species. Through sequence homology searches and phylogenetic analyses on a selection of 11 plant species with high-quality genome annotation, we identified the putative gene homologs involved in auxin biosynthesis, auxin catabolism and auxin transport pathways in carnation (&lt;i&gt;Dianthus caryophyllus&lt;/i&gt; L.). To deepen our knowledge of the regulatory events underlying auxin-mediated adventitious root formation in carnation stem cuttings, we used RNA-sequencing data to confirm the expression profiles of some auxin homeostasis genes during the rooting of two carnation cultivars with different rooting behaviors. We also confirmed the presence of several auxin-related metabolites in the stem cutting tissues. Our findings offer a comprehensive overview of auxin homeostasis genes in carnation and provide a solid foundation for further experiments investigating the role of auxin homeostasis in the regulation of adventitious root formation in carnation.</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A comprehensive phylogeny of auxin homeostasis genes involved in adventitious root formation in carnation stem cuttings</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196663</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Belén Sánchez-García, Sergio Ibáñez, Antonio Cano, Manuel Acosta, José Manuel Pérez-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;

Enniatins are common contaminants of food and feed and belong to the group of the “emerging” mycotoxins, which are produced by various &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species. Although a wide range of toxic effects, like antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and cytotoxic properties, have been described &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, so far, no cases of mycotoxicosis connected to enniatins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are reported. Among this group of mycotoxins, enniatin B and enniatin B1 are the most prevalent compounds and therefore are present in the human diet. Enniatins can reach systemic circulation, thus, the investigation of possible neurotoxic effects is of importance. Different cerebral cells were used to address effects on cell death having an impact on the blood-brain barrier. The influence of enniatin B and enniatin B1 on cellular viability was examined via Cell Counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) in three different cell types of the blood-brain barrier: porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1). CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to enniatin B (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.9 μM) and enniatin B1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.4 μM) than both endothelial cell types. In CCF-STTG1 cells, caspase-3 activation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were evaluated. Both compounds did not induce any LDH release and only enniatin B increased caspase-3 activity as a marker for apoptosis. The transport kinetics of enniatin B and enniatin B1 across the blood-brain barrier &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated using PBCEC, cultivated on Transwell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; filter inserts. Analysis of the apical and the basolateral compartment by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed high influx rates for enniatin B and enniatin B1.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) transplant has been reported to be a potential treatment for burn wounds. However, the effects of autogenicity and allogenicity of ADSCs on burn wound healing have not been investigated and the method for using ADSCs still needs to be established. This study compared the healing effects of autologous and allogenic ADSCs and determined an optimal method of using ADSCs to treat acute burn wounds. Experiments were performed in 20 male Wistar rats (weight, 176–250 g; age, 6–7 weeks). Two identical full-thickness burn wounds (radius, 4 mm) were created in each rat. ADSCs harvested from inguinal area and characterized by their high multipotency were injected into burn wounds in the original donor rats (autologous ADSCs group) or in other rats (allogenic ADSCs group). The injection site was either the wound center or the four corners 0.5 cm from the wound edge. The reduction of burn surface areas in the two experimental groups and in control group were evaluated with Image J software for 15 days post-wounding to determine the wound healing rates. Wound healing was significantly faster in the autologous ADSCs group compared to both the allogenic ADSCs group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;) and control group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;). Wound healing in the allogenic ADSC group did not significantly differ from that in control group.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) transplant has been reported to be a potential treatment for burn wounds. However, the effects of autogenicity and allogenicity of ADSCs on burn wound healing have not been investigated and the method for using ADSCs still needs to be established. This study compared the healing effects of autologous and allogenic ADSCs and determined an optimal method of using ADSCs to treat acute burn wounds. Experiments were performed in 20 male Wistar rats (weight, 176–250 g; age, 6–7 weeks). Two identical full-thickness burn wounds (radius, 4 mm) were created in each rat. ADSCs harvested from inguinal area and characterized by their high multipotency were injected into burn wounds in the original donor rats (autologous ADSCs group) or in other rats (allogenic ADSCs group). The injection site was either the wound center or the four corners 0.5 cm from the wound edge. The reduction of burn surface areas in the two experimental groups and in control group were evaluated with Image J software for 15 days post-wounding to determine the wound healing rates. Wound healing was significantly faster in the autologous ADSCs group compared to both the allogenic ADSCs group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;) and control group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;). Wound healing in the allogenic ADSC group did not significantly differ from that in control group. Notably, ADSC injections 0.5cm from the wound edge showed significantly improved healing compared to ADSCs injections in the wound center (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;). This study demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of ADSCs in treating acute burn wounds in rats. However, only autologous ADSCs improved healing in acute burn wounds; allogenic ADSCs did not. This study further determined a superior location of using ADSCs injections to treat burn wounds including the injection site.

Background/Aims &lt;p&gt;Typical approach for increasing apheresis platelet collections is to recruit new donors. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of an alternative strategy: optimizing donor scheduling, prior to recruitment, at a hospital-based blood donor center.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Analysis of collections, during the 89 consecutive months since opening of donor center, was performed. Linear regression and segmented time-series analyses were performed to calculate growth rates of collections and to test for statistical differences, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Pre-intervention donor scheduling capacity was 39/month. In the absence of active donor recruitment, during the first 29 months, the number of collections rose gradually to 24/month (growth-rate of 0.70/month). However, between month-30 and -55, collections exhibited a plateau at 25.6 ± 3.0 (growth-rate of -0.09/month) (p&amp;lt;0.0001). This plateau-phase coincided with donor schedule approaching saturation (65.6 ± 7.6% schedule booked). Scheduling capacity was increased by following two interventions: adding an apheresis instrument (month-56) and adding two more collection days/week (month-72). Consequently, the scheduling capacity increased to 130/month. Post-interventions, apheresis platelet collections between month-56 and -81 exhibited a spontaneous renewed growth at a rate of 0.62/month (p&amp;lt;0.0001), in absence of active donor recruitment. Active donor recruitment in month-82 and -86, when the donor schedule had been optimized to accommodate further growth, resulted in a dramatic but transient surge in collections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Apheresis platelet collections plateau at nearly 2/3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of the scheduling capacity.

Women’s groups practicing participatory learning and action (PLA) in rural areas have been shown to improve maternal and newborn survival in low-income countries, but the pathways from intervention to impact remain unclear. We assessed the long-term impact of a PLA intervention in rural Nepal on women’s agency in the household. In 2014, we conducted a follow-up study to a cluster randomised controlled trial on the impact of PLA women’s groups from 2001–2003. Agency was measured using the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) and its subdomains. Multi-level regression analyses were performed adjusting for baseline socio-demographic characteristics. We additionally adjusted for potential exposure to subsequent PLA groups based on women’s pregnancy status and conduct of PLA groups in areas of residence. Sensitivity analyses were performed using two alternative measures of agency. We analysed outcomes for 4030 mothers (66% of the cohort) who survived and were recruited to follow-up at mean age 39.6 years. Across a wide range of model specifications, we found no association between exposure to the original PLA intervention with women’s agency in the household approximately 11.5 years later. Subsequent exposure to PLA groups was not associated with greater agency in the household at follow-up, but some specifications found evidence for reduced agency. Household agency may be a prerequisite for actualising the benefits of PLA groups rather than a consequence.</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><published>1526331600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The long-term impact of community mobilisation through participatory women&apos;s groups on women&apos;s agency in the household: A follow-up study to the Makwanpur trial</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197426</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lu Gram, Jolene Skordis-Worrall, Dharma S.

Extensive antibiotic use over the years has led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to public health since for many infections antibiotic treatment is no longer effective. Hospitals are focal points for ARB spread. Antibiotic use in hospitals exerts selective pressure, accelerating the spread of ARB. We used an agent-based model to explore the impact of antibiotics on the transmission dynamics and to examine the potential of stewardship interventions in limiting ARB spread in a hospital. Agents in the model consist of patients and health care workers (HCW). The transmission of ARB occurs through contacts between patients and HCW and between adjacent patients. In the model, antibiotic use affects the risk of transmission by increasing the vulnerability of susceptible patients and the contagiousness of colonized patients who are treated with antibiotics. The model shows that increasing the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics increases the rate of acquisition non-linearly. The effect of antibiotics on the spread of resistance depends on characteristics of the antibiotic agent and the density of antibiotic use. Antibiotic&apos;s impact on the spread increases when the bacterial strain is more transmissible, and decreases as resistance prevalence rises. The individual risk for acquiring ARB increases in parallel with antibiotic density both for patients treated and not treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment in the hospital setting plays an important role in determining the spread of resistance. Interventions to limit antibiotic use have the potential to reduce the spread of resistance, mainly by choosing an agent with a favorable profile in terms of its impact on patient&apos;s vulnerability and contagiousness. Methods to measure these impacts of antibiotics should be developed, standardized, and incorporated into drug development programs and approval packages.</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><published>1526331600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The impact of antibiotic use on transmission of resistant bacteria in hospitals: Insights from an agent-based model</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197111</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonatan Almagor, Elizabeth Temkin, Itzhak Benenson, Noga Fallach, Yehuda Carmeli, on behalf of the DRIVE-AB consortium &lt;/p&gt;

The effect of antibiotics on the spread of resistance depends on characteristics of the antibiotic agent and the density of antibiotic use. Antibiotic&apos;s impact on the spread increases when the bacterial strain is more transmissible, and decreases as resistance prevalence rises. The individual risk for acquiring ARB increases in parallel with antibiotic density both for patients treated and not treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment in the hospital setting plays an important role in determining the spread of resistance. Interventions to limit antibiotic use have the potential to reduce the spread of resistance, mainly by choosing an agent with a favorable profile in terms of its impact on patient&apos;s vulnerability and contagiousness. Methods to measure these impacts of antibiotics should be developed, standardized, and incorporated into drug development programs and approval packages.</description><fingerprint>239aec5f</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197111</link></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16368e2285f:3fa1a1d:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05150-9</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05150-9</link><author><name>Sebastian Olbrich</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05150-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05150-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526473042015</crawled><published>1526454000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Treating brainwaves is not an option</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05150-9</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>bcef6c3f</fingerprint><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05150-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05150-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Treating brainwaves is not an option</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16345938dc6:c788ad:2835af05</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/316976v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>d7a57727</fingerprint><author><name>Garcia, M.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Summary: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a cornerstone of precision medicine, but portable and reproducible open-source workflows for WGS analyses of germline and somatic variants are lacking.

While previous work has shown that the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification is a useful, though subjective, feature for predicting surgical outcomes, obtaining this classification requires a clinician to review the patient&apos;s medical records. Our goal here is to create an improved risk score using electronic medical records and demonstrate its utility in predicting in-hospital mortality without requiring clinician-derived ASA scores. Methods: Data from 49,513 surgical patients were used to train logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted tree classifiers for predicting in-hospital mortality. The features used are readily available before surgery from EMR databases. A gradient boosted tree regression model was trained to impute the ASA Physical Status Classification, and this new, imputed score was included as an additional feature to preoperatively predict in-hospital post-surgical mortality. The preoperative risk prediction was then used as an input feature to a deep neural network (DNN), along with intraoperative features, to predict postoperative in-hospital mortality risk. Performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: We found that the random forest classifier (AUC 0.921, 95%CI 0.908-0.934) outperforms logistic regression (AUC 0.871, 95%CI 0.841-0.900) and gradient boosted trees (AUC 0.897, 95%CI 0.881-0.912) in predicting in-hospital post-surgical mortality. Using logistic regression, the ASA Physical Status Classification score alone had an AUC of 0.865 (95%CI 0.848-0.882). Adding preoperative features to the ASA Physical Status Classification improved the random forest AUC to 0.929 (95%CI 0.915-0.943). Using only automatically obtained preoperative features with no clinician intervention, we found that the random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.921 (95%CI 0.908-0.934). Integrating the preoperative risk prediction into the DNN for postoperative risk prediction results in an AUC of 0.924 (95%CI 0.905-0.941), and with both a preoperative and postoperative risk score for each patient, we were able to show that the mortality risk changes over time. Conclusions: Features easily extracted from EMR data can be used to preoperatively predict the risk of in-hospital post-surgical mortality in a fully automated fashion, with accuracy comparable to models trained on features that require clinical expertise. This preoperative risk score can then be compared to the postoperative risk score to show that the risk changes, and therefore should be monitored longitudinally over time.</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527257340872</crawled><published>1527231600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Preoperative predictions of in-hospital mortality using electronic medical record data [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329813v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><description>Background: Predicting preoperative in-hospital mortality using readily-available electronic medical record (EMR) data can aid clinicians in accurately and rapidly determining surgical risk.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;California’s Workers’ Compensation System (CAWCS) Department of Industrial Relations questioned the adequacy of the current Medi-Cal fee-schedule pricing and requested analysis of alternatives that maximize price availability and maintain budget neutrality.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To compare CAWCS pharmacy-dispensed (PD) drug prices under alternative fee schedules, and identify combinations of alternative benchmarks that have prices available for the largest percentage of PD drugs and that best reach budget neutrality.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Claims transaction-level data (2011–2013) from CAWCS were used to estimate total annual PD pharmaceutical payments. Medi-Cal pricing data was from the Workman’s Compensation Insurance System (WCIS). Average Wholesale Prices (AWP), Wholesale Acquisition Costs (WAC), Direct Prices (DP), Federal Upper Limit (FUL) prices, and National Average Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC) were from Medi-Span. We matched National Drug Codes (NDCs), pricing dates, and drug quantity for comparisons. We report pharmacy-dispensed (PD) claims frequency, reimbursement matching rate, and paid costs by CAWCS as the reference price against all alternative price benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 12,529,977 CAWCS claims for pharmaceutical products 11.6% (1,462,814) were for PD drugs. Prescription drug cost for CAWCS was over $152M; $63.9M, $47.9M, and $40.6M in 2011–2013. Ninety seven percent of these CAWCS PD claims had a Medi-Cal price. Alternative mechanisms provided a price for fewer claims; NADAC 94.23%, AWP 90.94%, FUL 73.11%, WAC 66.98%, and DP 14.33%. Among CAWCS drugs with no Medi-Cal price in PD claims, AWP, WAC, NADAC, DP, and FUL provided prices for 96.7%, 63.14%, 24.82%, 20.83%, and 15.08% of claims. Overall CAWCS paid 100.52% of Medi-Cal, 60% of AWP, 97% of WAC, 309.53% of FUL, 103.83% of DP, and 136.27% of NADAC.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CAWCS current Medi-Cal fee-schedule price list for PD drugs is more complete than all alternative fee-schedules. However, all reimbursement approaches would require combinations of pricing benchmarks. We suggest keeping primary reimbursement at 100% of Medi-Cal and for drugs without a primary Medi-Cal price calculating the maximum fee as 60% of AWP and then 97% of WAC. Alternatively, we suggest using NADAC as a primary fee-schedule followed by either 60% AWP and 97% WAC or AWP-40% for drugs with no NADAC price. Fee-schedules may not offer the best price and a formulary approach may provide more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527282000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><published>1527282000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The impact of alternative pricing methods for drugs in California Workers’ Compensation System: Fee-schedule pricing</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197449</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leslie Wilson, Fatema A.

Human alveolar macrophages (HAM) are primary bacterial niche and immune response cells during &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb)&lt;/i&gt; infection, and human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are a model for investigating &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt;-macrophage interactions. Here, we use a targeted RNA-Seq method to measure transcriptome-wide changes in RNA expression patterns of freshly obtained HAM (used within 6 h) and 6 day cultured MDM upon &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; infection over time (2, 24 and 72 h), in both uninfected and infected cells from three donors each. The Ion AmpliSeq™ Transcriptome Human Gene Expression Kit (AmpliSeq) uses primers targeting 18,574 mRNAs and 2,228 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) for a total of 20,802 transcripts. AmpliSeq&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; yields highly precise and reproducible gene expression profiles (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt;0.99). Taking advantage of AmpliSeq’s reproducibility, we establish well-defined quantitative RNA expression patterns of HAM &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; MDM, including significant &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb-&lt;/i&gt;inducible genes, in networks and pathways that differ in part between MDM and HAM. A similar number of expressed genes are detected at all time-points between uninfected MDM and HAM, in common pathways including inflammatory and immune functions, but canonical pathway differences also exist. In particular, at 2 h, multiple genes relevant to the immune response are preferentially expressed in either uninfected HAM or MDM, while the HAM RNA profiles approximate MDM profiles over time in culture, highlighting the unique RNA expression profile of freshly obtained HAM. MDM demonstrate a greater transcriptional response than HAM upon &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; infection, with 2 to &gt;10 times more genes up- or down-regulated. The results identify key genes involved in cellular responses to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; in two different human macrophage types. Follow-up bioinformatics analysis indicates that approximately 30% of response genes have expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs in GTEx), common DNA variants that can influence host gene expression susceptibility or resistance to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt;, illustrated with the &lt;i&gt;TREM1&lt;/i&gt; gene cluster and &lt;i&gt;IL-10&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><published>1527714000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>AmpliSeq transcriptome analysis of human alveolar and monocyte-derived macrophages over time in response to &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&amp;lt;/i&gt; infection</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198221</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>3bc35416</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Audrey C.

In particular, at 2 h, multiple genes relevant to the immune response are preferentially expressed in either uninfected HAM or MDM, while the HAM RNA profiles approximate MDM profiles over time in culture, highlighting the unique RNA expression profile of freshly obtained HAM. MDM demonstrate a greater transcriptional response than HAM upon &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; infection, with 2 to &gt;10 times more genes up- or down-regulated. The results identify key genes involved in cellular responses to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; in two different human macrophage types. Follow-up bioinformatics analysis indicates that approximately 30% of response genes have expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs in GTEx), common DNA variants that can influence host gene expression susceptibility or resistance to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt;, illustrated with the &lt;i&gt;TREM1&lt;/i&gt; gene cluster and &lt;i&gt;IL-10&lt;/i&gt;.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26422-4/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26422_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>501</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163b0561ee5:256d7e1:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26422-4</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26422-4</link><author><name>A.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The aims of the study were to identify the associations between multimorbidity and specific physical function domains among community-dwelling adults in Singapore, and to examine sex differences in the associations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted using baseline data of 1,940 participants in the Population Health Index Survey conducted in the Central Region of Singapore from November 2015 to November 2016. Physical function was assessed using the Function Component of the Late-life Function and Disability Instrument and compared between men and women. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to examine associations between multimorbidity and different physical function domains for all participants, and in men and women separately.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of multimorbidity in the study population was 35.0% for adults aged 21 years and above, with no differences between men and women. Multimorbidity was associated with reduced upper extremity function, basic and advanced lower extremity function, and overall function in men and women after adjusting for demographic factors. Multimorbidity had a stronger association with advanced lower extremity function and overall physical function in women than in men.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The findings of this study indicate that multimorbidity is associated with physical function domains in men and women, and in particular advanced lower extremity for women. Effective community-based interventions need to be implemented to preserve physical function in individuals with multimorbidity to keep them functionally independent and physically active in the community.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Self-reported tobacco use in the United Arab Emirates is among the highest in the region. Use of tobacco products other than cigarettes is widespread, but little is known about specific behavior use patterns. There have been no studies that have biochemically verified smoking status.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The UAE Healthy Future Study (UAEHFS) seeks to understand the causes of non-communicable diseases through a 20,000-person cohort study. During the study pilot, 517 Emirati nationals were recruited to complete a questionnaire, provide clinical measurements and biological samples. Complete smoking data were available for 428 participants. Validation of smoking status via cotinine testing was conducted based on complete questionnaire data and matching urine samples for 399 participants, using a cut-off of 200ng/ml to indicate active smoking status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Self-reported tobacco use was 36% among men and 3% among women in the sample. However, biochemical verification of smoking status revealed that 42% men and 9% of women were positive for cotinine indicating possible recent tobacco use. Dual and poly-use of tobacco products was fairly common with 32% and 6% of the sample reporting respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This is the first study in the region to biochemically verify tobacco use self-report data. Tobacco use in this study population was found to be higher than previously thought, especially among women. Misclassification of smoking status was more common than expected. Poly-tobacco use was also very common.

The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526060694416</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/k59-VYZP8r0/article</href></item></alternate><published>1526072400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Hey1- and p53-dependent TrkC proapoptotic activity controls neuroblastoma growth</title><recrawled>1526060763996</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Ménard, Clélia Costechareyre, Gabriel Ichim, Jonathan Blachier, David Neves, Loraine Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Reinhard Depping, Jan Koster, Pierre Saintigny, Patrick Mehlen, Servane Tauszig-Delamasure&lt;/p&gt;

Loss of integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in ischemic stroke victims initiates a devastating cascade of events causing brain damage. Maintaining the BBB is important to preserve brain function in ischemic stroke. Unfortunately, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only effective fibrinolytic treatment at the acute stage of ischemic stroke, also injures the BBB and increases the risk of brain edema and secondary hemorrhagic transformation. Thus, it is important to identify compounds that maintain BBB integrity in the face of ischemic injury in patients with stroke. We previously demonstrated that intravenously injected phosphorylated recombinant heat shock protein 27 (prHSP27) protects the brains of mice with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), an animal stroke-model. Here, we determined whether prHSP27, in addition to attenuating brain injury, also decreases BBB damage in hyperglycemic tMCAO mice that had received tPA. After induction of hyperglycemia and tMCAO, we examined 4 treatment groups: 1) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2) prHSP27, 3) tPA, 4) tPA plus prHSP27. We examined the effects of prHSP27 by comparing the BSA and prHSP27 groups and the tPA and tPA plus prHSP27 groups. Twenty-four hours after injection, prHSP27 reduced infarct volume, brain swelling, neurological deficits, the loss of microvessel proteins and endothelial cell walls, and mortality. It also reduced the rates of hemorrhagic transformation, extravasation of endogenous IgG, and MMP-9 activity, signs of BBB damage. Therefore, prHSP27 injection attenuated brain damage and preserved the BBB in tPA-injected, hyperglycemic tMCAO experimental stroke-model mice, in which the BBB is even more severely damaged than in simple tMCAO mice. The attenuation of brain damage and BBB disruption in the presence of tPA suggests the effectiveness of prHSP27 and tPA as a combination therapy. prHSP27 may be a novel therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke patients whose BBBs are injured following tPA injections.</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Phosphorylated recombinant HSP27 protects the brain and attenuates blood-brain barrier disruption following stroke in mice receiving intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198039</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoshiaki Shimada, Hideki Shimura, Ryota Tanaka, Kazuo Yamashiro, Masato Koike, Yasuo Uchiyama, Takao Urabe, Nobutaka Hattori&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;In airway epithelium, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22) are induced by defective epithelial barriers such as E-cadherin and attract the effector cells of Th2 immunity. However, the association between the epithelial barrier and CCL17 expression has not been studied in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). Thus, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CCL17 and its regulation by Th cytokines in nasal polyp (NP) epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The expression and distribution of CCL17, CCL22, E-cadherin and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were measured using real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry and compared between normal ethmoid sinus epithelium and NP epithelium. In addition, the expression level of CCL17 was determined in cultured epithelial cells treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The expression of CCL17 was decreased in the NP epithelium compared to the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus, whereas the expression of CCL22 was not decreased. E-cadherin was differentially distributed between the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus and NP epithelium. EGFR was also decreased in NPs. Interestingly, the stimulation of cultured epithelial cells with Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, resulted in an upregulation of CCL17 expression only in NP epithelial cells whereas the expression of CCL17 was increased in both normal epithelial cells and NP epithelial cells by Th1 cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decreased expression of CCL17 in defective NP epithelium may be closely connected to NP pathogenesis and can be differentially regulated by cytokines in the NP epithelium of patients with CRSwNP.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Decreased expression of CCL17 in the disrupted nasal polyp epithelium and its regulation by IL-4 and IL-5</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197355</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byoungjae Kim, Hyun-Ji Lee, Nu-Ri Im, Doh Young Lee, Ha Kyun Kim, Cha Young Kang, Il-Ho Park, Seung Hoon Lee, Heung-Man Lee, Sang Hag Lee, Seung-Kuk Baek, Tae Hoon Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526936400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526924658806</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bABG40KQDFw/article</href></item></alternate><published>1526936400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Implications for human odor sensing revealed from the statistics of odorant-receptor interactions</title><recrawled>1526935325513</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Hyun Bak, Seogjoo J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8) can cause Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) in immunosuppressed individuals. However, little is known about the association between chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), circulating HHV8 DNA levels, and clinical KS in HIV-1-infected individuals with various malignancies. Therefore, we examined the associations between various malignancies, systemic cancer chemotherapy, T cell phenotypes, and circulating HHV8 DNA in 29 HIV-1-infected participants with concomitant KS or other cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We quantified HHV8 plasma viral loads and cell-associated HHV8 DNA and determined the relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and lymphocyte counts, and markers of early and late lymphocyte activation, proliferation and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences in plasma HHV8 DNA levels between baseline and post-chemotherapy time points or with the presence or absence of clinical KS. However, in two participants circulating HHV8 DNA increased following treatment for KS or HSCT for lymphoma,. We observed an approximately 2-log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in plasma HHV8 DNA in an individual with KS and multicentric Castleman disease following rituximab monotherapy. Although individuals with clinical KS had lower mean CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell counts and percentages as expected, there were no significant associations with these factors and plasma HHV8 levels. We identified increased proportions of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells expressing CD69 (P = 0.01 &amp;amp; P = 0.04 respectively), and increased CD57 expression on CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells (P = 0.003) in participants with detectable HHV8.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest there is a complex relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and tissue-based disease in HIV-1 and HHV8 co-infected individuals with various malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Human Herpes Virus 8 in HIV-1 infected individuals receiving cancer chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197298</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Louise E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Developing more effective strategies to prevent relapse remains one of the major challenges of treating substance dependence. Previous studies have identified brain abnormalities in abstinent alcoholics. However, whether these persistent brain deficits in abstinence could predict early relapse to alcohol use has not been well established. This study aimed to identify biomarkers of relapse vulnerability by investigating persistent brain abnormalities in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Brain imaging and impulsive behavior data were collected from 56 abstinent alcohol-dependent male inpatients and 33 age-matched male healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the differences of grey matter volume between the groups. The resting-state functional connectivity was examined using brain areas with gray matter deficits as seed regions. A preliminary prospective study design was used to classify patients into abstainers and relapsers after a 62-day average abstinence period.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared with healthy controls, both relapsers and abstainers exhibited significantly reduced gray matter volume in the cuneus. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that relapsers relative to abstainers demonstrated increased cuneus-centered negative functional connectivity within a network of brain regions which are involved in executive control and salience. Abnormal gray matter volume in the left cuneus and the functional connectivity between the right cuneus and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could successfully predict relapse during the 3-month follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that the abnormal gray matter volume in the cuneus and resting-state cuneus-prefrontal functional connectivity may play an important role in poor treatment outcomes in alcoholics and serve as useful neural markers of relapse vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><published>1525726800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Combining gray matter volume in the cuneus and the cuneus-prefrontal connectivity may predict early relapse in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196860</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junkai Wang, Yunli Fan, Yue Dong, Mengying Ma, Yuru Dong, Yajuan Niu, Yin Jiang, Hong Wang, Zhiyan Wang, Liuzhen Wu, Hongqiang Sun, Cailian Cui&lt;/p&gt;

Based on the feature relationship, accordingly, we further present LGC, a novel algorithm for identifying lncRNAs that is able to accurately distinguish lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs in a cross-species manner without any prior knowledge. As validated on large-scale empirical datasets, comparative results show that LGC outperforms existing algorithms by achieving higher accuracy, well-balanced sensitivity and specificity, and is robustly effective (&gt;90% accuracy) in discriminating lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs across diverse species that range from plants to mammals. To our knowledge, this study, for the first time, differentially characterizes lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship, which is further applied in computational identification of lncRNAs.

Taken together, our study represents a significant advance in characterization and identification of lncRNAs and LGC thus bears broad potential utility for computational analysis of lncRNAs in a wide range of species.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/23/327882</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327882v1?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1638809cb39:6ecd9f6:2835af05</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37641</originId><fingerprint>6a7565ea</fingerprint><author><name>bjoern.petersen@fli.de (Björn Petersen)</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Genetically engineered pigs that digest their food better could help to reduce phosphorus and nitrogen pollution.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526995733305</crawled><published>1526947200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Transgenic pigs to the rescue</title><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37641</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37641</href></item></alternate><description>Genetically engineered pigs that digest their food better could help to reduce phosphorus and nitrogen pollution.</description><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item><item>Microbiology and Infectious Disease</item></keywords><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37641</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163932c58a5:7fe83e1:93d646dc</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329714v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>c6515471</fingerprint><author><name>Lieven, C.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Genome-scale metabolic models allow researchers to calculate yields, to predict consumption and production rates, and to study the effect of genetic modifications in silico, without running resource-intensive experiments.

Referral from other hospitals was an environmental risk factor that deserves further study.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>cf11c47c</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198212</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/20/E4594/F2.medium.gif</url><height>238</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16364ca7c57:39f3a41:93d646dc</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4594.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4594</canonicalUrl><author><name>Mackenzie J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common in adults. People with OSAS have a higher risk of experiencing traffic accidents and occupational injuries (OIs). We aimed to clarify the diagnostic performance of a three-channel screening device (ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) compared with the gold standard of full-night attended polysomnography (PSG) among hospital outpatients not referred for sleep-related symptoms. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether manual revision of the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore enhanced diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We investigated 68 patients with OI and 44 without OI recruited from the University Hospital Basel emergency room, using a cross-sectional study design. Participating patients spent one night at home with ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and within 2 weeks slept for one night at the sleep laboratory. We reanalyzed all ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; data after manual revision.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified significant correlations between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) autoscore and the AHI derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.525; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) autoscore and that derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.722; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore showed a sensitivity and specificity of 82% when comparing AHI ≥5 with the cutoff for AHI and/or ODI ≥15 from PSG. In Bland Altman plots the mean difference between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore and PSG was 2.75 with SD ± 8.80 (β = 0.034), and between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI revised score and PSG -1.50 with SD ± 9.28 (β = 0.060).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity compared with the gold standard (full-night attended PSG). However, Bland Altman plots revealed substantial fluctuations between PSG and ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore respectively manually revised score. This spread for the AHI from a clinical perspective is large, and therefore the results have to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, our findings suggest that there is no clinical benefit in manually revising the ApneaLinkTM autoscore.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><published>1527714000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Screening for obstructive sleep apnea among hospital outpatients</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198315</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>fabc39ca</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michel Hug, Katrin Uehli, Stig Solbach, Stefanie Brighenti-Zogg, Selina Dürr, Sabrina Maier, Jörg Daniel Leuppi, David Miedinger&lt;/p&gt;

A common goal in data-analysis is to sift through a large data-matrix and detect any significant submatrices (i.e., biclusters) that have a low numerical rank. We present a simple algorithm for tackling this biclustering problem. Our algorithm accumulates information about 2-by-2 submatrices (i.e., ‘loops’) within the data-matrix, and focuses on rows and columns of the data-matrix that participate in an abundance of low-rank loops. We demonstrate, through analysis and numerical-experiments, that this loop-counting method performs well in a variety of scenarios, outperforming simple spectral methods in many situations of interest. Another important feature of our method is that it can easily be modified to account for aspects of experimental design which commonly arise in practice. For example, our algorithm can be modified to correct for controls, categorical- and continuous-covariates, as well as sparsity within the data. We demonstrate these practical features with two examples; the first drawn from gene-expression analysis and the second drawn from a much larger genome-wide-association-study (GWAS).&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbY469xyEU0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526320580725</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/MbY469xyEU0/article</href></item></alternate><published>1526331600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A loop-counting method for covariate-corrected low-rank biclustering of gene-expression and genome-wide association study data</title><recrawled>1526330530080</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aaditya V.

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critical to adaptive immune defence mechanisms in vertebrate species and are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Polymorphic sites are located close to the ligand-binding groove and entail MHC-I alleles with distinct binding specificities. Some efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between polymorphism and protein stability. However, less is known about the relationship between polymorphism and MHC-I co-evolutionary constraints. Using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pinpoints structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by cross-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability. These results suggest that sites displaying high polymorphism may also have been selected during vertebrates’ evolution to avoid those under co-evolutionary constraints and thereby maximize their mutability.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5R4fGWtz6gQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526936400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526935170348</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5R4fGWtz6gQ/article</href></item></alternate><published>1526936400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Polymorphic sites preferentially avoid co-evolving residues in MHC class I proteins</title><recrawled>1526935325513</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Dib, Nicolas Salamin, David Gfeller&lt;/p&gt;
