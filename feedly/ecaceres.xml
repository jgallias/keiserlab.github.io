Over the last decades, the treatment of schizophrenia has shifted fundamentally from a focus on symptom reduction to a focus on recovery and improving aspects of functioning. In this study, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on social cognitive and nonsocial neurocognitive functions, as well as on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures, in individuals with schizophrenia. Thirty-seven individuals with schizophrenia were administered one of three different tDCS conditions (cathodal, anodal, and sham) per visit over the course of three visits, with approximately one week between each visit. Order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. For the active conditions, the electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the reference electrode over right supraorbital cortex. Current intensity was 2 mA and was maintained for two 20-minute sessions, with a one hour break between the sessions. Assessments were conducted immediately following each session, in a counterbalanced order of administration. No systematic effects were found across the social and nonsocial cognitive domains, and no significant effects were detected on event-related potentials (ERPs). The very small effect sizes, further validated by &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; power analyses (large Critical Ns), demonstrated that these findings were not due to lack of statistical power. Except for mild local discomfort, no significant side effects were reported. Findings demonstrate the safety and ease of administration of this procedure, but suggest that a single dose of tDCS over these areas does not yield a therapeutic effect on cognition in schizophrenia.

The biological impetus for gene dosage and allele specificity of mammalian imprinted genes is not fully understood. To address this, we generated and analyzed four sets of mice from a single breeding scheme with varying allelic expression and gene dosage of the &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; domain. The mutants with abrogation of the two paternally expressed genes, &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt;, showed a significant decrease in growth rates for both males and females, while the mutants with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; resulted in an increased growth rate of female mice only. The mutant cohort with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; tended to have greater numbers of pups compared to the other genotypes. The mutants with switched active alleles displayed overall similar phenotypes to the wild type, but did show some differences in gene expression, suggesting potential non-redundant roles contributed by the maternal and paternal alleles. Overall, this study demonstrates a novel &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; approach to investigate the allele and dosage specificity of mammalian imprinted domains.</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197069</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Allele and dosage specificity of the &amp;lt;i&gt;Peg3&amp;lt;/i&gt; imprinted domain</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Corey L.

&lt;i&gt;Arachis hypogaea&lt;/i&gt; L. geocarpy is a unique feature different from other legume plants. Flowering and fertilization occur above ground, while the following processes of pod formation and development proceed in the soil. The zygote divides only few times to develop into pre-embryo and then further embryo developmental process stops when the gynoecium is exposed to light condition or normal day/night period. In this study, eight phytochrome genes were identified in two wild peanuts (four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis ipaensis&lt;/i&gt;). Using RACE and homologous cloning, the full CDS of &lt;i&gt;AhphyA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyA-like&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AhphyE&lt;/i&gt; were acquired in cultivated peanut. Protein structure analysis showed that the conservative coding domains of phytochromes from a number of other plant species were found in these proteins. The C-terminal of AhphyA, AhphyA-like and AhphyB could interact with phytochrome-interacting factor 3 in vitro. The expression patterns of these genes in various tissues were analyzed by qRT-PCR, and significant differences were observed. Interestingly, the expression levels of &lt;i&gt;AhphyA-like&lt;/i&gt; changed significantly during gynophore growth and early pod development. Furthermore, protein accumulation patterns of AhphyA and AhphyB in gynophore were different during early pod development stages in that AhphyA and AhphyB proteins were not detected in S1 and S2 gynophores, while significant accumulation of AhphyA and AhphyB were detected in S3 gynophore. These results provided evidence that phytochromes mediated light signal transduction may play key roles in peanut geocarpy development.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198041</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Characterization of peanut phytochromes and their possible regulating roles in early peanut pod development</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ye Zhang, Jinbo Sun, Han Xia, Chuanzhi Zhao, Lei Hou, Baoshan Wang, Aiqin Li, Min Chen, Shuzhen Zhao, Xingjun Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Our data suggest a proepileptic role of pannexin-1 channels in chronic epilepsy in human patients and that pannexin-1 channel inhibition might represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for treating lesional and drug-resistant epilepsies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>[Research Articles] Pannexin-1 channels contribute to seizure generation in human epileptic brain tissue and in a mouse model of epilepsy</title><origin><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Dossi, E., Blauwblomme, T., Moulard, J., Chever, O., Vasile, F., Guinard, E., Le Bert, M., Couillin, I., Pallud, J., Capelle, L., Huberfeld, G., Rouach, N.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/443/eaar3796.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/443/eaar3796?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526069830582</crawled><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_16350d9a3b6:1e30482:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0117-1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Genome-wide association study of delay discounting in 23,217 adult research participants of European ancestry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Genome-wide association study of delay discounting in 23,217 adult research participants of European ancestry, Published online: 11 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0117-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0117-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Genome-wide association study of delay discounting in 23,217 adult research participants of European ancestry</description><published>1526022000000</published><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0117-1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Genome-wide association study of delay discounting in 23,217 adult research participants of European ancestry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Genome-wide association study of delay discounting in 23,217 adult research participants of European ancestry, Published online: 11 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0117-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0117-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Genome-wide association study of delay discounting in 23,217 adult research participants of European ancestry</content></content><title>Publisher Correction: Genome-wide association study of delay discounting in 23,217 adult research participants of European ancestry</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Nature Neuroscience</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><author><name>Sandra Sanchez-Roige</name></author><fingerprint>24aa4991</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0117-1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1525807602634</crawled><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16341385bca:541328:93d646dc</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4318.short?rss=1</originId><description>With great enthusiasm, I read the PNAS article by Palmer et al. entitled “Thymic involution and rising disease incidence with age” (1).

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the thickness of retinal layers and association with final visual acuity using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in macular area of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients after a successful macular re-attachment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In retrospective study, a total 24 eyes with macula-off RRD were enrolled. All patients underwent vitrectomy to repair RRD. Outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptor layer (PR), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thicknesses were measured by the Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) SD-OCT with automated segmentation software. The relationship between the thicknesses of each retinal layer and postoperative logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution scale (LogMAR) visual acuity was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;OPL and RPE thicknesses were not significantly different between the retinal detachment eyes and fellow eyes (P = 0.839, 0.999, respectively). The ONL and photoreceptor thickness were significantly thinner in the retinal detachment eyes (P &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.001, respectively). In the univariate regression analysis, preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ONL thickness and photoreceptor thickness showed association with the postoperative BCVA (P = 0.003, &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.024, respectively). In final multiple linear regression model, ONL thickness was the only variable significantly associated with postoperative BCVA (P = 0.044).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Segmented ONL and photoreceptor thickness of retinal detachment eyes were significantly thinner than fellow eyes. Segmental analysis of the retinal layer in macular region may provide valuable information for evaluation RRD. And ONL thickness can be used as a potential biomarker to predict visual outcome after RRD repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197058</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Optical coherence tomography automated layer segmentation of macula after retinal detachment repair</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kyu Jin Han, Young Hoon Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Clinical data suggest that the neuroendocrine stress response is chronically dysregulated in a subset of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), potentially contributing to both disease progression and the development of psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. Whether neuroendocrine dysregulation and psychiatric comorbidities reflect direct effects of epilepsy-related pathologies, or secondary effects of disease burden particular to humans with epilepsy (i.e. social estrangement, employment changes) is not clear. Animal models provide an opportunity to dissociate these factors. Therefore, we queried whether epileptic mice would reproduce neuroendocrine and behavioral changes associated with human epilepsy. Male FVB mice were exposed to pilocarpine to induce status epilepticus (SE) and the subsequent development of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Morning baseline corticosterone levels were elevated in pilocarpine treated mice at 1, 7 and 10 weeks post-SE relative to controls. Similarly, epileptic mice had increased adrenal weight when compared to control mice. Exposure to acute restraint stress resulted in hypersecretion of corticosterone 30 min after the onset of the challenge. Anatomical analyses revealed reduced Fos expression in infralimbic and prelimbic prefrontal cortex, ventral subiculum and basal amygdala following restraint. No differences in Fos immunoreactivity were found in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, hippocampal subfields or central amygdala. In order to assess emotional behavior, a second cohort of mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests, including sucrose preference, open field, elevated plus maze, 24h home-cage monitoring and forced swim. Epileptic mice showed increased anhedonic behavior, hyperactivity and anxiety-like behaviors. Together these data demonstrate that epileptic mice develop HPA axis hyperactivity and exhibit behavioral dysfunction. Endocrine and behavioral changes are associated with impaired recruitment of forebrain circuits regulating stress inhibition and emotional reactivity. Loss of forebrain control may underlie pronounced endocrine dysfunction and comorbid psychopathologies seen in temporal lobe epilepsy.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197955</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Functional disruption of stress modulatory circuits in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aynara C.

Leopard seals are an important Antarctic apex predator that can affect marine ecosystems through local predation. Here we report on the successful use of micro geolocation logging sensor tags to track the movements, and activity, of four leopard seals for trips of between 142–446 days including one individual in two separate years. Whilst the sample size is small the results represent an advance in our limited knowledge of leopard seals. We show the longest periods of tracking of leopard seals’ migratory behaviour between the pack ice, close to the Antarctic continent, and the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. It appears that these tracked animals migrate in a directed manner towards Bird Island and, during their residency, use this as a central place for foraging trips as well as exploiting the local penguin and seal populations. Movements to the South Orkney Islands were also recorded, similar to those observed in other predators in the region including the krill fishery. Analysis of habitat associations, taking into account location errors, indicated the tracked seals had an affinity for shallow shelf water and regions of sea ice. Wet and dry sensors revealed that seals hauled out for between 22 and 31% of the time with maximum of 74 hours and a median of between 9 and 11 hours. The longest period a seal remained in the water was between 13 and 25 days. Fitting GAMMs showed that haul out rates changed throughout the year with the highest values occurring during the summer which has implications for visual surveys. Peak haul out occurred around midday for the months between October and April but was more evenly spread across the day between May and September. The seals’ movements between, and behaviour within, areas important to breeding populations of birds and other seals, coupled with the dynamics of the region’s fisheries, shows an understanding of leopard seal ecology is vital in the management of the Southern Ocean resources.</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Long term movements and activity patterns of an Antarctic marine apex predator: The leopard seal</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Iain J.

Attempts to reduce this redundancy have focused on visualizing pathway overlap or merging pathways, but the resulting pathways may be of heterogeneous sizes and cover multiple biological functions. Efforts have also been made to deal with redundancy in pathway data by consolidating enriched pathways into a number of clusters or concepts. We present an alternative approach, which generates pathway subsets capable of covering all of genes presented within either pathway databases or enrichment results, generating substantial reductions in redundancy. Results: We propose a method that uses set cover to reduce pathway redundancy, without merging pathways. The proposed approach considers three objectives: removal of pathway redundancy, controlling pathway size and coverage of the gene set. By applying set cover to the ConsensusPathDB dataset we were able to produce a reduced set of pathways, representing 100% of the genes in the original data set with 74% less redundancy, or 95% of the genes with 88% less redundancy. We also developed an algorithm to simplify enrichment data and applied it to a set of enriched osteoarthritis pathways, revealing that within the top ten pathways, five were redundant subsets of more enriched pathways. Applying set cover to the enrichment results removed these redundant pathways allowing more informative pathways to take their place. Conclusion: Our method provides an alternative approach for handling pathway redundancy, while ensuring that the pathways are of homogeneous size and gene coverage is maximised. Pathways are not altered from their original form, allowing biological knowledge regarding the data set to be directly applicable. We demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to prioritise redundancy reduction, pathway size control or gene set coverage. The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.</description><published>1526022000000</published><fingerprint>4702538</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: The consolidation of pathway databases, such as KEGG[1], Reactome[2]and ConsensusPathDB[3], has generated widespread biological interest, however the issue of pathway redundancy impedes the use of these consolidated datasets.

(I last &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/03/16/the_mysterious_origins_of_the_quinolones&quot;&gt;wrote about them here&lt;/a&gt;, with the various arguments about how they were developed in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for many years now, it’s been increasingly clear that this class of drugs can have some very unwelcome effects in some patients. The most prominent of these is tendon damage, which often showing up as problems with the Achilles tendon, up to outright rupture even months after drug treatment. Other muscle and connective tissue effects have been seen, as well as CNS effects and others. Over the years, the drugs have picked up black-box warnings for these effects, which seems entirely appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do these things happen, though? Any theory has to take into account the fact that the great majority of patients seem tolerate the drugs pretty well, but that suggests that a better knowledge of the mechanism might let you pick out which people shouldn’t take them in the first place. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03267-5&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; is a good summary of current research in the area. An intriguing possibility is that the effects are (at least partially) due to mitochondrial damage, likely oxidative stress, and that this might be correlated with patients who do not metabolize the fluoroquinolone scaffold as well as the general population. This might allow levels of the drugs to build up intracellularly, and since mitochondria are always dealing with the effects of their metabolic role, they’re vulnerable to being overloaded. It’s worth remembering that mitochondria have bacteria-like ancestry, so they’re certainly not guaranteed against large antibiotic concentrations. Indeed, bactericidal antibiotics in general &lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/192/192ra85.short&quot;&gt;have been associated&lt;/a&gt; with oxidative damage, an effect that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20625181&quot;&gt;has not gone unnoticed&lt;/a&gt; in drug development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a disturbing part of the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; article, though, where some researchers in the field talk about their worries about publishing results that could affect the commercial prospects of widely used drugs. I understand companies wanting to protect themselves against unfounded accusations, and there’s an endless supply of those. This blog allows me a personal look at many of them, and they just keep on coming. But not all reports of trouble with marketed drugs are unfounded – far from it. It’s a black eye for the industry to go after honest researchers reporting their honest results. Every big organization is vulnerable to falling into this sort of overdefensive behavior under pressure, but that means that the effect is well-known enough that it should be guarded against more effectively. We should be better; we should do better.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Fluoroquinolone Trouble Untangled</title><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><fingerprint>82f79307</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/23/fluoroquinolone-trouble-untangled</href></item></alternate><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13559</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e36:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198039</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoshiaki Shimada, Hideki Shimura, Ryota Tanaka, Kazuo Yamashiro, Masato Koike, Yasuo Uchiyama, Takao Urabe, Nobutaka Hattori&lt;/p&gt;
Loss of integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in ischemic stroke victims initiates a devastating cascade of events causing brain damage. Maintaining the BBB is important to preserve brain function in ischemic stroke. Unfortunately, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only effective fibrinolytic treatment at the acute stage of ischemic stroke, also injures the BBB and increases the risk of brain edema and secondary hemorrhagic transformation. Thus, it is important to identify compounds that maintain BBB integrity in the face of ischemic injury in patients with stroke. We previously demonstrated that intravenously injected phosphorylated recombinant heat shock protein 27 (prHSP27) protects the brains of mice with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), an animal stroke-model. Here, we determined whether prHSP27, in addition to attenuating brain injury, also decreases BBB damage in hyperglycemic tMCAO mice that had received tPA. After induction of hyperglycemia and tMCAO, we examined 4 treatment groups: 1) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2) prHSP27, 3) tPA, 4) tPA plus prHSP27. We examined the effects of prHSP27 by comparing the BSA and prHSP27 groups and the tPA and tPA plus prHSP27 groups. Twenty-four hours after injection, prHSP27 reduced infarct volume, brain swelling, neurological deficits, the loss of microvessel proteins and endothelial cell walls, and mortality. It also reduced the rates of hemorrhagic transformation, extravasation of endogenous IgG, and MMP-9 activity, signs of BBB damage. Therefore, prHSP27 injection attenuated brain damage and preserved the BBB in tPA-injected, hyperglycemic tMCAO experimental stroke-model mice, in which the BBB is even more severely damaged than in simple tMCAO mice. The attenuation of brain damage and BBB disruption in the presence of tPA suggests the effectiveness of prHSP27 and tPA as a combination therapy. prHSP27 may be a novel therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke patients whose BBBs are injured following tPA injections.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198039</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Phosphorylated recombinant HSP27 protects the brain and attenuates blood-brain barrier disruption following stroke in mice receiving intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yoshiaki Shimada, Hideki Shimura, Ryota Tanaka, Kazuo Yamashiro, Masato Koike, Yasuo Uchiyama, Takao Urabe, Nobutaka Hattori&lt;/p&gt;

A common goal in data-analysis is to sift through a large data-matrix and detect any significant submatrices (i.e., biclusters) that have a low numerical rank. We present a simple algorithm for tackling this biclustering problem. Our algorithm accumulates information about 2-by-2 submatrices (i.e., ‘loops’) within the data-matrix, and focuses on rows and columns of the data-matrix that participate in an abundance of low-rank loops. We demonstrate, through analysis and numerical-experiments, that this loop-counting method performs well in a variety of scenarios, outperforming simple spectral methods in many situations of interest. Another important feature of our method is that it can easily be modified to account for aspects of experimental design which commonly arise in practice. For example, our algorithm can be modified to correct for controls, categorical- and continuous-covariates, as well as sparsity within the data. We demonstrate these practical features with two examples; the first drawn from gene-expression analysis and the second drawn from a much larger genome-wide-association-study (GWAS).&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbY469xyEU0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526331600000</published><fingerprint>fafdb084</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006105</link><title>A loop-counting method for covariate-corrected low-rank biclustering of gene-expression and genome-wide association study data</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aaditya V.

We surgically constructed two AMIs within the residual limb of a subject with a transtibial amputation. Each AMI sends control signals to one joint of a two-degree-of-freedom ankle-foot prosthesis and provides proprioceptive information pertaining to the movement of that joint. The AMI subject displayed improved control over the prosthesis compared to a group of four subjects having traditional amputation. We also show natural reflexive behaviors during stair ambulation in the AMI subject that do not appear in the cohort of subjects with traditional amputation.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To distinguish clinical factors that have time-varying (as opposed to constant) impact upon patient and graft survival among pediatric liver transplant recipients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using national data from 2002 through 2013, we examined potential clinical and demographic covariates using Gray’s piecewise constant time-varying coefficients (TVC) models. For both patient and graft survival, we estimated univariable and multivariable Gray’s TVC, retaining significant covariates based on backward selection. We then estimated the same specification using traditional Cox proportional hazards (PH) models and compared our findings.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For patient survival, covariates included recipient diagnosis, age, race/ethnicity, ventilator support, encephalopathy, creatinine levels, use of living donor, and donor age. Only the effects of recipient diagnosis and donor age were constant; effects of other covariates varied over time. We retained identical covariates in the graft survival model but found several differences in their impact.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The flexibility afforded by Gray’s TVC estimation methods identify several covariates that do not satisfy constant proportionality assumptions of the Cox PH model.

Diminishing the cost of broiler chicken diet is a critical issue in the poultry industry. Numerous studies were performed to achieve this pivotal objective by diet supplementation with alternative feed additives. In the current study, low-energy broiler rations were supplemented with different commercial multienzyme formulations to minimize the cost, and increase the digestibility and absorption of the digested macronutrients. Cobb Avian 48 broiler chicks (mixed sex, 1-d-old, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3120) were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group was subdivided into four replicates (130 birds per replicate). The birds were randomly allocated into a control group fed basal diet (CB); control group fed low-energy diet (CL); and birds fed low-energy diets supplemented with different enzyme formulations. The enzyme formulations used were Xylam 500&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLX group), Hemicell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLH group), Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLA group), and Megazyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLM group,) following the doses recommended by the manufacturers. The growth performance of CLA and CLH group birds was significantly improved when compared with CL. In comparison with CB, Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) increased the intestinal &lt;i&gt;PEPT1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GLUT2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ACC&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;IL-2&lt;/i&gt; expression; PEPT1 facilitates the absorption of micronutrients. In conclusion, exogenous multienzyme complexes may be included in the low-energy diet to enhance the performance of broiler chickens (Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; ˃ Hemicell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; ˃ Megazyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;), and reduce the diet cost by up-regulating the expression of intestinal nutrient transporter genes, and improving the immunity and serum biochemical parameters of broiler chickens.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198085</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Exogenous dietary enzyme formulations improve growth performance of broiler chickens fed a low-energy diet targeting the intestinal nutrient transporter genes</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ahmed A.

WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase that is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and has been implicated as a driver in a variety of hematological and solid tumors. Currently, there is a complete lack of validated chemical matter for this important drug discovery target. Herein we report on the first fully validated WHSC1 inhibitor, PTD2, a norleucine-containing peptide derived from the histone H4 sequence. This peptide exhibits micromolar affinity towards WHSC1 in biochemical and biophysical assays. Furthermore, a crystal structure was solved with the peptide in complex with SAM and the SET domain of WHSC1L1. This inhibitor is an important first step in creating potent, selective WHSC1 tool compounds for the purposes of understanding the complex biology in relation to human disease.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197082</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Identification of a peptide inhibitor for the histone methyltransferase WHSC1</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids (OCSFA) have been associated with potential health benefits. Although some OCSFA (e.g., C15:0 and C17:0) are found in meats and dairy products, sources and metabolism of C19:0 and C23:0 are relatively unknown, and the influence of non-dietary determinants, including genetic factors, on circulating levels of OCSFA is not established.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biological processes that influence circulating levels of OCSFA by investigating associations between genetic variation and OCSFA.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma phospholipid/erythrocyte levels of C15:0, C17:0, C19:0, and C23:0 among 11,494 individuals of European descent. We also investigated relationships between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lactase (&lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt;) gene, associated with adult-onset lactase intolerance, with circulating levels of dairy-derived OCSFA, and evaluated associations of candidate sphingolipid genes with C23:0 levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found no genome-wide significant evidence that common genetic variation is associated with circulating levels of C15:0 or C23:0. In two cohorts with available data, we identified one intronic SNP (rs13361131) in myosin X gene (&lt;i&gt;MYO10)&lt;/i&gt; associated with C17:0 level (P = 1.37×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;), and two intronic SNP (rs12874278 and rs17363566) in deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (&lt;i&gt;DLEU1)&lt;/i&gt; region associated with C19:0 level (P = 7.07×10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, when using a candidate-gene approach, we found evidence that three SNPs in &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; (rs11884924, rs16832067, and rs3816088) are associated with circulating C17:0 level (adjusted P = 4×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, nine SNPs in the ceramide synthase 4 (&lt;i&gt;CERS4)&lt;/i&gt; region were associated with circulating C23:0 levels (adjusted P&amp;lt;5×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that circulating levels of OCSFA may be predominantly influenced by non-genetic factors. SNPs associated with C17:0 level in the &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; gene may reflect genetic influence in dairy consumption or in metabolism of dairy foods.

In long-term potentiation (LTP), one of the most studied types of neural plasticity, synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to stimulation. Although a number of different proteins have been implicated in the sub-cellular molecular processes underlying induction and maintenance of LTP, the precise mechanisms remain unknown. A particular challenge is to demonstrate that a proposed molecular mechanism can provide the level of stability needed to maintain memories for months or longer, in spite of the fact that many of the participating molecules have much shorter life spans. Here we present a computational model that combines simulations of several biochemical reactions that have been suggested in the LTP literature and show that the resulting system does exhibit the required stability. At the core of the model are two interlinked feedback loops of molecular reactions, one involving the atypical protein kinase PKMζ and its messenger RNA, the other involving PKMζ and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors. We demonstrate that robust bistability–stable equilibria both in the synapse’s potentiated and unpotentiated states–can arise from a set of simple molecular reactions. The model is able to account for a wide range of empirical results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory reconsolidation and the effects of different pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0_PVuKNJRBs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><fingerprint>2c540046</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006147</link><title>Coupled feedback loops maintain synaptic long-term potentiation: A computational model of PKMzeta synthesis and AMPA receptor trafficking</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Helfer, Thomas R.

The family Streblidae comprises a monophyletic group of Hippoboscoidea, hematophagous dipterans that parasitize bats. &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. and &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; spp. have been reported in bats sampled in Europe, Africa, Asia, North, Central and South America. However, there are few reports on the &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; bacteria infecting Hippoboscoidea flies and mites. While Spinturnicidae mites are ectoparasites found only in bats, those belonging to the family Macronyssidae comprise mites that also parasitize other mammal species. This study investigates the occurrence and assesses the phylogenetic positioning of &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. and &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; spp. found in Streblidae flies and Spinturnicidae and Macronyssidae mites collected from bats captured in Brazil. From May 2011 to April 2012 and September 2013 to December 2014, 400 Streblidae flies, 100 Macronyssidaes, and 100 Spinturnicidae mites were collected from bats captured in two sites in northeastern Nova Iguaçu, Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. Forty (19.8%) out of 202 Streblidae flies were positive for &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. in qPCR assays based on the &lt;i&gt;nuoG&lt;/i&gt; gene.

The family Streblidae comprises a monophyletic group of Hippoboscoidea, hematophagous dipterans that parasitize bats. &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. and &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; spp. have been reported in bats sampled in Europe, Africa, Asia, North, Central and South America. However, there are few reports on the &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; bacteria infecting Hippoboscoidea flies and mites. While Spinturnicidae mites are ectoparasites found only in bats, those belonging to the family Macronyssidae comprise mites that also parasitize other mammal species. This study investigates the occurrence and assesses the phylogenetic positioning of &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. and &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; spp. found in Streblidae flies and Spinturnicidae and Macronyssidae mites collected from bats captured in Brazil. From May 2011 to April 2012 and September 2013 to December 2014, 400 Streblidae flies, 100 Macronyssidaes, and 100 Spinturnicidae mites were collected from bats captured in two sites in northeastern Nova Iguaçu, Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. Forty (19.8%) out of 202 Streblidae flies were positive for &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. in qPCR assays based on the &lt;i&gt;nuoG&lt;/i&gt; gene. Among the flies positive for the bacterium, six (18%) were &lt;i&gt;Paratrichobius longicrus&lt;/i&gt;, seven (29%) &lt;i&gt;Strebla guajiro&lt;/i&gt;, two (40%) &lt;i&gt;Aspidoptera phyllostomatis&lt;/i&gt;, five (11%) &lt;i&gt;Aspidoptera falcata&lt;/i&gt;, one (10%) &lt;i&gt;Trichobius anducei&lt;/i&gt;, one (25%) &lt;i&gt;Megistopoda aranea&lt;/i&gt;, and 18 (32%) &lt;i&gt;Trichobius joblingi&lt;/i&gt;, and collected from bats of the following species: &lt;i&gt;Artibeus lituratus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Carollia perspicillata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Artibeus planirostris&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sturnira lilium&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Artibeus obscurus&lt;/i&gt;.

MiRNA molecules are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the brain function. Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of Aβ in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ, and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196929</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Defensive effect of microRNA-200b/c against amyloid-beta peptide-induced toxicity in Alzheimer&apos;s disease models</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Higaki, Masashi Muramatsu, Akio Matsuda, Kenji Matsumoto, Jun-ichi Satoh, Makoto Michikawa, Shumpei Niida&lt;/p&gt;

Inflammation causes nociceptive sensory neuron activation, evoking debilitating symptoms and reflexes. Inflammatory signaling pathways are capable of modulating mitochondrial function, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization and calcium release. Previously we showed that mitochondrial modulation with antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor, selectively stimulated nociceptive bronchopulmonary C-fibers via the activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 (A1) and vanilloid 1 (V1) cation channels. TRPA1 is ROS-sensitive, but there is little evidence that TRPV1 is activated by ROS. Here, we used dual imaging of dissociated vagal neurons to investigate the correlation of mitochondrial superoxide production (mitoSOX) or mitochondrial depolarization (JC-1) with cytosolic calcium (Fura-2AM), following mitochondrial modulation by antimycin A, rotenone (complex I inhibitor) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, mitochondrial uncoupling agent). Mitochondrial modulation by all agents selectively increased cytosolic calcium in a subset of TRPA1/TRPV1-expressing (A1/V1+) neurons. There was a significant correlation between antimycin A-induced calcium responses and mitochondrial superoxide in wild-type ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons, which was eliminated in TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons.

Inflammation causes nociceptive sensory neuron activation, evoking debilitating symptoms and reflexes. Inflammatory signaling pathways are capable of modulating mitochondrial function, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization and calcium release. Previously we showed that mitochondrial modulation with antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor, selectively stimulated nociceptive bronchopulmonary C-fibers via the activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 (A1) and vanilloid 1 (V1) cation channels. TRPA1 is ROS-sensitive, but there is little evidence that TRPV1 is activated by ROS. Here, we used dual imaging of dissociated vagal neurons to investigate the correlation of mitochondrial superoxide production (mitoSOX) or mitochondrial depolarization (JC-1) with cytosolic calcium (Fura-2AM), following mitochondrial modulation by antimycin A, rotenone (complex I inhibitor) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, mitochondrial uncoupling agent). Mitochondrial modulation by all agents selectively increased cytosolic calcium in a subset of TRPA1/TRPV1-expressing (A1/V1+) neurons. There was a significant correlation between antimycin A-induced calcium responses and mitochondrial superoxide in wild-type ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons, which was eliminated in TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Nevertheless, antimycin A-induced superoxide production did not always increase calcium in A1/V1+ neurons, suggesting a critical role of an unknown factor. CCCP caused both superoxide production and mitochondrial depolarization but neither correlated with calcium fluxes in A1/V1+ neurons. Rotenone-induced calcium responses in ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons correlated with mitochondrial depolarization but not superoxide production. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction causes calcium fluxes in a subset of A1/V1+ neurons via ROS-dependent and ROS-independent mechanisms.</content></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Katherine R.

&lt;i&gt;Trichinella spiralis&lt;/i&gt; mainly dwells in the muscle tissue of its host and is the main causative agent of trichinellosis in humans.

Of the 1,476 proteins detected in the ML, 121 proteins showed differential expression, including 50 significantly upregulated and 71 downregulated proteins. The functions of the 108 annotated proteins were primarily related to signal transduction, transcription/translation, material metabolism, protein synthesis/assembly/degradation, and stress/defense/antioxidation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay verified that FRMD5 and CUT-1 gene expression levels were significantly increased, while COX2 gene expression level was significantly decreased. GO annotation and KEGG pathway analyses showed that the majority of differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the molecular function of the catalytic activity, biological process of the immune system process, metabolic process, cellular component organization, biological adhesion, and cellular component of the macromolecular complex. Our results demonstrate the first comprehensive protein expression profile of the &lt;i&gt;ML&lt;/i&gt; in response to NO stress and provide novel references for understanding the potential mechanism underlying the effects of NO on trichinellosis.</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Proteomic analysis of the response of &amp;lt;i&gt;Trichinella spiralis&amp;lt;/i&gt; muscle larvae to exogenous nitric oxide</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoli Wang, Liang Li, Xing Wei, Yuanyuan Wang, Hui Zhang, Ao Shi, Tao Liu, Xiaodi Yang, Qiang Fang&lt;/p&gt;

The cost of specialized scientific equipment can be high and with limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso- and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term ‘superlamellae consolidation’ to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of &gt;99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197999</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Open-source micro-tensile testers via additive manufacturing for the mechanical characterization of thin films and papers</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Krishanu Nandy, David W.

Women’s groups practicing participatory learning and action (PLA) in rural areas have been shown to improve maternal and newborn survival in low-income countries, but the pathways from intervention to impact remain unclear. We assessed the long-term impact of a PLA intervention in rural Nepal on women’s agency in the household. In 2014, we conducted a follow-up study to a cluster randomised controlled trial on the impact of PLA women’s groups from 2001–2003. Agency was measured using the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) and its subdomains. Multi-level regression analyses were performed adjusting for baseline socio-demographic characteristics. We additionally adjusted for potential exposure to subsequent PLA groups based on women’s pregnancy status and conduct of PLA groups in areas of residence. Sensitivity analyses were performed using two alternative measures of agency. We analysed outcomes for 4030 mothers (66% of the cohort) who survived and were recruited to follow-up at mean age 39.6 years. Across a wide range of model specifications, we found no association between exposure to the original PLA intervention with women’s agency in the household approximately 11.5 years later. Subsequent exposure to PLA groups was not associated with greater agency in the household at follow-up, but some specifications found evidence for reduced agency.

Women’s groups practicing participatory learning and action (PLA) in rural areas have been shown to improve maternal and newborn survival in low-income countries, but the pathways from intervention to impact remain unclear. We assessed the long-term impact of a PLA intervention in rural Nepal on women’s agency in the household. In 2014, we conducted a follow-up study to a cluster randomised controlled trial on the impact of PLA women’s groups from 2001–2003. Agency was measured using the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) and its subdomains. Multi-level regression analyses were performed adjusting for baseline socio-demographic characteristics. We additionally adjusted for potential exposure to subsequent PLA groups based on women’s pregnancy status and conduct of PLA groups in areas of residence. Sensitivity analyses were performed using two alternative measures of agency. We analysed outcomes for 4030 mothers (66% of the cohort) who survived and were recruited to follow-up at mean age 39.6 years. Across a wide range of model specifications, we found no association between exposure to the original PLA intervention with women’s agency in the household approximately 11.5 years later. Subsequent exposure to PLA groups was not associated with greater agency in the household at follow-up, but some specifications found evidence for reduced agency. Household agency may be a prerequisite for actualising the benefits of PLA groups rather than a consequence.</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Lu Gram</name></author><fingerprint>b4b9704f</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197426</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197426</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>162</engagement><crawled>1525943388898</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16349504ae2:11dfaa4:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03917-2</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genome-wide and high-density CRISPR-Cas9 screens identify point mutations in &lt;i&gt;PARP1&lt;/i&gt; causing PARP inhibitor resistance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide and high-density CRISPR-Cas9 screens identify point mutations in &amp;lt;i&gt;PARP1&amp;lt;/i&gt; causing PARP inhibitor resistance, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03917-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03917-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The mechanisms of PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance are poorly understood.

Background &lt;p&gt;Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive and life-limiting condition. From a healthcare perspective it is vital to establish effective methods of improving the quality of remaining life in these patients. This requires a detailed understanding of the multiple impacts of an IPF diagnosis on the individual.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We sought to understand how patients coped with their initial diagnosis, how they live with the disease day-to-day, and their experiences and opinions of the professional support they receive. A patient-centred approach was used to explore the social, psychological and physical impacts of IPF. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by an experienced academic. Interview questions were written by the researchers but guided by informal conversations with patients and clinicians. An inductive thematic approach was used to analyse the data, allowing us to identify common themes in the patients’ experiences.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of fifty invited participants, ten took part in the study (aged 53–81 years; 9 male). Inductive analysis of interviews identified seven second-order themes and eleven first-order themes, represented by two General Dimensions: ‘&lt;i&gt;Patient experience with the condition’&lt;/i&gt; and ‘&lt;i&gt;Patient-led recommendations for practice’&lt;/i&gt;. The key message on ‘coping’ in these patients was that acceptance of their condition led to a sense of optimism. Participants reported using appraisal-focused coping strategies to change their perspectives (thinking positively) and emotion-focused strategies to overcome depression (the main opportunity for emotional expression being an IPF support group). The support group also facilitated problem-focused coping: individuals exchanged knowledge and experience and gave one another tips on how to live with their condition.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Health professionals should provide patients with information that focuses on &lt;i&gt;living&lt;/i&gt; with IPF, encouraging them to make lifestyle changes and adaptations to improve quality of life. Family members should receive education about IPF so that they can support such changes. Patients should be encouraged to join a support group and to participate in physical activity (again preferably group-based). This study offers novel findings that will help inform much-needed changes in the practice of supporting IPF patients to cope with their diagnosis and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197660</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Patients’ experiences of coping with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and their recommendations for its clinical management</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sameera Senanayake, Kim Harrison, Michael Lewis, Melitta McNarry, Joanne Hudson&lt;/p&gt;

Signaling networks reprogrammed by protein overexpression remain largely uncharacterized, hindering discovery of paths to therapeutic intervention. We previously developed a single cell proteomics approach based on mass cytometry that enables quantitative assessment of overexpression effects on the signaling network. Here we applied this approach in a human kinome- and phosphatome-wide study to assess how 649 individually overexpressed proteins modulate the cancer-related signaling network in HEK293T cells. Based on these data we expanded the functional classification of human kinases and phosphatases and detected 208 novel signaling relationships. In the signaling dynamics analysis, we showed that increased ERK-specific phosphatases sustained proliferative signaling, and using a novel combinatorial overexpression approach, we confirmed this phosphatase-driven mechanism of cancer progression. Finally, we identified 54 proteins that caused ligand-independent ERK activation with potential as biomarkers for drug resistance in cells carrying BRAF mutations.</description><published>1525762800000</published><fingerprint>88ed25ec</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/314716v2?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Kinase and phosphatase overexpression drives tumorigenesis and drug resistance in many cancer types.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cigarette smoking by pregnant women is associated with a significant increase in the risk for cognitive disorders in their children. Preclinical models confirm this risk by showing that exposure of the developing brain to nicotine produces adverse behavioral outcomes. Here we describe behavioral phenotypes resulting from perinatal nicotine exposure in a mouse model, and discuss our findings in the context of findings from previously published studies using preclinical models of developmental nicotine exposure.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Female C57Bl/6 mice received drinking water containing nicotine (100μg/ml) + saccharin (2%) starting 3 weeks prior to breeding and continuing throughout pregnancy, and until 3 weeks postpartum. Over the same period, female mice in two control groups received drinking water containing saccharin (2%) or plain drinking water. Offspring from each group were weaned at 3-weeks of age and subjected to behavioral analyses at 3 months of age. We examined spontaneous locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, spatial working memory, object based attention, recognition memory and impulsive-like behavior. We found significant deficits in attention and working memory only in male mice, and no significant changes in the other behavioral phenotypes in male or female mice. Exposure to saccharin alone did not produce significant changes in either sex.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion/Significance &lt;p&gt;The perinatal nicotine exposure produced significant deficits in attention and working memory in a sex-dependent manner in that the male but not female offspring displayed these behaviors. These behavioral phenotypes are associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and have been reported in other studies that used pre- or perinatal nicotine exposure. Therefore, we suggest that preclinical models of developmental nicotine exposure could be useful tools for modeling ADHD and related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198064</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Attention and working memory deficits in a perinatal nicotine exposure mouse model</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lin Zhang, Thomas J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an important biomarker for patients with cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. It is also known that BNP levels are relatively higher in patients with chronic kidney disease and no heart disease; however, the mechanism remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We developed a BNP reporter mouse and occasionally found that this promoter was activated specifically in the papillary tip of the kidneys, and its activation was not accompanied by &lt;i&gt;BNP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression. No evidence was found to support the existence of BNP isoforms or other nucleotide expression apart from BNP and tdTomato. The pBNP-tdTomato-positive cells were interstitial cells and were not proliferative. Unexpectedly, both the expression and secretion of BNP increased in primary cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes after their treatment with an extract of the renal papillary tip. Intraperitoneal injection of the extract of the papillary tips reduced blood pressure from 210 mmHg to 165 mmHg, the decrease being accompanied by an increase in serum BNP and urinary cGMP production in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHR-SP) rats. Furthermore the induction of BNP by the papillary extract from rats with heart failure due to myocardial infarction was increased in cardiomyocytes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results suggested that the papillary tip express a substance that can stimulate BNP production and secretion from cardiomyocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197078</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Renal papillary tip extract stimulates BNP production and excretion from cardiomyocytes</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Itaru Goto, Ryuji Okamoto, Ryotaro Hashizume, Noboru Suzuki, Rie Ito, Keiichi Yamanaka, Hiromitsu Saito, Hiroshi Kiyonari, Isao Tawara, Yuki Kageyama, Yoshito Ogihara, Yusuf Ali, Norikazu Yamada, Naoyuki Katayama, Masaaki Ito&lt;/p&gt;

Neonatal mortality is a significant problem in many low-resource countries, yet for every death there are many more newborns who suffer a life-threatening complication but survive. These “near-misses” are not well defined, nor are they well understood. This study sought to explore how health care providers at three tertiary care centers in Ghana (each with neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)) understand the term “near-miss.” Eighteen providers from the NICUs at three teaching hospitals in Ghana (Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, and Cape Coast Teaching Hospital in Cape Coast) were interviewed in depth regarding their perceptions of neonatal morbidity, mortality, and survival. Near the end of the interview, they were specifically asked what they understood the term “near-miss” to mean. Participants included nurses and physicians at various levels and with varying years of practice (mean years of practice = 9.33, mean years in NICU = 3.66). Results indicate that the concept of “near-misses” is not universally understood, and providers differ on whether a baby is a near-miss or not. Providers disagreed on the utility of a near-miss classification for clinical practice, with some suggesting it would be helpful to draw their attention to those at highest risk of dying, with others suggesting that the acuity of illness in a NICU means any baby could become a ‘near-miss’ at any moment. Further efforts are needed to standardize the definitions of neonatal near-misses, including developing criteria that are able to be assessed in a low-resource setting. In addition, further research is warranted to determine the practical implications of using a near miss tool in the process of providing care in a resource-limited setting and whether it might be best reserved as a retrospective indicator of overall quality of care provided.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198169</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>&quot;We call them miracle babies&quot;: How health care providers understand neonatal near-misses at three teaching hospitals in Ghana</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by April J.

Neonatal mortality is a significant problem in many low-resource countries, yet for every death there are many more newborns who suffer a life-threatening complication but survive. These “near-misses” are not well defined, nor are they well understood. This study sought to explore how health care providers at three tertiary care centers in Ghana (each with neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)) understand the term “near-miss.” Eighteen providers from the NICUs at three teaching hospitals in Ghana (Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, and Cape Coast Teaching Hospital in Cape Coast) were interviewed in depth regarding their perceptions of neonatal morbidity, mortality, and survival. Near the end of the interview, they were specifically asked what they understood the term “near-miss” to mean. Participants included nurses and physicians at various levels and with varying years of practice (mean years of practice = 9.33, mean years in NICU = 3.66). Results indicate that the concept of “near-misses” is not universally understood, and providers differ on whether a baby is a near-miss or not. Providers disagreed on the utility of a near-miss classification for clinical practice, with some suggesting it would be helpful to draw their attention to those at highest risk of dying, with others suggesting that the acuity of illness in a NICU means any baby could become a ‘near-miss’ at any moment. Further efforts are needed to standardize the definitions of neonatal near-misses, including developing criteria that are able to be assessed in a low-resource setting. In addition, further research is warranted to determine the practical implications of using a near miss tool in the process of providing care in a resource-limited setting and whether it might be best reserved as a retrospective indicator of overall quality of care provided.</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>April J.

Glucose and palmitate synergistically stimulate insulin secretion, but chronically elevated they induce apoptotic β-cell death. The glucotoxic effect has been attributed, at least partly, to the upregulation of the oxidative stress marker thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). Palmitate downregulates TXNIP expression, the functional significance of which is still under debate. This study examines the mechanism and consequence of palmitate-mediated TXNIP regulation in insulin secreting cells. Palmitate (600 μM) reduced TXNIP mRNA levels in isolated human and mouse islets independently of FFAR1/GPR40. Similar effects of palmitate were observed in INS-1E cells and mimicked by other long chain fatty acids. The lowering of TXNIP mRNA was significant already 1 h after addition of palmitate, persisted for 24 h and was directly translated to changes in TXNIP protein. The pharmacological inhibition of palmitate-induced phosphorylation of AMPK, ERK1/2, JNK and PKCα/β by BML-275, PD98059, SP600125 and Gö6976, respectively, did not abolish palmitate-mediated TXNIP downregulation. The effect of palmitate was superimposed by a time-dependent (8 h and 24 h) decline of TXNIP mRNA and protein. This decline correlated with accumulation of secreted insulin into the medium. Accordingly, exogenously added insulin reduced TXNIP mRNA and protein levels, an effect counteracted by the insulin/IGF-1 receptor antagonist linsitinib. The inhibition of PI3K and Akt/PKB increased TXNIP mRNA levels. The histone deacetylase (HDAC1/2/3) inhibitor MS-275 completely abrogated the time-dependent, insulin-mediated reduction of TXNIP, leaving the effect of palmitate unaltered. Acute stimulation of insulin secretion and chronic accentuation of cell death by palmitate occurred independently of TXNIP regulation. On the contrary, palmitate antagonized glucose-augmented ROS production. In conclusion, glucose-induced TXNIP expression is efficiently antagonized by two independent mechanisms, namely via an autocrine activation of insulin/IGF-1 receptors involving HDAC and by palmitate attenuating oxidative stress of β-cells.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198016</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Palmitate and insulin counteract glucose-induced thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) expression in insulin secreting cells via distinct mechanisms</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Madhura Panse, Oliver Kluth, Estela Lorza-Gil, Gabriele Kaiser, Eckhard Mühlbauer, Annette Schürmann, Hans-Ulrich Häring, Susanne Ullrich, Felicia Gerst&lt;/p&gt;

The pharmacological inhibition of palmitate-induced phosphorylation of AMPK, ERK1/2, JNK and PKCα/β by BML-275, PD98059, SP600125 and Gö6976, respectively, did not abolish palmitate-mediated TXNIP downregulation. The effect of palmitate was superimposed by a time-dependent (8 h and 24 h) decline of TXNIP mRNA and protein. This decline correlated with accumulation of secreted insulin into the medium. Accordingly, exogenously added insulin reduced TXNIP mRNA and protein levels, an effect counteracted by the insulin/IGF-1 receptor antagonist linsitinib. The inhibition of PI3K and Akt/PKB increased TXNIP mRNA levels. The histone deacetylase (HDAC1/2/3) inhibitor MS-275 completely abrogated the time-dependent, insulin-mediated reduction of TXNIP, leaving the effect of palmitate unaltered. Acute stimulation of insulin secretion and chronic accentuation of cell death by palmitate occurred independently of TXNIP regulation. On the contrary, palmitate antagonized glucose-augmented ROS production. In conclusion, glucose-induced TXNIP expression is efficiently antagonized by two independent mechanisms, namely via an autocrine activation of insulin/IGF-1 receptors involving HDAC and by palmitate attenuating oxidative stress of β-cells.</content></content><updated>1527627600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Madhura Panse</name></author><fingerprint>98b8bbb1</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198016</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198016</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>12</engagement><crawled>1525770957557</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f0932f5:133cbf:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24236-y</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next Generation Sequencing of urine exfoliated cells: an approach of prostate cancer microRNAs research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next Generation Sequencing of urine exfoliated cells: an approach of prostate cancer microRNAs research, Published online: 08 May 2018;

Melatonin is a molecule that can enhance the resistance of plants to abiotic stress. It can alleviate the damage of heavy metal ions, and other chemical substances, changes in temperature and humidity, oxidative stress in higher plants, and enhance resistance of plants to abiotic stress. The transformation of N-Acetyl-5-hydroxy tryptamin into melatonin requires the involvement of methyltransferase. In this study, a methyltransferase gene &lt;i&gt;ZjOMT&lt;/i&gt; has been cloned from &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;. The gene was induced by aluminum (Al) stress in the leaves and roots of &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;, and was up-regulated by 20.86- and 31.18-folds, respectively. The expression of ZjOMT in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; increased the content of melatonin by about 8-fold in the recombinant strain compared with that of the empty vector strain. Al resistance test showed that the resistance of recombinant strain BL21-pET32-ZjOMT to Al was significantly higher than that of the empty vector strain BL21-pET32. The survival rate of the recombinant strain expressing ZjOMT was about 100-fold higher than that of the empty vector strain when treated with 0.35 mM Al. These findings suggest that the heterologous expression of ZjOMT improved the resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; to Al by increasing the content of melatonin.</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196952</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Heterologous expression of ZjOMT from &amp;lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&amp;lt;/i&gt; in &amp;lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; confers aluminum resistance through melatonin production</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hongsong Luo, Chunyan He, Liebao Han&lt;/p&gt;

In the first experiment, we test the model&apos;s ability to differentiate a true protein-protein network from a randomly generated network. In the second experiment, we test the model in identifying orthologs from randomly-matched genes in human, mouse, and fly. In both experiments, a hybrid of NLP and GO-tree based method achieves the best classification accuracy.</description><published>1526281200000</published><fingerprint>490fc7da</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/103648v5?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Gene Ontology (GO) database contains GO terms that describe biological functions of genes.

Recent studies indicate that lifestyle factors in early life affect breast cancer risk. We therefore explored the association of high consumption of meat, milk, and whole grain products in adolescence and midlife, on breast cancer risk. We used data from the population based AGES-Reykjavik cohort (2002–2006), where 3,326 women with a mean age of 77 years (SD 6.0) participated. For food items and principal component derived dietary patterns we used Cox proportional models to calculate multivariate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). During a mean follow-up of 8.8 years, 97 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. For both adolescence and midlife, daily consumption of rye bread was positively associated with breast cancer (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.6 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1–2.9, respectively). In contrast, persistent high consumption of oatmeal was negatively associated with breast cancer (0.4, 95% CI 0.2–0.9). No association was found for other food items or dietary patterns that included rye bread. High rye bread consumption in adolescence and midlife may increase risk of late-life breast cancer whilst persistent consumption of oatmeal may reduce the risk.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198017</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Dietary habits in adolescence and midlife and risk of breast cancer in older women</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alfheidur Haraldsdottir, Johanna E.

High rye bread consumption in adolescence and midlife may increase risk of late-life breast cancer whilst persistent consumption of oatmeal may reduce the risk.</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Alfheidur Haraldsdottir</name></author><fingerprint>8db0474d</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198017</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198017</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>5</engagement><crawled>1528198627625</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163cfbc8129:5439c24:7cfe07d6</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05328-1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smarter metrics will help fix our food system&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smarter metrics will help fix our food system, Published online: 05 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05328-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05328-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Think less about bigger crop yields, and more about better lives, says Pavan Sukhdev, as more-comprehensive evaluation techniques are unveiled.</description><published>1528182000000</published><engagementRate>0.26</engagementRate><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05328-1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smarter metrics will help fix our food system&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smarter metrics will help fix our food system, Published online: 05 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05328-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05328-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Think less about bigger crop yields, and more about better lives, says Pavan Sukhdev, as more-comprehensive evaluation techniques are unveiled.</content></content><title>Smarter metrics will help fix our food system</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05328-1/d41586-018-05328-1_15800040.jpg</url><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>Pavan Sukhdev</name></author><fingerprint>629d6188</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05328-1</href></item></alternate></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1526887776990</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163819a82de:61571ca:3dd877af</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025057?af=R</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526354405000</published><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025057?af=R</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/19&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 19&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>DAVIS: A direct algorithm for velocity-map imaging system</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>G.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1525813200000</published><fingerprint>3e9b2388</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</link><title>Network inference reveals novel connections in pathways regulating growth and defense in the yeast salt response</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew E.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of exercise training with modest or greater weight loss (≥3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) on insulin sensitivity, lipoprotein concentrations, and lipoprotein particle size in overweight and obese participants.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Adults (N = 163, body mass index: 25–37 [kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]) participated in 8 months of exercise training. Insulin sensitivity, lipid concentrations, lipid particle size and other cardiometabolic variables were measured at baseline and follow-up. Participants were categorized by whether they achieved at least modest weight loss (≥ 3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) following the intervention.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A greater improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in adults performing exercise training with at least modest weight loss (2.2 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 1.5 to 2.8) compared to those who did not (0.8 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 0.5 to 1.2). Similar results were observed for acute insulin response, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol concentration, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size (p&amp;lt;0.05), when all exercise groups were combined. No significant results across weight loss categories were observed for LDL, HDL, glucose, or insulin levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The present study suggests that aerobic exercise combined with at least modest weight loss leads to greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, triglycerides as well as other non-traditional lipid risk factors (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL/LDL particle size). Clinicians should advocate patients who are overweight/obese to exercise and obtain modest weight loss for improved cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196637</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Effects of aerobic training with and without weight loss on insulin sensitivity and lipids</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Damon L.

Adult height is determined by both genetic characteristics and environmental factors in early life. Although previous studies have suggested that adult height is associated with risk of mortality, comprehensive associations between height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the Japanese population are unclear. We aimed to evaluate the associations between adult height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among Japanese men and women in a prospective cohort study. We investigated 107,794 participants (50,755 men and 57,039 women) aged 40 to 69 years who responded to the baseline questionnaire in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Participants were classified by quartile of adult height obtained from a self-reported questionnaire in men (&amp;lt;160cm, 160-163cm, 164-167cm, ≥168cm) and women (&amp;lt;149cm, 149-151cm, 152-155cm, ≥156cm). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality from all-cause, cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other cause mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. During follow-up, 12,320 men and 7,030 women died. Taller adult height was associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.83 (0.69–0.99); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.90–0.99)) and respiratory disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.69–1.03); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.87–0.97)), but was also associated with increased risk for overall cancer mortality (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.17 (1.07–1.28); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.04 (1.01–1.07)) in men. Taller adult height was also associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;149cm vs. ≥156cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.66–1.05); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.86–0.99)) in women.

Together, we propose that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 is one of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to aging and that stimulation of glycolysis promotes metabolic health and longevity.</description><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item></keywords><title>Epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 in aging links glycolysis to healthy longevity in Drosophila</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>jiangzhu@sioc.ac.cn (Feng Liu)</name></author><fingerprint>b6f4148</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35368</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35368</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526404381783</crawled><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16364ca7c57:39f3a24:93d646dc</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4731.short?rss=1</originId><description>CELL BIOLOGY Correction for “TWEAK and RIPK1 mediate a second wave of cell death during AKI,” by Diego Martin-Sanchez, Miguel Fontecha-Barriuso, Susana Carrasco, Maria Dolores Sanchez-Niño, Anne von Mässenhausen, Andreas Linkermann, Pablo Cannata-Ortiz, Marta Ruiz-Ortega, Jesus Egido, Alberto Ortiz, and Ana Belen Sanz, which was first published March 27, 2018;...</description><published>1526400368000</published><fingerprint>2d4ab64</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4731.short?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>CELL BIOLOGY Correction for “TWEAK and RIPK1 mediate a second wave of cell death during AKI,” by Diego Martin-Sanchez, Miguel Fontecha-Barriuso, Susana Carrasco, Maria Dolores Sanchez-Niño, Anne von Mässenhausen, Andreas Linkermann, Pablo Cannata-Ortiz, Marta Ruiz-Ortega, Jesus Egido, Alberto Ortiz, and Ana Belen Sanz, which was first published March 27, 2018;...</content></content><title>Correction for Martin-Sanchez et al., TWEAK and RIPK1 mediate a second wave of cell death during AKI [Correction]</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/20.cover-source.jpg?itok=tq2Qj6AB</url><width>359</width><height>480</height></visual><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4731</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4731.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525889484284</crawled><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1634619c5fc:d47db7:93d646dc</id><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/440/eaam6651?rss=1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;The use of autologous (or syngeneic) cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) holds great promise for future clinical use in a wide range of diseases and injuries.

There is a current interest in quantifying time-varying connectivity (TVC) based on neuroimaging data such as fMRI. Many methods have been proposed, and are being applied, revealing new insight into the brain’s dynamics. However, given that the ground truth for TVC in the brain is unknown, many concerns remain regarding the accuracy of proposed estimates. Since there exist many TVC methods it is difficult to assess differences in time-varying connectivity between studies. In this paper, we present &lt;i&gt;tvc_benchmarker&lt;/i&gt;, which is a Python package containing four simulations to test TVC methods. Here, we evaluate five different methods that together represent a wide spectrum of current approaches to estimating TVC (sliding window, tapered sliding window, multiplication of temporal derivatives, spatial distance and jackknife correlation). These simulations were designed to test each method’s ability to track changes in covariance over time, which is a key property in TVC analysis. We found that all tested methods correlated positively with each other, but there were large differences in the strength of the correlations between methods. To facilitate comparisons with future TVC methods, we propose that the described simulations can act as benchmark tests for evaluation of methods. Using &lt;i&gt;tvc_benchmarker&lt;/i&gt; researchers can easily add, compare and submit their own TVC methods to evaluate its performance.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PcnqFhi9tsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><fingerprint>ef7008cb</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006196</link><title>Simulations to benchmark time-varying connectivity methods for fMRI</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by William Hedley Thompson, Craig Geoffrey Richter, Pontus Plavén-Sigray, Peter Fransson&lt;/p&gt;

The controlled formation and stabilization of E-cadherin-based adhesions is vital for epithelial integrity. This requires co-operation between the E-cadherin-based adhesions and the associated actin cytoskeleton. In cancer, this co-operation often fails, predisposing cells to migration through molecular mechanisms that have only been partially characterized. Here, we demonstrate that the actin filament cross-linker α-actinin-1 is frequently increased in human breast cancer. In mammary epithelial cells, the increased α-actinin-1 levels promote cell migration and induce disorganized acini-like structures in Matrigel. This is accompanied by a major reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the associated E-cadherin-based adhesions. Increased expression of α-actinin-1 is particularly noted in basal-like breast cancer cell lines, and in breast cancer patients it associates with poor prognosis in basal-like subtypes. Downregulation of α-actinin-1 in E-cadherin expressing basal-like breast cancer cells demonstrate that α-actinin-1-assembled actin fibers destabilize E-cadherin-based adhesions. Taken together, these results indicate that increased α-actinin-1 expression destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions, which is likely to promote the migratory potential of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our results identify α-actinin-1 as a candidate prognostic biomarker in basal-like breast cancer.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196986</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Increased α-actinin-1 destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions and associates with poor prognosis in basal-like breast cancer</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Kovac, Tomi P.

We developed a Bayesian model, called ALPHLARD, that collects reads potentially generated from HLA genes and accurately determines a pair of HLA types for each of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1 genes at 6-digit resolution.

By comparing the results of HLA genotyping from SBT and amplicon sequencing methods, ALPHLARD achieved 98.8% for WES data and 98.5% for WGS data at 4-digit resolution. We also detected three somatic point mutations and one case of loss of heterozygosity in the HLA genes from the WGS data. ALPHLARD showed good performance for HLA genotyping even from low-coverage data. It also has a potential to detect rare germline variants and somatic mutations in HLA genes. It would help to fill in the current gaps in HLA reference databases and unveil the immunological significance of somatic mutations identified in HLA genes.</description><published>1526454000000</published><fingerprint>2639a001</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323766v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Although human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping based on amplicon, whole exome sequence (WES), and RNA sequence data has been achieved in recent years, accurate genotyping from whole genome sequence (WGS) data remains a challenge due to the low depth.

To establish 24-h urinary creatinine excretion reference ranges based on anthropometry in healthy Chinese children, a cross-sectional survey was conducted using twice-sampled 24-h urine and anthropometric variables. Age- and sex-specific 24-h creatinine excretion reference ranges (crude and related to individual anthropometric variables) were derived. During October 2013 and May 2014, urine samples were collected. Anthropometric variables were measured in the first survey. Data of 710 children (377 boys and 333 girls) aged 8–13 years who completed the study were analyzed. No significant difference was observed in 24-h urine volumes between the two samples (median [interquartile range): 855.0 [600.0–1272.0) mL vs. 900.0 [660.0–1220.0) mL, P = 0.277). The mean 24-h urine creatinine excretion was regarded as representative of absolute daily creatinine excretion in children. Sex-specific, body-weight-adjusted creatinine excretion reference values were 15.3 mg/kg/day (0.1353 mmol/kg/day) for boys and 14.3 mg/kg/day (0.1264 mmol/kg/day) for girls. Differences were significant between boys and girls within the same age group but not across different age groups within the same sex. Ideal 24-h creatinine excretion values for height were derived for potential determination of the creatinine height index. These data can serve as reference ranges to calculate ratios of analyte to creatinine. The creatinine height index can be used to assess somatic protein status.</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197672</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Anthropometry-based 24-h urinary creatinine excretion reference for Chinese children</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wang, Cong Du, Laixiang Lin, Wen Chen, Long Tan, Jun Shen, Elizabeth N.

The creatinine height index can be used to assess somatic protein status.</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Wei Wang</name></author><fingerprint>1d934016</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197672</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197672</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0f1:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197471</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego A.

In mountainous landscapes, soil moisture is highly dynamic due to the effects of topography and the temporal variability imposed by seasonal precipitation, including rainfall and snow. Soil moisture is known to affect ecosystem carbon exchange both aboveground and belowground, as well as the stable isotopic composition of exchanged CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this study we used an extensive suite of measurements to examine the effects of seasonal changes in soil moisture on the isotopic composition of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production at the landscape level. We show that the seasonal decline in soil moisture (i.e., summer dry-down) appeared to impose a trend in the δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) with more negative δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; early in the growing season when soils were wet, and more positive δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; as the growing season progressed and soils dried out. This seemingly generalizable pattern for a snow-dominated watershed is likely to represent the variability of recently assimilated C, tracked through the plant-soil system and imprinted in the respired CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, our observations suggest that, at least for mountainous environments, seasonal changes in δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; are largely mediated by soil moisture and their spatial variability is partially organized by topography.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197471</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Summer dry-down modulates the isotopic composition of soil CO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; production in snow-dominated landscapes</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Diego A.

Sulphonylurea drugs stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells primarily by inhibiting ATP sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channels in the β-cell membrane. The effective sulphonylurea concentration at its site of action is significantly attenuated by binding to serum albumin, which makes it difficult to compare &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. We therefore measured the ability of gliclazide and glibenclamide to inhibit K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of serum albumin. We used this data, together with estimates of free drug concentrations from binding studies, to predict the extent of sulphonylurea inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels at therapeutic concentrations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents from mouse pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes were measured using the patch-clamp technique. Gliclazide and glibenclamide binding to human plasma were determined in spiked plasma samples using an ultrafiltration-mass spectrometry approach. Bovine serum albumin (60g/l) produced a mild, non-significant reduction of gliclazide block of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents in pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration &amp;lt;0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect. In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Binding of sulphonylureas to plasma proteins – A K&amp;lt;sub&gt;ATP&amp;lt;/sub&gt; channel perspective</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Proks, Holger Kramer, Elizabeth Haythorne, Frances M.

In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Peter Proks</name></author><fingerprint>9be6efb0</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>107</engagement><crawled>1525867792824</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16344cec9b8:b01c27:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05062-8</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kenya and Ghana set up national research funding schemes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenya and Ghana set up national research funding schemes, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05062-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05062-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Kenya and Ghana set up national research funding schemes</description><published>1525849200000</published><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05062-8</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kenya and Ghana set up national research funding schemes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenya and Ghana set up national research funding schemes, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05062-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05062-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Kenya and Ghana set up national research funding schemes</content></content><title>Kenya and Ghana set up national research funding schemes</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>Thomas K.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Although locally invasive or recurrent fibromatosis is primarily treated with surgery, radiotherapy (RT) produces local control for recurrent/unresectable tumors or those with positive surgical margins. Herein, we describe our updated institutional experience with RT to treat fibromatosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven patients with fibromatosis received RT between 1990 and 2015, and were followed for ≥12 months. Eight patients received RT for gross tumors, and 39 received postoperative RT after single/multiple prior surgeries. A median dose of 54 Gy was prescribed for definitive RT; 48.6, 50.4, and 54 Gy were prescribed for R0, R1, and R2 resected tumors, respectively. Recurrences were classified as in-field, marginal, or out-field. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven recurrences were noted, including 2 in-field, 4 marginal, and 1 out-field, after a median follow-up of 60 months. In-field recurrences occurred in 1 patient who received 40.5 Gy of salvage RT after postoperative recurrence and another who received 45 Gy for R1 resection after multiple prior operations. All marginal failures were due to insufficient clinical target volume (CTV) margins regardless of dose (3 with 45 Gy and 1 with 54 Gy). On multivariate analysis, a CTV margin ≥5 cm and dose &gt;45 Gy were significant predictors of non-recurrence (p = 0.039 and 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with both an CTV margin ≥5 cm and a dose &gt;45 Gy showed a favorable outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RT is a valuable option for treating aggressive fibromatosis; doses ≥45 Gy and a large field produce optimal results. For in-field control, a higher dose is more necessary for gross residual tumors than for totally excised lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198134</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Optimal radiotherapy strategy for primary or recurrent fibromatosis and long-term results</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seo Hee Choi, Hong In Yoon, Seung Hyun Kim, Sang Kyum Kim, Kyoo-Ho Shin, Chang-Ok Suh&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The topical HIV prevention (microbicides) field is in acute need of a method to rapidly and objectively measure adherence to product use in clinical trials. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy has been used in many pharmaceutical and forensic applications but has yet to be applied to adherence monitoring. In this study, we report on efforts to test the feasibility of using IR spectroscopy as a means to measure residual active or placebo vaginal product, semen exposure and vaginal insertion from a single swab.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A portable IR spectrometer equipped with diamond attenuated total reflectance (ATR) was used to capture spectra of unused vs. vaginally-used swabs, vaginal swabs containing semen, and vaginal swabs to which either tenofovir-containing or matching placebo products (vaginal gel or insert) were added. Spectral data obtained from swabs placed directly on the spectrometer were divided into calibration and testing sets for developing and validating discriminant models set up to provide yes/no predictions of: vaginal vs. non-vaginal use, presence vs. no presence of each test product, and presence vs. no presence of semen. Further validation of models was performed using vaginal swabs collected from a clinical study evaluating vaginally administered placebo insert formulations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For each discriminant model developed to predict vaginal vs. non-vaginal use, presence vs. no presence of each test product, and presence vs. no presence of semen, classified validation samples not included in the model development were correctly identified into their respective classes with minimal prediction error. Clinically obtained vaginal swabs collected 15–60 minutes after placebo insert use were also correctly identified, further validating the models.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate the proof of concept that IR spectroscopy can be a method for rapid detection and characterization of microbicide products and biological fluids present in vaginal swabs.

Benthic algae fuel summer food webs in many sunlit rivers, and are hotspots for primary and secondary production and biogeochemical cycling. Concerningly, riverine benthic algal assemblages can become dominated by toxic cyanobacteria, threatening water quality and public health. In the Eel River in Northern California, over a dozen dog deaths have been attributed to cyanotoxin poisonings since 2000. During the summers of 2013–2015, we documented spatial and temporal patterns of cyanotoxin concentrations in the watershed, showing widespread distribution of anatoxin-a in benthic cyanobacterial mats. Solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) samplers were deployed weekly to record dissolved microcystin and anatoxin-a levels at 10 sites throughout the watershed, and 187 &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt;-dominated or &lt;i&gt;Phormidium-&lt;/i&gt;dominated cyanobacterial mat samples were collected from 27 locations to measure intracellular anatoxin-a (ATX) and microcystins (MCY). Anatoxin-a levels were higher than microcystin for both SPATT (mean MCY = 0.8 and ATX = 4.8 ng g resin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and cyanobacterial mat samples (mean MCY = 0.074 and ATX = 1.89 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). Of the benthic mats sampled, 58.9% had detectable anatoxin-a (max = 70.93 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW), while 37.6% had detectable microcystins (max = 2.29 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). SPATT cyanotoxin levels peaked in mid-summer in warm mainstem reaches of the watershed. This is one of the first documentations of widespread anatoxin-a occurrence in benthic cyanobacterial mats in a North American watershed.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197669</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Widespread anatoxin-a detection in benthic cyanobacterial mats throughout a river network</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Keith Bouma-Gregson, Raphael M.

This is one of the first documentations of widespread anatoxin-a occurrence in benthic cyanobacterial mats in a North American watershed.</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Keith Bouma-Gregson</name></author><fingerprint>b40a272a</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197669</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197669</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b03490/20180525/images/medium/jp-2018-03490s_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03490&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Non-contact heart rate (HR) measurement from facial videos has attracted high interests due to its convenience and cost effectiveness. However, accurate and robust HR estimation under various realistic scenarios remain a very challenging problem. In this paper, we develop a novel system which can achieve a robust and accurate HR estimation under those challenging scenarios. First, to minimize tracking-artifacts arising from large head motions and facial expressions, we propose a joint face detection and alignment method which can produce alignment-friendly facial bounding boxes with reliable initial facial shapes, facilitating accurate and robust face alignment even in the presence of large pose variations and expressions. Second, different from most existing methods [1–5] which derive pulse signals from predetermined grid cells (i.e. local patches), our patches are varying-sized triangles generated adaptively to exclude negative effects from non-rigid facial motions. Third, we propose an adaptive patch selection method to choose patches which contain skin regions and are more likely to contain useful information, followed by an independent component analysis, for an accurate HR estimate. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our own dataset demonstrated that, comparing with the state-of-the-art methods [1–3], our method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by a large margin, ranging from 12% to 63%, and can provide a robust and accurate estimation under various challenging scenarios.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197275</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Accurate face alignment and adaptive patch selection for heart rate estimation from videos under realistic scenarios</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhiwei Wang, Xin Yang, Kwang-Ting Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

S100A16 is a conserved member of the S100 protein family in mammals. Its upregulation was observed in many tumors and is related to malignant transformation. In this study, we explored the independent prognostic value of &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by performing a retrospective study, using data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Besides, by using deep sequencing data in TCGA-LUAD, we also explored the association between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation and copy number alterations (CNAs). Results showed that the primary LUAD tissues (N = 514) had significantly elevated &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression compared with the normal lung tissues (N = 59). Based on OS data of 502 primary LUAD cases, we found that high &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was correlated with inferior OS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.197, 95%CI: 1.050–1.364, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) and RFS (HR: 1.206, 95%CI: 1.045–1.393, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011). By examining the DNA methylation data in TCGA-LUAD, we found that some &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; DNA CpG sites were generally hypermethylated in normal tissues, but not in LUAD tissues. Regression analysis identified a moderately negative correlation between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation. In comparison, although DNA amplification (+1/+2) was frequent (378/511, 74%) in LUAD patients, it was not associated with increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression. Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197402</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Aberrant &amp;lt;i&gt;S100A16&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression might be an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable survival in non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by De Chen, Linjie Luo, Chao Liang&lt;/p&gt;

We discuss generalizations of our algorithmic techniques to other hidden Markov models.</content></content><title>An average-case sublinear exact Li and Stephens forward algorithm [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Rosen, Y.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/15/322396</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322396v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526635169773</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163728c07ed:5098e74:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26290-y</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Electronic states of deep trap levels in a-plane GaN templates grown on r-plane sapphire by HVPE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electronic states of deep trap levels in a-plane GaN templates grown on r-plane sapphire by HVPE, Published online: 18 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26290-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26290-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Electronic states of deep trap levels in a-plane GaN templates grown on r-plane sapphire by HVPE&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Wk6YoH6weYs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526626800000</published><fingerprint>e09c05ff</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26290-y</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Electronic states of deep trap levels in a-plane GaN templates grown on r-plane sapphire by HVPE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electronic states of deep trap levels in a-plane GaN templates grown on r-plane sapphire by HVPE, Published online: 18 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26290-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26290-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Electronic states of deep trap levels in a-plane GaN templates grown on r-plane sapphire by HVPE&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Wk6YoH6weYs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Electronic states of deep trap levels in a-plane GaN templates grown on r-plane sapphire by HVPE</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26290-y/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26290_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><height>260</height></visual><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Moonsang Lee</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26290-y</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/Wk6YoH6weYs/s41598-018-26290-y</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527067477764</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1638c508704:7447da5:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04110-1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Targeting RNA structure in &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; reverses spinal muscular atrophy molecular phenotypes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting RNA structure in &amp;lt;i&gt;SMN2&amp;lt;/i&gt; reverses spinal muscular atrophy molecular phenotypes, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04110-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04110-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder with no present cure.

Ramie (&lt;i&gt;Boehmeria nivea&lt;/i&gt; L. Gaud) fiber, one of the most important natural fibers, is extracted from stem bark. Continuous cropping is the main obstacle to ramie stem growth and a major cause of reduced yields. Root-associated microbes play crucial roles in plant growth and health. In this study, we investigated differences between microbial communities in the soil of healthy and continuously cropped ramie plants, and sought to identify potential mechanisms whereby these communities could counteract the problems posed by continuous cropping. Paired-end Illumina MiSeq analysis of 16S rRNA and ITS gene amplicons was employed to study bacterial and fungal communities. Long-term monoculture of ramie significantly decreased fiber yields and altered soil microbial communities. Our findings revealed how microbial communities and functional diversity varied according to the planting year and plant health status. Soil bacterial diversity increased with the period of ramie monoculture, whereas no significant differences were observed for fungi. Sequence analyses revealed that &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acidobacteria&lt;/i&gt; were the most abundant bacterial phyla. &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; abundance decreased with the period of ramie monoculture and correlated positively with the stem length, stem diameter, and fiber yield. The &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Chloroflexi&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/i&gt; phyla exhibited a significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) negative correlation with yields during continuous cultivation. Some &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt; members showed reduced microbial diversity, which prevented continuous ramie cropping. &lt;i&gt;Ascomycota&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Basidiomycota&lt;/i&gt; were the main fungal phyla. The relatively high abundance of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; observed in healthy ramie may contribute to disease suppression, thereby promoting ramie growth. In summary, soil weakness and increased disease in ramie plants after long-term continuous cropping can be attributed to changes in soil microbes, a reduction in beneficial microbes, and an accumulation of harmful microbes.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197095</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Potential use of high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities for estimating the adverse effects of continuous cropping on ramie (&amp;lt;i&gt;Boehmeria nivea&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.

The adipose tissue (AT) contributes to systemic and B cell intrinsic inflammation, reduced B cell responses and secretion of autoimmune antibodies. In this study we show that adipocytes in the human obese subcutaneous AT (SAT) secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation, and consequent suboptimal immune responses in obese individuals, as we have previously shown. We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies. During the development of obesity, reduced oxygen and consequent hypoxia and cell death lead to further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, “self” protein antigens, cell-free DNA and lipids. All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of “self” antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197472</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Secretion of autoimmune antibodies in the human subcutaneous adipose tissue</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Frasca, Alain Diaz, Maria Romero, Seth Thaller, Bonnie B.

American Indians (AI) have high prevalence of diabetes in youth and may benefit from increasing physical activity as a strategy to improve metabolic health. We tested whether financial incentives would elicit greater frequency and/or duration of exercise in AI youth at high risk for developing diabetes. Overweight/obese AI boys and girls, 11–20 years old, were instructed to exercise on 3 days/week for 48 weeks at a tribal wellness center. The program was divided into three, 16-week-long phases to test different financial incentive strategies. Within each phase participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups that received different payments for exercise. Phase 1 was designed to test whether the size of the incentive would affect exercise frequency. In Phase 1, the number of exercise sessions did not differ between the group receiving a modest fixed-value payment per exercise session and the group receiving enhanced incentives to exercise more frequently (26 ± 3 versus 28 ± 2 sessions, respectively, p = 0.568). In Phase 2, the provision of an enhanced financial incentive to increase exercise duration resulted longer sessions, as the incentivized and standard payment groups exercised 38 ± 2 versus 29 ± 1 minutes per session (p = 0.002), respectively. In Phase 3, the effect of reducing the incentives on maintenance of exercise behaviors was inconclusive due to high participant withdrawal. Aerobic fitness increased 10% during Phase 1 but was unchanged thereafter. Insulin sensitivity and body composition were unchanged during the study. In conclusion, enhanced financial incentives increased the duration of exercise sessions, but had minimal effects on exercise participation. These results indicate that financial incentives hold promise in motivating previously sedentary, overweight/obese adolescents to exercise longer, but motivating them to sustain an exercise program remains the major challenge.

The 2009 influenza pandemic, the variant H3N2v viruses in agricultural fairs and the zoonotic poultry H5N9 infections in China have highlighted the constant threat that influenza A viruses (IAV) present to people and animals. In this study we evaluated the effect of IAV vaccination on aerosol shedding in pigs housed in warm environmental conditions. Thirty-six, three-week old weaned pigs were obtained from an IAV negative herd and were randomly allocated to one of 4 groups: 1) a homologous vaccine group, 2) a heterologous multivalent vaccine group, 3) a heterologous monovalent group and, 4) a non-vaccinated group. After vaccination pigs were challenged with the triple reassortant A/Sw/IA/00239/04 H1N1 virus. Environmental temperature and relative humidity were recorded throughout the study. Nasal swabs, oral fluids and air samples were collected daily. All samples were tested by RRT-PCR and virus isolation was attempted on positive samples. Average temperature and relative humidity throughout the study were 27°C (80°F) and 53%, respectively. A significantly higher proportion of infected pigs was detected in the non-vaccinated than in the vaccinated group. Lower levels of nasal virus shedding were found in vaccinated groups compared to non-vaccinated group and IAV was not detected in air samples of any of the vaccinated groups. In contrast, positive air samples were detected in the non-vaccinated group at 1, 2 and 3 days post infection although the overall levels were considered low most likely due to the elevated environmental temperature. In conclusion, both the decrease in shedding and the increase in environmental temperature may have contributed to the inability to detect airborne IAV in vaccinated pigs.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197600</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Detection of influenza A virus in aerosols of vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs in a warm environment</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Victor Neira, Matt Allerson, Cesar Corzo, Marie Culhane, Aaron Rendahl, Montserrat Torremorell&lt;/p&gt;

As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/627.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/627?rss=1</href></item></alternate><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/627?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>23</engagement><crawled>1527678911241</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163b0c24309:262af12:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05270-2</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thousands urge US science academy to revoke membership for sexual harassers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands urge US science academy to revoke membership for sexual harassers, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05270-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05270-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Online petition seeks fresh standards for professional conduct.</description><published>1527663600000</published><engagementRate>0.19</engagementRate><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05270-2</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thousands urge US science academy to revoke membership for sexual harassers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands urge US science academy to revoke membership for sexual harassers, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05270-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05270-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Online petition seeks fresh standards for professional conduct.</content></content><title>Thousands urge US science academy to revoke membership for sexual harassers</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><fingerprint>ea12ac1b</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05270-2</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>363</engagement><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d0992:2835af05</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/1028?rss=1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;Opportunities to directly study the founding of a human population and its subsequent evolutionary history are rare.

ZFP36 RBPs are prominent inflammatory regulators linked to autoimmunity and cancer, but functions in adaptive immunity are less clear. We used HITS-CLIP to define ZFP36 targets in mouse T cells, revealing unanticipated actions in regulating T cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions. Transcriptome and ribosome profiling showed that ZFP36 represses mRNA target abundance and translation, notably through novel AU-rich sites in coding sequence.

ZFP36 RBPs are prominent inflammatory regulators linked to autoimmunity and cancer, but functions in adaptive immunity are less clear. We used HITS-CLIP to define ZFP36 targets in mouse T cells, revealing unanticipated actions in regulating T cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions. Transcriptome and ribosome profiling showed that ZFP36 represses mRNA target abundance and translation, notably through novel AU-rich sites in coding sequence. Functional studies revealed that ZFP36 regulates early T cell activation kinetics cell autonomously, by attenuating activation marker expression, limiting T cell expansion, and promoting apoptosis. Strikingly, loss of ZFP36 in vivo accelerated T cell responses to acute viral infection and enhanced anti-viral immunity.

Endothelial cells play an essential role in regulating an immune response through promoting leukocyte adhesion and cell migration and production of cytokines such as TNFα. Regulation of endothelial cell immune function is tightly regulated and recent studies suggest that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are prominently involved in this process. However, the importance of EVs in regulating endothelial activation in the context of a bacterial infection is poorly understood. To begin addressing this knowledge gap we characterized the endothelial cell response to EVs released from &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;) infected macrophages. Our result showed increased macrophage migration through the monolayer when endothelial cells were pretreated with EVs isolated from &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;-infected macrophages. Transcriptome analysis showed a significant upregulation of genes involved in cell adhesion and the inflammatory process in endothelial cells treated with EVs. These results were validated by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated that several immune response-related pathways were up-regulated. Endothelial cells were also treated with EVs isolated from the serum of &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice. Interestingly, EVs isolated 14 days but not 7 or 21 days post-infection showed a similar ability to induce endothelial cell activation suggesting a change in EV function during the course of an &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; infection. Immunofluorescence microscopy result indicated that NF-κB and the Type 1 interferon pathways were involved in endothelial activation by EVs. In summary, our data suggest that EVs can activate endothelial cells and thus may play an important role in modulating host immune responses during an &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; infection.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198337</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Activation of endothelial cells by extracellular vesicles derived from &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&amp;lt;/i&gt; infected macrophages or mice</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Li Li, Yong Cheng, Scott Emrich, Jeffrey Schorey&lt;/p&gt;

A pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-specific receptor, PAC1R, is coupled with multiple signal transduction pathways including stimulation of adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. PAC1R has been shown to exert its long-lasting and potent signals via β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. However, the precise roles of the two β-arrestin isoforms in PACAP-PAC1R signaling remain unclear. Here we examined the interaction between the two β-arrestin isoforms and PAC1R, β-arrestin-dependent PAC1R subcellular localization and ERK1/2 activation. Upon PACAP stimulation, although PAC1R similarly interacted with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in HEK293T cells, the complex of PAC1R and β-arrestin2 was translocated from the cell surface into cytosol, but that of β-arrestin1 remained in the cell surface regions in HeLa cells and mouse primary cultured neurons. Silencing of β-arrestin2 blocked PACAP-induced PAC1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but silencing of β-arrestin1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>β-Arrestin1 and 2 differentially regulate PACAP-induced PAC1 receptor signaling and trafficking</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yusuke Shintani, Atsuko Hayata-Takano, Keita Moriguchi, Takanobu Nakazawa, Yukio Ago, Atsushi Kasai, Kaoru Seiriki, Norihito Shintani, Hitoshi Hashimoto&lt;/p&gt;

These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</content></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Yusuke Shintani</name></author><fingerprint>baacc1f2</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526981344788</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163872e3e14:6d409f4:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04419-x</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plasma membrane LAT activation precedes vesicular recruitment defining two phases of early T-cell activation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasma membrane LAT activation precedes vesicular recruitment defining two phases of early T-cell activation, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04419-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04419-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Controversy exists over the function of plasma membrane versus intracellular vesicular LAT in T-cell receptor signaling.

Dairy farming is one the most important sectors of United Kingdom (UK) agriculture. It faces major challenges due to climate change, which will have direct impacts on dairy cows as a result of heat stress. In the absence of adaptations, this could potentially lead to considerable milk loss. Using an 11-member climate projection ensemble, as well as an ensemble of 18 milk loss estimation methods, temporal changes in milk production of UK dairy cows were estimated for the 21st century at a 25 km resolution in a spatially-explicit way. While increases in UK temperatures are projected to lead to relatively low average annual milk losses, even for southern UK regions (&amp;lt;180 kg/cow), the ‘hottest’ 25×25 km grid cell in the hottest year in the 2090s, showed an annual milk loss exceeding 1300 kg/cow. This figure represents approximately 17% of the potential milk production of today’s average cow. Despite the potential considerable inter-annual variability of annual milk loss, as well as the large differences between the climate projections, the variety of calculation methods is likely to introduce even greater uncertainty into milk loss estimations. To address this issue, a novel, more biologically-appropriate mechanism of estimating milk loss is proposed that provides more realistic future projections. We conclude that South West England is the region most vulnerable to climate change economically, because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore potentially high heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach £13.4M in average years and £33.8M in extreme years.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197076</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Spatially explicit estimation of heat stress-related impacts of climate change on the milk production of dairy cows in the United Kingdom</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nándor Fodor, Andreas Foskolos, Cairistiona F.

Determining how proteins interact to form stable complexes is of crucial importance, for example in the development of novel therapeutics. Computational methods to determine the thermodynamically stable conformation of complexes from the structure of the binding partners, such as RosettaDock, might potentially emerge to become a promising alternative to traditional structure determination methods. However, while models virtually identical to the correct experimental structure can in some cases be generated, the main difficulty remains to discriminate correct or approximately correct models from decoys. This is due to the ruggedness of the free-energy landscape, the approximations intrinsic in the scoring functions, and the intrinsic flexibility of proteins. Here we show that molecular dynamics simulations performed starting from a number top-scoring models can not only discriminate decoys and identify the correct structure, but may also provide information on an initial map of the free energy landscape that elucidates the binding mechanism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nukuSUmhrVc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1528146000000</published><fingerprint>3ed10a8b</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006182</link><title>Assessment of &amp;lt;i&gt;ab initio&amp;lt;/i&gt; models of protein complexes by molecular dynamics</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Filip Radom, Andreas Plückthun, Emanuele Paci&lt;/p&gt;

Gene expression in eukaryotes is controlled by DNA sequences at promoter and enhancer regions, whose accessibility for binding by regulatory proteins dictates their specific patterns of activity. Here, we identify the protein Zbtb7a as a factor required for inducible changes in accessibility driven by transcription factors (TFs). We show that Zbtb7a binds to a significant fraction of genomic promoters and enhancers, encompassing many target genes of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) p65 and a variety of other TFs. While Zbtb7a binding is not alone sufficient to directly activate promoters, it is required to enable TF-dependent control of accessibility and normal gene expression. Using p65 as a model TF, we show that Zbtb7a associates with promoters independently of client TF binding. Moreover, the presence of prebound Zbtb7a can specify promoters that are amenable to TF-induced changes in accessibility. Therefore, Zbtb7a represents a widely used promoter factor that transduces signals from other TFs to enable control of accessibility and regulation of gene expression.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0hCOgv8f0oI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><fingerprint>8694d8b7</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004526</link><title>Zbtb7a is a transducer for the control of promoter accessibility by NF-kappa B and multiple other transcription factors</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by José Miguel Ramos Pittol, Agata Oruba, Gerhard Mittler, Simona Saccani, Dominic van Essen&lt;/p&gt;
Gene expression in eukaryotes is controlled by DNA sequences at promoter and enhancer regions, whose accessibility for binding by regulatory proteins dictates their specific patterns of activity. Here, we identify the protein Zbtb7a as a factor required for inducible changes in accessibility driven by transcription factors (TFs). We show that Zbtb7a binds to a significant fraction of genomic promoters and enhancers, encompassing many target genes of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) p65 and a variety of other TFs. While Zbtb7a binding is not alone sufficient to directly activate promoters, it is required to enable TF-dependent control of accessibility and normal gene expression. Using p65 as a model TF, we show that Zbtb7a associates with promoters independently of client TF binding. Moreover, the presence of prebound Zbtb7a can specify promoters that are amenable to TF-induced changes in accessibility. Therefore, Zbtb7a represents a widely used promoter factor that transduces signals from other TFs to enable control of accessibility and regulation of gene expression.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0hCOgv8f0oI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1527627600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><author><name>José Miguel Ramos Pittol</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004526</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/0hCOgv8f0oI/article</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1527623103626</recrawled></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d09b9:2835af05</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/971?rss=1</originId><published>1527788426000</published><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/971.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Oceanography</item></keywords><title>The accessible predator</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Baird, R.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response. Bovine NK-lysins, a type of AMP, have been predominantly found in the granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells. Bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides demonstrate antimicrobial activity against various bacterial pathogens, including several involved in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in cattle; however, such studies are yet to be performed with one important contributor to the BRDC, &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Thirty-mer synthetic peptides corresponding to the functional region helices 2 and 3 of bovine NK-lysins NK1, NK2A, NK2B, and NK2C were evaluated for killing activity on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Among four peptides, NK2A and NK2C showed the highest antimicrobial activity against the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested. All four NK-lysin peptides induced rapid plasma membrane depolarization in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; at two concentrations tested.

Confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy further suggested NK-lysin-induced damage to the plasma membrane.

Population dynamics in urban and rural areas are different. Understanding factors that contribute to local population changes has various socioeconomic and political implications. In the present study, we use population census data in Japan to examine contributors to the population growth of residential clusters between years 2005 and 2010. The data set covers the entirety of Japan and has a high spatial resolution of 500 × 500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, enabling us to examine population dynamics in various parts of the country (urban and rural) using statistical analysis. We found that, in addition to the area, population density, and age, the shape of the cluster and the spatial distribution of inhabitants within the cluster are significantly related to the population growth rate of a residential cluster. Specifically, the population tends to grow if the cluster is &amp;quot;round&amp;quot; shaped (given the area) and the population is concentrated near the center rather than periphery of the cluster. Combination of the present results and analysis framework with other factors that have been omitted in the present study, such as migration, terrain, and transportation infrastructure, will be fruitful.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197144</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Population changes in residential clusters in Japan</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takuya Sekiguchi, Kohei Tamura, Naoki Masuda&lt;/p&gt;

In this study, we found that strain LM2303 had strong antagonist activity against &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt; and significantly reduced disease severity of FHB with the control efficiency of 72.3% under field conditions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the biocontrol potential of strain LM2303 against FHB, an integrated approach of genome mining and chemical analysis was employed. The whole genome of strain LM2303 was obtained and analyzed, showing the largest number of genes/gene clusters associated with biocontrol functions as compared with the known biocontrol strains (FZB42, M75, CAU B946). And strain LM2303 was accurately determined as a member of the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;velezensis&lt;/i&gt; clade using the phylogenomic analysis of single-copy core genes. Through genome mining, 13 biosynthetic gene clusters(BGCs) encoding secondary metabolites with biocontrol functions were identified, which were further confirmed through chemical analyses such as UHPLC-ESI-MS, including three antifungal metabolites (fengycin B, iturin A, and surfactin A), eight antibacterial metabolites (surfactin A, butirosin, plantazolicin and hydrolyzed plantazolicin, kijanimicin, bacilysin, difficidin, bacillaene A and bacillaene B, 7-o-malonyl macrolactin A and 7-o-succinyl macrolactin A), the siderophore bacillibactin, molybdenum cofactor and teichuronic acid. In addition, genes/gene clusters involved in plant colonization, plant growth promotion and induced systemic resistance were also found and analyzed, along with the corresponding metabolites. Finally, four different mechanisms of strain LM2303 involved in the biocontrol of FHB were putatively obtained. This work provides better insights into a mechanistic understanding of strain LM2303 in control of FHB, reinforcing the higher potential of this strain as a powerful biocontrol strain agent (BCA) for FHB control.

The results also provide scientific reference and comparison for other biocontrol strains.</content></content><updated>1527886800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Liang Chen</name></author><fingerprint>9ab87bd2</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198560</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198560</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526548636221</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1636d63a23d:48fc37c:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46976</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrigendum: Identification and Characterisation of a pH-stable GFP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum: Identification and Characterisation of a pH-stable GFP, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46976&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/srep46976&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Corrigendum: Identification and Characterisation of a pH-stable GFP&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/DQzGpFOnXTo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526540400000</published><fingerprint>31987948</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46976</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrigendum: Identification and Characterisation of a pH-stable GFP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum: Identification and Characterisation of a pH-stable GFP, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46976&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/srep46976&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Corrigendum: Identification and Characterisation of a pH-stable GFP&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/DQzGpFOnXTo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Corrigendum: Identification and Characterisation of a pH-stable GFP</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Tania Michelle Roberts</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46976</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/DQzGpFOnXTo/srep46976</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527098051028</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1638e2309d4:7906e5b:2835af05</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328740v2?rss=1</originId><description>Motivation: Taxonomic classification is at the core of environmental DNA analysis.

The main purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of a 12-week water aerobics program in a real-life context on health indicators and physical fitness in adults and older adults. Fifteen volunteers (58.80 ± 14.32 years old) were part of an experimental group (Exercise), and eight volunteers (59.00 ± 12.26 years old) were part of the control group (Control). The Exercise performed 45 min of water aerobics twice a week for 12 weeks; no physical exercise was permitted for the Control during the same period. The evaluations were performed the week before (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training). The primary outcomes were the strength and cardiorespiratory fitness variables and the secondary outcomes included body anthropometry, lipid profile and blood pressure. Adjusted analysis for age and baseline values showed no differences between Exercise and Control in post-training moment. However, there was a moderated tendency for increased explosive strength of the upper limbs (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced body fat (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced systolic blood pressure (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.14) and triglycerides (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19) in Exercise. Within groups changes showed that the training program caused an increase mainly in explosive strength in the upper limbs (0.26 m, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.49; ES = 0.63) In addition, there was a significant decrease in fat mass (-0.89%, 95% CI, -1.74, -0.03; ES = 0.61) and in the systolic blood pressure (-0.83 mmHg, -1.46, -0.19; ES = 0.71). Nonetheless, no significant changes were observed for the lipid profile. These results suggest that 12 weeks of water aerobics performed twice a week in a real-life context seem to benefit the explosive strength, body composition, and blood pressure of adults and older adults but is insufficient to alter cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profiles.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198319</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The effect of 12 weeks of water-aerobics on health status and physical fitness: An ecological approach</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Henrique Pereira Neiva, Luís Brandão Faíl, Mikel Izquierdo, Mário C.

By providing a view of the underlying network structure, we aim to help pathway analysis users manage their expectations and better identify possible artefacts in the results.</content></content><title>Analysing the structure of pathways and its influence on the interpretation of biomedical datasets [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Burger, B.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/30/333492</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333492v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527718546715</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163b31f0d1b:2b37b09:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26886-4</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Investigation of Dietary Factors and Esophageal Cancer Knowledge: Comparison of Rural Residents in High- and Low-incidence Areas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Investigation of Dietary Factors and Esophageal Cancer Knowledge: Comparison of Rural Residents in High- and Low-incidence Areas, Published online: 31 May 2018;

Gelsolin (GSN) protein, expressed in circulating monocytes, was previously reported to be associated with osteoporosis in both Chinese and Caucasian women. This study aims to test if plasma GSN protein level is associated with hip bone mineral density (BMD) in Chinese population. Based on two study Groups containing 6,308 old Chinese, we adopted extreme sampling scheme and selected 3 independent samples (Subgroups 1–3) for discovery, replication, and validation purposes. We tested plasma GSN concentration, and analyzed whether plasma GSN level differs between subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD. In Group 1 (N = 1,860), the plasma GSN level increased in the female with low BMD, which was discovered in the Subgroup 1 (N = 42, p = 0.093) and replicated in the Subgroup 2 (N = 39, p = 0.095). With more extreme sampling for the Subgroup 3 from the Group 2 (N = 4,448), the difference of plasma GSN level in the female with low BMD vs. high BMD is more significant (N = 45, p = 0.037). After the subjects were pooled from Subgroups 2 and 3, the difference in plasma GSN between low and high BMD subjects became even more significant (p = 0.016). The plasma GSN level was negatively correlated with total hip BMD (r = -0.26, p = 0.033). We concluded that plasma GSN was associated with hip BMD in Chinese postmenopausal women and plasma GSN might be a potential risk biomarker for osteoporosis.</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197732</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Plasma gelsolin is associated with hip BMD in Chinese postmenopausal women</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Yu Wang, Bing Ge, Ju Shi, Xu Zhou, Long-Fei Wu, Chang-Hua Tang, Dong-Cheng Zhu, Hong Zhu, Xing-Bo Mo, Yong-Hong Zhang, Fei-Yan Deng, Shu-Feng Lei&lt;/p&gt;

Enzastaurin is a Protein Kinase C-β selective inhibitor that was developed to treat cancers. Protein Kinase C-β is an important enzyme for a variety of neuronal functions; in particular, previous rodent studies have reported deficits in spatial and fear-conditioned learning and memory with lower levels of Protein Kinase C-β. Due to Enzastaurin’s mechanism of action, the present study investigated the consequences of Enzastaurin exposure on learning and memory in 12-month-old Fischer-344 male rats. Rats were treated daily with subcutaneous injections of either vehicle or Enzastaurin, and behaviorally tested using the spatial reference memory Morris Water Maze. Rats treated with Enzastaurin exhibited decreased overnight retention and poorer performance on the latter testing day, indicating a mild, but significant, memory impairment. There were no differences during the probe trial indicating that all animals were able to spatially localize the platform to the proper quadrant by the end of testing. RNA isolated from the hippocampus was analyzed using Next Generation Sequencing (Illumina). No statistically significant transcriptional differences were noted. Our findings suggest that acute Enzastaurin treatment can impair hippocampal-based learning and memory performance, with no effects on transcription in the hippocampus. We propose that care should be taken in future clinical trials that utilize Protein Kinase C-ß inhibitors, to monitor for possible cognitive effects, future research should examine if these effects are fully reversible.</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The PKC-β selective inhibitor, Enzastaurin, impairs memory in middle-aged rats</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mari N.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Glucagon like-peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists diminish appetite and may contribute to the weight loss in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to determine, for the first time, the expression of GLP-1R by colon nerve fibres in patients with IBD, and functional effects of its agonists in cultured rat and human sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;GLP-1R and other nerve markers were studied by immunohistochemistry in colon biopsies from patients with IBD (n = 16) and controls (n = 8), human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissue, and in GLP-1R transfected HEK293 cells. The morphological effects of incretin hormones oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and glucagon were studied on neurite extension in cultured DRG neurons, and their functional effects on capsaicin and ATP signalling, using calcium imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significantly increased numbers of colonic mucosal nerve fibres were observed in IBD biopsies expressing GLP-1R (p = 0.0013), the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 (p = 0.0008), and sensory neuropeptide CGRP (p = 0.0014). An increase of GLP-1R positive nerve fibres in IBD colon was confirmed with a different antibody to GLP-1R (p = 0.016). GLP-1R immunostaining was intensely positive in small and medium-sized neurons in human DRG, and in human and rat DRG cultured neurons. Co-localization of GLP-1R expression with neuronal markers in colon and DRG confirmed the neural expression of GLP-1R, and antibody specificity was confirmed in HEK293 cells transfected with the GLP-1R. Treatment with oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and GLP-1 increased neurite length in cultured neurons compared with controls, but did not stimulate calcium influx directly, or affect capsaicin responses. However, exendin-4 significantly enhanced ATP responses in human DRG neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results show that increased GLP-1R innervation in IBD bowel could mediate enhanced visceral afferent signalling, and provide a peripheral target for therapeutic intervention. The differential effect of GLP-1R agonists on capsaicin and ATP responses in neurons suggest they may not affect pain mechanisms mediated by the capsaicin receptor TRPV1, but may enhance the effects of purinergic agonists.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198024</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) expression by nerve fibres in inflammatory bowel disease and functional effects in cultured neurons</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Uma Anand, Yiangos Yiangou, Ayesha Akbar, Tom Quick, Anthony MacQuillan, Mike Fox, Marco Sinisi, Yuri E.

An increase of GLP-1R positive nerve fibres in IBD colon was confirmed with a different antibody to GLP-1R (p = 0.016). GLP-1R immunostaining was intensely positive in small and medium-sized neurons in human DRG, and in human and rat DRG cultured neurons. Co-localization of GLP-1R expression with neuronal markers in colon and DRG confirmed the neural expression of GLP-1R, and antibody specificity was confirmed in HEK293 cells transfected with the GLP-1R. Treatment with oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and GLP-1 increased neurite length in cultured neurons compared with controls, but did not stimulate calcium influx directly, or affect capsaicin responses. However, exendin-4 significantly enhanced ATP responses in human DRG neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results show that increased GLP-1R innervation in IBD bowel could mediate enhanced visceral afferent signalling, and provide a peripheral target for therapeutic intervention. The differential effect of GLP-1R agonists on capsaicin and ATP responses in neurons suggest they may not affect pain mechanisms mediated by the capsaicin receptor TRPV1, but may enhance the effects of purinergic agonists.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527627600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Uma Anand</name></author><fingerprint>fcf3b63d</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198024</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198024</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Morphology modulation offers significant control over organic electronic device performance.

BK virus (BKV) associated nephropathy affects 1–10% of kidney transplant recipients, leading to graft failure in about 50% of cases. Immune responses against different BKV antigens have been shown to have a prognostic value for disease development. Data currently suggest that the structural antigens and regulatory antigens of BKV might each trigger a different mode of action of the immune response. To study the influence of different modes of action of the cellular immune response on BKV clearance dynamics, we have analysed the kinetics of BKV plasma load and anti-BKV T cell response (Elispot) in six patients with BKV associated nephropathy using ODE modelling. The results show that only a small number of hypotheses on the mode of action are compatible with the empirical data. The hypothesis with the highest empirical support is that structural antigens trigger blocking of virus production from infected cells, whereas regulatory antigens trigger an acceleration of death of infected cells. These differential modes of action could be important for our understanding of BKV resolution, as according to the hypothesis, only regulatory antigens would trigger a fast and continuous clearance of the viral load. Other hypotheses showed a lower degree of empirical support, but could potentially explain the clearing mechanisms of individual patients. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the dynamics, including the delay between immune response against structural versus regulatory antigens, and its relevance for BKV clearance. Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8poCgXZvMAQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1525986000000</published><fingerprint>fcf2691b</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005998</link><title>Differential T cell response against BK virus regulatory and structural antigens: A viral dynamics modelling approach</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arturo Blazquez-Navarro, Thomas Schachtner, Ulrik Stervbo, Anett Sefrin, Maik Stein, Timm H.

Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8poCgXZvMAQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><author><name>Arturo Blazquez-Navarro</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005998</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/8poCgXZvMAQ/article</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1525984928890</recrawled></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1528179501039</crawled><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_163ce98a7ef:529af15:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0056-0</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Therapeutic and protective efficacy of a dengue antibody against Zika infection in rhesus monkeys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic and protective efficacy of a dengue antibody against Zika infection in rhesus monkeys, Published online: 04 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0056-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0056-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A single monoclonal antibody is therapeutic and has prophylactic activity against Zika virus in monkeys.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/wS47ySfQhB0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1528095600000</published><fingerprint>de845da3</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0056-0</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Therapeutic and protective efficacy of a dengue antibody against Zika infection in rhesus monkeys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic and protective efficacy of a dengue antibody against Zika infection in rhesus monkeys, Published online: 04 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0056-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0056-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A single monoclonal antibody is therapeutic and has prophylactic activity against Zika virus in monkeys.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/wS47ySfQhB0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Therapeutic and protective efficacy of a dengue antibody against Zika infection in rhesus monkeys</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0056-0/MediaObjects/41591_2018_56_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>542</width><height>685</height></visual><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Peter Abbink</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0056-0</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/wS47ySfQhB0/s41591-018-0056-0</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd77:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197823</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin N.

Recent reports have revealed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to arise from cancer stem cells phenotypically similar to physiological hematopoietic stem cells. Myelodysplastic hematopoiesis maintains a hierarchical organization, but the proportion of several hematopoietic compartments is skewed and multiple surface markers are aberrantly expressed. These aberrant antigen expression patterns hold diagnostic and therapeutic promise. However, eradication of MDS requires targeting of early myelodysplasia propagating stem cells. This warrants an exact assessment of the differentiation stage at which aberrant expression occurs in transformed hematopoiesis. Here, we report results on the prospective and extensive dissection of the hematopoietic hierarchy in 20 patients with either low-risk MDS or MDS with excess blasts and compare it to hematopoiesis in patients with non-malignancy-associated cytopenia or B cell lymphoma without bone marrow infiltration. We found patients with MDS with excess blasts to exhibit characteristic expansions of specific immature progenitor compartments. We also identified the aberrant expression of several markers including ALDH, CLL-1, CD44, and CD47 to be specific features of hematopoiesis in MDS with excess blasts. We show that amongst these, aberrant CLL-1 expression manifested at the early uncommitted hematopoietic stem cell level, suggesting a potential role as a therapeutic target.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197823</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Phenotypic characterization of aberrant stem and progenitor cell populations in myelodysplastic syndromes</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin N.

Background &lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). The exact influence of ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFL thickness (RNFLT) is unknown and was analysed in a subgroup of the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Global peripapillary RNFLT was measured in 3224 eyes of 1973 subjects (49% female) using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The association of age, sex, ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFLT was analysed using Pearson correlation coefficient and fitting a linear mixed model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the univariable analysis highest correlations were found for axial length (r = -0.27), spherical equivalent (r = 0.24), and glaucoma (r = -0.15) (p&amp;lt;0.0001, respectively). Other significant correlations with RNFLT were found for age, sex, intraocular pressure, systemic hypertension and systolic blood pressure, previous eye surgery, cholesterol, homocysteine, history of coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, apnoea, diabetes and alcohol intake, p&amp;lt;0.05, respectively. Body length, body weight, BMI, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1c, history of apoplexy, cognitive function, peripheral artery disease, tinnitus, migraine, nicotine intake, central corneal thickness, and pseudophakia were not significantly correlated with RNFLT. The regression model revealed a significant relationship between RNFLT and age in decades (p&amp;lt;0.02), spherical equivalent (p&amp;lt;0.0001), axial length (p&amp;lt;0.0001), glaucoma (p&amp;lt;0.0001), tinnitus (p = 0.04), apnoea (p = 0.047), homocysteine (p = 0.05) and alcohol intake &gt;10g/d for women and &gt;20g/d for men (p = 0.02). Glaucoma, apnoea, higher homocysteine, higher alcohol intake and higher axial length as well as age were related to decreased RNFLT while higher spherical equivalent or history for tinnitus were related to thicker RNFL.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;RNFLT is related to age, ocular parameters and lifestyle factors. Considering these parameters in normative databases could improve the evaluation of peripapillary RNFLT. It is necessary to evaluate if a reduction of alcohol intake as well as the therapy of apnea or high homocysteine levels could positively influence RNFLT.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197682</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Association of ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric and lifestyle parameters with retinal nerve fibre layer thickness</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Julia Lamparter, Irene Schmidtmann, Alexander K.

Background &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) had been reported to be rare. However, recent studies using echocardiography as a screening method showed conflicting results, and the true prevalence is still unclear. Since diagnosing primary SS is difficult because of its heterogeneous nature, a number of patients with primary-SS-associated PAH may be misdiagnosed with idiopathic PAH, losing their chance to undergo immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prevalence of primary SS among patients who initially present with PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From our prospective institutional PAH database, 40 consecutive patients without any obvious cause of PAH at the time of PAH diagnosis were identified. We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of primary SS diagnosed during or after the initial assessment of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the initial assessment, one patient was diagnosed with primary-SS-associated PAH. Among the 25 patients who were initially diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, five were diagnosed with primary SS during their course of the disease. Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation. The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH. Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH.

Perinatal depression is common, and left untreated can have significant and long-lasting consequences for women, their children and their families. Migrant women are at particular risk of perinatal depression as a result of a multitude of stressors experienced before, during and after migration. Identification of perinatal depression among migrant women—particularly those living in low- and middle-income regions—remains challenging, partly due to the lack of locally-validated and culturally appropriate screens tools. This study formally validates Burmese and Sgaw Karen versions of the &lt;i&gt;Refugee Health Screener-15&lt;/i&gt; (RHS-15) as a screening tool for perinatal depression among migrant women living on the Thai-Myanmar border. The &lt;i&gt;Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnosis of DSM-IV Disorders&lt;/i&gt; (SCID) was used as the gold-standard comparator. Complete results were obtained for 235 Burmese-speaking and 275 Sgaw Karen-speaking women. Despite displaying reasonable psychometric properties, a number of shortcomings associated with the RHS-15 limited its utility in this setting. The Likert-type response categories of the RHS-15 proved problematic in this low-literacy population. Combined with the relative superiority and greater ease of administration of the SCID, the RHS-15 is not recommended as the tool of choice for detecting perinatal depression in this setting.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197403</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Validation of the Refugee Health Screener-15 for the assessment of perinatal depression among Karen and Burmese women on the Thai-Myanmar border</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gracia Fellmeth, Emma Plugge, Mina Fazel, Prakaykaew Charunwattana, François Nosten, Raymond Fitzpatrick, Julie A.

A new set of efficient solvent-free dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) force fields was developed for phospholipids and peptides. To enhance transferability, this model maps around four heavy atoms and their connected hydrogen atoms into a coarse-grained elementary bead based on functional group. The effective hybrid potential between any pair of beads is composed of a short-range repulsive soft-core potential that directly adopts the form of an explicit-solvent DPD model and a long-range attractive hydrophobic potential. The parameters of the attractive potentials for lipid molecules were obtained by fitting the explicit-solvent DPD simulation of one bead of any type in a water box, then finely tuning it until the bilayer membrane properties obtained in the explicit-solvent model were matched. These parameters were further extended to amino acids according to bead type. The structural and elastic properties of bilayer membranes, free energy profiles for a lipid flip-flop and amino acid analogues translocating across the membrane, and membrane pore formation induced by antimicrobial peptides obtained from this solvent-free DPD force field considerably agreed with the explicit-solvent DPD results. Importantly, the efficiency of this method is guaranteed to accelerate the assembly of vesicles composed of several thousand lipids by up to 50-fold, rendering the experimental liposome dynamics as well as membrane-peptide interactions feasible at accessible computational expense.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198049</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Implicit-solvent dissipative particle dynamics force field based on a four-to-one coarse-grained mapping scheme</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mingwei Wan, Lianghui Gao, Weihai Fang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to considerable concerns about the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR). Sexual contact, particularly men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most prevalent form of HIV transmission in Shijiazhuang. Hence, we conducted an epidemiological surveillance study on TDR among newly diagnosed individuals who infected-HIV through sexual contact in from 2014–2015.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Genotypic resistance mutations were defined using the WHO-2009 surveillance list. Potential impact on antiretroviral drug was predicted according to the Stanford HIV db program version 7.0. The role of transmission clusters in drug resistant strains was evaluated by phylogenetic and network analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In this study, 589 individuals were recruited and 542 samples were amplified and sequenced successfully. The over prevalence of TDR was 6.1%: 1.8% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 2.0% to non- NRTIs (NNRTIs) and 2.4% to protease inhibitors (PIs), respectively. We did not find significant differences in the TDR prevalence by demographic and clinical characteristics (p &gt; 0.05). Using network and phylogenetic analysis, almost 60.0% sequences were clustered together. Of these clusters, 2 included at least two individuals carrying the same resistance mutation, accounting for 21.2% (7/33) individuals with TDR. No significant difference was observed in the clustering rate between the individuals with and without TDR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We obtained a moderate level TDR rate in studied region. These findings enhance our understanding of HIV-1 drug resistance prevalence in Shijiazhuang, and may be helpful for the comprehensive prevention and control of HIV-1.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Epidemiological surveillance of HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance among newly diagnosed individuals in Shijiazhuang, northern China, 2014–2015</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xianfeng Wang, Xiaosong Liu, Feng Li, Hong Zhou, Jiefang Li, Yingying Wang, Lihua Liu, Shujun Liu, Yi Feng, Ning Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Interleukin 17 (IL-17)–producing γδ T cells (γδ17 T cells) have been recently found to promote tumor growth and metastasis formation. How such γδ17 T-cell responses may be regulated in the tumor microenvironment remains, however, largely unknown. Here, we report that tumor-associated neutrophils can display an overt antitumor role by strongly suppressing γδ17 T cells. Tumor-associated neutrophils inhibited the proliferation of murine CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells via induction of oxidative stress, thereby preventing them from constituting the major source of pro-tumoral IL-17 in the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we found that low expression of the antioxidant glutathione in CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells renders them particularly susceptible to neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistently, superoxide deficiency, or the administration of a glutathione precursor, rescued CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T-cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, human Vδ1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ T cells, which contain most γδ17 T cells found in cancer patients, also displayed low glutathione levels and were potently inhibited by ROS. This work thus identifies an unanticipated, immunosuppressive yet antitumoral, neutrophil/ROS/γδ17 T-cell axis in the tumor microenvironment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dvsUoCba6KA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526072400000</published><fingerprint>d05a552a</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004990</link><title>Tumor-associated neutrophils suppress pro-tumoral IL-17+ γδ T cells through induction of oxidative stress</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Mensurado, Margarida Rei, Telma Lança, Marianna Ioannou, Natacha Gonçalves-Sousa, Hiroshi Kubo, Marie Malissen, Venizelos Papayannopoulos, Karine Serre, Bruno Silva-Santos&lt;/p&gt;

Most annotations of PPIs mix experimental and computational data. The mix optimizes coverage, but obfuscates the annotation origin. Some resources excel at focusing on reliable experimental data. Here, we focused on new pairs of interacting proteins for several model organisms based solely on sequence-based prediction methods. Results: We extracted reliable experimental data about which proteins interact (binary) for eight diverse model organisms from public databases, namely from Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and for the previously used Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Those data were the base to develop a PPI prediction method for each model organism. The method used evolutionary information through a profile-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). With the resulting eight models, we predicted all possible protein pairs in each organism and made the top predictions available through a web application. Almost all of the PPIs made available were predicted between proteins that have not been observed in any interaction, in particular for less well-studied organisms. Thus, our work complements existing resources and is particularly helpful for designing experiments because of its uniqueness. Experimental annotations and computational predictions are strongly influenced by the fact that some proteins have many partners and others few. To optimize machine learning, the newly methods explicitly ignored such a network-structure and rely either on domain knowledge or sequence-only methods. Our approach is independent of domain-knowledge and leverages evolutionary information.

One key step in this quality control is assessment of DNA damage: aDNA contains unique signatures of DNA damage that distinguish it from modern DNA, and so analyses of damage patterns can help confirm that DNA sequences obtained are from endogenous aDNA rather than from modern contamination. Predominant signatures of DNA damage include a high frequency of cytosine to thymine substitutions (C-to-T) at the ends of fragments, and elevated rates of purines (A &amp;amp; G) before the 5&apos; strand-breaks. Existing QC procedures help assess damage by simply plotting for each sample, the C-to-T mismatch rate along the read and the composition of bases before the 5&apos; strand-breaks. Here we present a more flexible and comprehensive model-based approach to infer and visualize damage patterns in aDNA, implemented in an R package aRchaic. This approach is based on a &amp;quot;grade of membership&amp;quot; model (also known as &amp;quot;admixture&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; model) in which each sample has an estimated grade of membership in each of K damage profiles that are estimated from the data. We illustrate aRchaic on data from several aDNA studies and modern individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. Here, aRchaic clearly distinguishes modern from ancient samples irrespective of DNA extraction, lab and sequencing protocols. Additionally, through an in-silico contamination experiment, we show that the aRchaic grades of membership reflect relative levels of exogenous modern contamination. Together, the outputs of aRchaic provide a concise visual summary of DNA damage patterns, as well as other processes generating mismatches in the data.</description><published>1526886000000</published><fingerprint>e498ce96</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327684v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Quality control plays a major role in the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA).

Together, the outputs of aRchaic provide a concise visual summary of DNA damage patterns, as well as other processes generating mismatches in the data.</content></content><title>Inference and visualization of DNA damage patterns using a grade of membership model [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Al-Asadi, H.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/21/327684</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327684v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915f:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197309</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Róbert Adrian Rill, Kinga Bettina Faragó, András Lőrincz&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197309</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: Strategic predictors of performance in a divided attention task</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Róbert Adrian Rill, Kinga Bettina Faragó, András Lőrincz&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Róbert Adrian Rill</name></author><fingerprint>3727df65</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197309</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197309</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526980668897</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1638723ede1:6bed1e2:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks, Published online: 22 May 2018;

Sleep science is entering a new era, thanks to new data-driven analysis approaches that, combined with mouse gene–editing technologies, show a promise in functional genomics and translational research. However, the investigation of sleep is time consuming and not suitable for large-scale phenotypic datasets, mainly due to the need for subjective manual annotations of electrophysiological states. Moreover, the heterogeneous nature of sleep, with all its physiological aspects, is not fully accounted for by the current system of sleep stage classification. In this study, we present a new data-driven analysis approach offering a plethora of novel features for the characterization of sleep. This novel approach allowed for identifying several substages of sleep that were hidden to standard analysis. For each of these substages, we report an independent set of homeostatic responses following sleep deprivation. By using our new substages classification, we have identified novel differences among various genetic backgrounds. Moreover, in a specific experiment with the &lt;i&gt;Zfhx3&lt;/i&gt; mouse line, a recent circadian mutant expressing both shortening of the circadian period and abnormal sleep architecture, we identified specific sleep states that account for genotypic differences at specific times of the day. These results add a further level of interaction between circadian clock and sleep homeostasis and indicate that dissecting sleep in multiple states is physiologically relevant and can lead to the discovery of new links between sleep phenotypes and genetic determinants. Therefore, our approach has the potential to significantly enhance the understanding of sleep physiology through the study of single mutations. Moreover, this study paves the way to systematic high-throughput analyses of sleep.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bBGe8ybdGnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><fingerprint>284d5a5d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003663</link><title>A novel unsupervised analysis of electrophysiological signals reveals new sleep substages in mice</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vasiliki-Maria Katsageorgiou, Diego Sona, Matteo Zanotto, Glenda Lassi, Celina Garcia-Garcia, Valter Tucci, Vittorio Murino&lt;/p&gt;

The energy-growth nexus has important policy implications for economic development. The results from many past studies that investigated the causality direction of this nexus can lead to misleading policy guidance. Using data on China from 1953 to 2013, this study shows that an application of causality test on the time series of energy consumption and national output has masked a lot of information. The Toda-Yamamoto test with bootstrapped critical values and the newly proposed non-linear causality test reveal no causal relationship. However, a further application of these tests using series in different time-frequency domain obtained from wavelet decomposition indicates that while energy consumption Granger causes economic growth in the short run, the reverse is true in the medium term. A bidirectional causal relationship is found for the long run. This approach has proven to be superior in unveiling information on the energy-growth nexus that are useful for policy planning over different time horizons.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197785</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Linear and nonlinear causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in China: New evidence based on wavelet analysis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Junsheng Ha, Pei-Pei Tan, Kim-Leng Goh&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Achieving proper rotational alignment of the femoral component in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for valgus knee is challenging because of lateral condylar hypoplasia and lateral cartilage erosion. Gap-based navigation-assisted TKA enables surgeons to determine the angle of femoral component rotation (FCR) based on the posterior condylar axis. This study evaluated the possible factors that affect the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Between 2008 and 2016, 28 knees were enrolled. The dependent variable for this study was FCR based on the posterior condylar axis, which was obtained from the navigation system archives. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might predict FCR, including body mass index (BMI), Kellgren-Lawrence grade (K-L grade), lateral distal femoral angles obtained from the navigation system and radiographs (NaviLDFA, XrayLDFA), hip-knee-ankle (HKA) axis, lateral gap under varus stress (LGVS), medial gap under valgus stress (MGVS), and side-to-side difference (STSD, MGVS − LGVS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean FCR was 6.1° ± 2.0°. Of all the potentially predictive factors evaluated in this study, only NaviLDFA (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = −0.668) and XrayLDFA (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = −0.714) predicted significantly FCR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The LDFAs, as determined using radiographs and the navigation system, were both predictive of the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis in gap-based TKA for valgus knee. A 1° increment with NaviLDFA led to a 0.668° decrement in FCR, and a 1° increment with XrayLDFA led to a 0.714° decrement. This suggests that symmetrical lateral condylar hypoplasia of the posterior and distal side occurs in lateral compartment end-stage osteoarthritis with valgus deformity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197335</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Factors affecting femoral rotational angle based on the posterior condylar axis in gap-based navigation-assisted total knee arthroplasty for valgus knee</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sung-Sahn Lee, Yong-In Lee, Dong-Uk Kim, Dae-Hee Lee, Young-Wan Moon&lt;/p&gt;

Human tyrosinase (hTyr) is a Type 1 membrane bound glycoenzyme that catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting steps of melanin production in the melanosome. Mutations in the &lt;i&gt;Tyr&lt;/i&gt; gene are linked to oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), an autosomal recessive disorder. Currently, the application of enzyme replacement therapy for a treatment of OCA1 is hampered by the absence of pure hTyr. Here, full-length hTyr (residues 1–529) was overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Trichoplusia ni&lt;/i&gt; larvae infected with a baculovirus, solubilized with detergent and purified using chromatography. Michaelis-Menten kinetics, enzymatic specific activity, and analytical ultracentrifugation were used to compare the hTyr in detergent with the soluble recombinant intra-melanosomal domain, hTyrC&lt;sub&gt;tr&lt;/sub&gt; (residues 19–469). Active hTyr is monomeric in detergent micelles suggesting no stable interactions between protein molecules. Both, hTyr and hTyrC&lt;sub&gt;tr&lt;/sub&gt;, exhibited similar enzymatic activity and ligand affinity in L-DOPA and L-Tyrosine reactions. In addition, expression in larvae is a scalable process that will allow high yield protein production. Thus, larval production of enzymatically active human tyrosinase potentially could be a useful tool in developing a cure for OCA1.</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Membrane-associated human tyrosinase is an enzymatically active monomeric glycoprotein</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicole J.

This paper is concerned with the potential multistability of protein concentrations in the cell. That is, situations where one, or a family of, proteins may sit at one of two or more different steady state concentrations in otherwise identical cells, and in spite of them being in the same environment. For models of multisite protein phosphorylation for example, in the presence of excess substrate, it has been shown that the achievable number of stable steady states can increase linearly with the number of phosphosites available. In this paper, we analyse the consequences of adding enzyme docking to these and similar models, with the resultant sequestration of phosphatase and kinase by the fully unphosphorylated and by the fully phosphorylated substrates respectively. In the large molecule numbers limit, where deterministic analysis is applicable, we prove that there are always values for these rates of sequestration which, when exceeded, limit the extent of multistability. For the models considered here, these numbers are much smaller than the affinity of the enzymes to the substrate when it is in a modifiable state. As substrate enzyme-sequestration is increased, we further prove that the number of steady states will inevitably be reduced to one. For smaller molecule numbers a stochastic analysis is more appropriate, where multistability in the large molecule numbers limit can manifest itself as multimodality of the probability distribution; the system spending periods of time in the vicinity of one mode before jumping to another. Here, we find that substrate enzyme sequestration can induce bimodality even in systems where only a single steady state can exist at large numbers. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a weakly chained diagonally dominant M-matrix formulation of the Chemical Master Equation, allowing greater insights in the way particular mechanisms, like enzyme sequestration, can shape probability distributions and therefore exhibit different behaviour across different regimes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2a3YD9EnPsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526590800000</published><fingerprint>f2cc0daa</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006107</link><title>Enzyme sequestration by the substrate: An analysis in the deterministic and stochastic domains</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Petrides, Glenn Vinnicombe&lt;/p&gt;

White adipose tissue expands through both adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia and it is hypothesized that fibrosis or excess accumulation of extracellular matrix within adipose tissue may limit tissue expansion contributing to metabolic dysfunction. The pathways that control adipose tissue remodeling are only partially understood, however it is likely that adipose tissue stromal and perivascular progenitors participate in fibrotic remodeling and also serve as adipocyte progenitors. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of the secreted extracellular matrix protein aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP) on adipose progenitor differentiation in the context of adipose tissue fibrosis. Treatment of 10T1/2 mouse cells with recombinant ACLP suppressed adipogenesis and enhanced myofibroblast differentiation, which was dependent on transforming growth factor-β receptor kinase activity. Mice fed a chronic high fat diet exhibited white adipose tissue fibrosis with elevated ACLP expression and cellular fractionation of these depots revealed that ACLP was co-expressed with collagens primarily in the inflammatory cell depleted stromal-vascular fraction (SVF). SVF cells isolated from mice fed a high fat diet secreted increased amounts of ACLP compared to low fat diet control SVF. These cells also exhibited reduced adipogenic differentiation capacity in vitro. Importantly, differentiation studies in primary human adipose stromal cells revealed that mature adipocytes do not express ACLP and exogenous ACLP administration blunted their differentiation potential while upregulating myofibroblastic markers. Collectively, these studies identify ACLP as a stromal derived mediator of adipose progenitor differentiation that may limit adipocyte expansion during white adipose tissue fibrosis.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197777</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein enhances adipose tissue stromal progenitor differentiation into myofibroblasts and is upregulated in fibrotic white adipose tissue</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mike Jager, Mi-Jeong Lee, Chendi Li, Stephen R.

HIV acquisition during pregnancy and breastfeeding significantly contributes toward paediatric HIV infection; however, little is known about risk behaviours in HIV-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted twenty-six in-depth-interviews between July and December 2016 using a semi-structured interview guide among HIV-uninfected pregnant and recently postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition (defined as reporting ≥1 of the following: partner’s serostatus unknown or HIV-infected, recent condomless sex in pregnancy, and/or alcohol use during pregnancy) who attended primary healthcare services. Our study contextualizes factors related to risky sexual behaviours during pregnancy and postpartum periods and assesses knowledge and hypothetical acceptability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnancy. Translated and transcribed data were coded and analysed by three researchers using a thematic analysis approach. In interviews with HIV-uninfected pregnant/postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition, we identified common themes associated with sexual risk behaviours during pregnancy, including: lack of control over decisions in sex and condom use in pregnancy, low perceived risk (e.g. beliefs that their partner has the same HIV-negative serostatus), and socio-cultural beliefs around condom use during pregnancy (e.g. contact with sperm is essential for baby’s development). PrEP knowledge was low among HIV-uninfected pregnant and breastfeeding women, and potential acceptability was good, though primary concerns were around the potential impact on the infant. While mothers presented a clear desire to protect themselves from HIV acquisition once pregnant, they also reported lack of control, and socio-cultural beliefs, like sex is good for the baby, that increased their risk of seroconversion. Mothers had limited PrEP awareness but reported hypothetical willingness to use PrEP because of concerns over HIV acquisition and onward mother to child transmission.</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197143</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Risk perception and sex behaviour in pregnancy and breastfeeding in high HIV prevalence settings: Programmatic implications for PrEP delivery</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dvora Joseph Davey, Elise Farley, Catriona Towriss, Yolanda Gomba, Linda-Gail Bekker, Pamina Gorbach, Steven Shoptaw, Thomas Coates, Landon Myer&lt;/p&gt;

Genus &lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus&lt;/i&gt; has a wide distribution in North Africa and in the Middle East. In the present study, we modeled the habitat suitability of two Omani species of the genus (&lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt;) to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on their distribution. Mean diurnal range and precipitation of wettest quarter are the most highly contributed variables for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The potential distribution for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt; in the current time covers the southern coastal regions of Oman, Yemen, the Horn of Africa, and Socotra Island, but the suitable regions were reduced in the future prediction and limited to Yemen, Socotra Island, and Oman. There have not been any records of the species outside of Oman. Analysis of habitat suitability for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt; indicated that the species is restricted to the Al Hajar Mountain of Oman and the southeast coastal region of Iran, but there are no records of the species from Iran. Because mean diurnal range will not be influenced by climate change in future, the potential distribution of the species is not expected to be changed in 2050. All predicted models were performed with the highest AUC (more than 0.97) using the Maxent method. Investigation to find unknown populations of these two species in Iran, Yemen, and Socotra Island is essential for developing conservation programs in the future.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197884</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Effects of climate change on niche shifts of &amp;lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus dhofarensis&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus jensvindumi&amp;lt;/i&gt; (Reptilia: Agamidae) in Western Asia</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Iman Rounaghi, Seyyed Saeed Hosseinian Yousefkhani&lt;/p&gt;

Mean diurnal range and precipitation of wettest quarter are the most highly contributed variables for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The potential distribution for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt; in the current time covers the southern coastal regions of Oman, Yemen, the Horn of Africa, and Socotra Island, but the suitable regions were reduced in the future prediction and limited to Yemen, Socotra Island, and Oman. There have not been any records of the species outside of Oman. Analysis of habitat suitability for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt; indicated that the species is restricted to the Al Hajar Mountain of Oman and the southeast coastal region of Iran, but there are no records of the species from Iran. Because mean diurnal range will not be influenced by climate change in future, the potential distribution of the species is not expected to be changed in 2050. All predicted models were performed with the highest AUC (more than 0.97) using the Maxent method. Investigation to find unknown populations of these two species in Iran, Yemen, and Socotra Island is essential for developing conservation programs in the future.</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Iman Rounaghi</name></author><fingerprint>1543c774</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197884</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197884</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>93</engagement><crawled>1525801790399</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16340dfabbf:493f3a:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05126-9</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to tell how much wasp stings will hurt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to tell how much wasp stings will hurt, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05126-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05126-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Short stinging organs tend to carry more-toxic venom — but inflict less pain — than long ones.</description><published>1525762800000</published><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05126-9</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to tell how much wasp stings will hurt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to tell how much wasp stings will hurt, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05126-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05126-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Short stinging organs tend to carry more-toxic venom — but inflict less pain — than long ones.</content></content><title>How to tell how much wasp stings will hurt</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05126-9/d41586-018-05126-9_15744626.jpg</url><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><fingerprint>97c95447</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05126-9</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721a:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196887</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by David D.

Intermittent water supplies (IWS) deliver piped water to one billion people; this water is often microbially contaminated. Contaminants that accumulate while IWS are depressurized are flushed into customers’ homes when these systems become pressurized. In addition, during the steady-state phase of IWS, contaminants from higher-pressure sources (e.g., sewers) may continue to intrude where pipe pressure is low. To guide the operation and improvement of IWS, this paper proposes an analytic model relating supply pressure, supply duration, leakage, and the volume of intruded, potentially-contaminated, fluids present during flushing and steady-state. The proposed model suggests that increasing the supply duration may improve water quality during the flushing phase, but decrease the subsequent steady-state water quality. As such, regulators and academics should take more care in reporting if water quality samples are taken during flushing or steady-state operational conditions. Pipe leakage increases with increased supply pressure and/or duration. We propose using an equivalent orifice area (EOA) to quantify pipe quality. This provides a more stable metric for regulators and utilities tracking pipe repairs. Finally, we show that the volume of intruded fluid decreases in proportion to reductions in EOA. The proposed relationships are applied to self-reported performance indicators for IWS serving 108 million people described in the IBNET database and in the Benchmarking and Data Book of Water Utilities in India. This application shows that current high-pressure, continuous water supply targets will require extensive EOA reductions. For example, in order to achieve national targets, utilities in India will need to reduce their EOA by a median of at least 90%.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196887</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Analytical scaling relations to evaluate leakage and intrusion in intermittent water supply systems</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by David D.

Xi-MPS always delivered the highest number of identifications with ~2 to 4-fold increase of PSMs without compromising identification accuracy as determined by FDR estimation and comparison to crystallographic models.</content></content><title>In-Search Selection of Monoisotopic Peaks Improves the Identification of Cross-Linked Peptides [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Lenz, S.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/31/335851</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335851v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1526981725661</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16387340ddd:6c08798:93d646dc</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5031761?af=R</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526874124000</published><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5031761?af=R</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/19&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 19&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Nonequilibrium thermodynamics and boundary conditions for reaction and transport in heterogeneous media</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Pierre Gaspard</name></author><fingerprint>8c279f4d</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5031761?af=R</href></item></alternate></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1527492817805</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163a5aab38d:1587659:3dd877af</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025348?af=R</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527140109000</published><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025348?af=R</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/20&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 20&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Two-stage DNA compaction induced by silver ions suggests a cooperative binding mechanism</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Wen-Yan Jiang</name></author><fingerprint>87e13a9b</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025348?af=R</href></item></alternate></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Presented is the implementation of the Drude force field in the open‐source OpenMM simulation package allowing for access to graphical processing unit (GPU) hardware.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, almost exclusively female lung disease linked to inactivating mutations in &lt;i&gt;tuberous sclerosis complex 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TSC2)&lt;/i&gt;, a tumor suppressor gene that controls cell metabolic state and growth via regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) signaling. mTORC1 is frequently activated in human cancers and, although the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has a cytostatic effect, it is, in general, unable to elicit a robust curative effect or tumor regression. Using RNA-Seq, we identified (1) &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like Growth Factor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt;) as one of the genes with the highest fold-change difference between human &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-null and &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-expressing angiomyolipoma cells from a patient with LAM, and (2) the mouse &lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt; homolog &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt;, as a top-ranking gene according to fold change between &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We extended transcript-level findings to protein level, observing increased Igf2 protein expression and Igf2 secretion by &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. Increased Igf2 expression was not due to epigenetic imprinting, but was partially mediated through the Stat3 pathway and was completely insensitive to rapamycin treatment. An siRNA-mediated decrease of Igf2 resulted in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation, suggesting presence of an autocrine Igf2/Stat3 amplification cycle in &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. In human pulmonary LAM lesions and metastatic cell clusters, high levels of IGF2 were associated with mTORC1 activation. In addition, treatment of three primary IGF2-expressing LAM lung cell lines with rapamycin did not result in IGF2 level changes. Thus, targeting of IGF2 signaling may be of therapeutic value to LAM patients, particularly those who are unresponsive to rapamycin.</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197105</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Rapamycin-independent &amp;lt;i&gt;IGF2&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression in &amp;lt;i&gt;Tsc2&amp;lt;/i&gt;-null mouse embryo fibroblasts and human lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Blanca E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Creatine kinase (CK) has been associated with reduced inflammation in obesity while inflammation is associated with obesity-related cardiovascular diseases.

Functional imaging studies of affective disorders have demonstrated abnormal activity in the amygdala in response to emotionally salient stimuli. Since in other studies this response has been shown to habituate during the scanning session, it is not clear if it may be of use in monitoring disease progression or remission, or in monitoring the effects of therapy, as habituation may confound normalisation of response. We investigated here amygdala activation in healthy participants exposed to displays of emotional facial expressions in a sample of N = 31 individuals assessed twice in an interval of three weeks. At this interval no habituation could be detected, suggesting the validity of this imaging assay in repeated assessments of amygdalar reactivity. However, the fusiform gyrus and the inferior frontal lobes showed decreases in activations that may be related to the role of these areas in encoding visual and emotional aspects of the stimuli.</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198244</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Repeated fMRI in measuring the activation of the amygdala without habituation when viewing faces displaying negative emotions</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Spohrs, Julia E.

Overconfidence has been reported to be a common bias among entrepreneurs and might be one cause of the high failure rates observed for new ventures. In this study, we investigate the overconfidence bias in a sample of 92 Austrian entrepreneurs, who responded to a general-knowledge questionnaire. Their levels of overconfidence were assessed by their responses to hard, medium and easy knowledge questions, and the relations of individual, organizational and environmental factors to the bias score were analyzed. The results confirmed that entrepreneurs are indeed prone to expressing overprecision, a type of overconfidence, but not when answering questions of all levels of difficulty. Being a single founder instead of a co-founder was identified as a significant predictor of overconfidence.

Overconfidence has been reported to be a common bias among entrepreneurs and might be one cause of the high failure rates observed for new ventures. In this study, we investigate the overconfidence bias in a sample of 92 Austrian entrepreneurs, who responded to a general-knowledge questionnaire. Their levels of overconfidence were assessed by their responses to hard, medium and easy knowledge questions, and the relations of individual, organizational and environmental factors to the bias score were analyzed. The results confirmed that entrepreneurs are indeed prone to expressing overprecision, a type of overconfidence, but not when answering questions of all levels of difficulty. Being a single founder instead of a co-founder was identified as a significant predictor of overconfidence. Confidence, on the other hand, was associated with age and prior entrepreneurial experience, while accuracy was determined solely by age. The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Viktorija Ilieva</name></author><fingerprint>47e98465</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6b:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196914</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Shepherd, Geoff K.

The evidence base is diverse, investigating many aspects of the systems for, and processes of, peer review. The systematic review included eight studies from Australia, Canada, and the USA, evaluating a broad range of peer review innovations. These studies showed that simplifying the process by shortening proposal forms, using smaller reviewer panels, or expediting processes can speed up the review process and reduce costs, but this might come at the expense of peer review quality, a key aspect that has not been assessed.

In cases of impending natural disasters, most events are uncertain and emotionally relevant, both critical factors for decision-making. Moreover, for exposed individuals, the sensitivity to the framing of the consequences (gain or loss) and the moral judgments they have to perform (e.g., evacuate or help an injured person) constitute two central effects that have never been examined in the same context of decision-making. In a framed decision-making task with moral dilemma, we investigated whether uncertainty (i.e., unpredictably of events) and a threatening context would influence the framing effect (actions framed in loss are avoided in comparison to the ones framed in gain) and the personal intention effect (unintentional actions are more morally acceptable in comparison to intentional actions) on the perceived moral acceptability of taking action. Considering the impact of uncertainty and fear on the processes underlying these effects, we assumed that these emotions would lead to the negation of the two effects. Our results indicate that the exposure to uncertain events leads to the negation of the framing effect, but does not influence the moral acceptability and the effect of personal intention. We discuss our results in the light of dual-process models (i.e. systematic &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. heuristic), appraisal theories, and neurocognitive aspects. These elements highlight the importance of providing solutions to cope with uncertainty, both for scientists and local populations exposed to natural hazards.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197923</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Influence of uncertainty on framed decision-making with moral dilemma</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gaëtan Merlhiot, Martial Mermillod, Jean-Luc Le Pennec, Frédéric Dutheil, Laurie Mondillon&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Although many previous studies have examined the determinants of happiness in older adults, few have investigated the association between pension types and happiness. When compared to other conventional socioeconomic indicators, pension types may be more indicative of long-term socioeconomic status as they can reflect a person’s job history over their life course. This study examined the association between pension types and happiness in Japanese older people.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study were used to analyze the association between pension types and happiness. The study population comprised 120152 participants from 2013. We calculated the prevalence ratios of happiness for the different pension types using Poisson regression models that controlled for age, sex, marital status, equivalent income, wealth, education level, working status, occupation, depression, and social support.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After controlling for socioeconomic indicators, the prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of happiness for no pension benefits, low pension benefits, and moderate pension benefits relative to high pension benefits were 0.77 (0.73–0.81), 0.95 (0.94–0.97), and 0.98 (0.97–0.99), respectively. However, the inclusion of depression as a covariate weakened the association between pension types and happiness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While pension types were associated with happiness after adjusting for other proxy measures of socioeconomic status, the association diminished following adjustment for depression. Pension types may provide rich information on socioeconomic status and depression throughout the course of life. In addition to conventional socioeconomic indicators, pension types should also be considered when assessing the determinants of happiness in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197423</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Are pension types associated with happiness in Japanese older people?: JAGES cross-sectional study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ichiro Sasaki, Katsunori Kondo, Naoki Kondo, Jun Aida, Hiroshi Ichikawa, Takashi Kusumi, Naoya Sueishi, Yuichi Imanaka&lt;/p&gt;

Nationwide, 34 million hours of cross-partisan Thanksgiving dinner discourse were lost in 2016 owing to partisan effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagementRate>3.52</engagementRate><title>The effect of partisanship and political advertising on close family ties</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Chen, M.

Huntington’s disease (HD) age of onset (AO) is mainly determined by the length of the CAG repeat expansion in the &lt;i&gt;huntingtin&lt;/i&gt; gene. The remaining AO variability has been attributed to other little-known factors. A factor that has been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases is arterial hypertension (AHT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of AHT to the AO of HD. We used data from a cohort of 630 European HD patients with adult onset collected by the REGISTRY project of the European Huntington’s Disease Network. Multiple linear regression and ANOVA, controlling for the CAG repeat number of the expanded allele (CAGexp) of each patient, were performed to assess the association between the AHT condition and the AO of the motor symptoms (mAO). The results showed a significant association between AHT and mAO, especially when we only considered the patients diagnosed with AHT prior to manifesting any HD signs (pre-HD AHT). Remarkably, despite the low number of cases, those patients developed motor symptoms 5–8 years later than normotensive patients in the most frequent CAGexp range (40–44). AHT is an age-related condition and consequently, the age of the patient at the time of data collection could be a confounder variable. However, given that most pre-HD AHT patients included in our study had started treatment with antihypertensive drugs prior to the onset of HD, and that antihypertensive drugs have been suggested to confer a neuroprotective effect in other neurodegenerative diseases, raises the interest in elucidating the impact of AHT and/or AHT treatment in HD age of onset in further studies. A confirmation of our results in a larger sample set would open the possibility to significantly improve HD management.</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197975</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Does arterial hypertension influence the onset of Huntington&apos;s disease?</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Leire Valcárcel-Ocete, Asier Fullaondo, Gorka Alkorta-Aranburu, María García-Barcina, Raymund A.

Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-protein complexes in a number of bacterial pathogens that can translocate proteins and DNA to the host. Most T4SSs function in conjugation and translocate DNA; however, approximately 13% function to secrete proteins, delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. Upon entry, these effectors manipulate the host cell’s machinery for their own benefit, which can result in serious illness or death of the host. For this reason recognition of T4SS effectors has become an important subject. Much previous work has focused on verifying effectors experimentally, a costly endeavor in terms of money, time, and effort. Having good predictions for effectors will help to focus experimental validations and decrease testing costs. In recent years, several scoring and machine learning-based methods have been suggested for the purpose of predicting T4SS effector proteins. These methods have used different sets of features for prediction, and their predictions have been inconsistent. In this paper, an optimal set of features is presented for predicting T4SS effector proteins using a statistical approach. A thorough literature search was performed to find features that have been proposed. Feature values were calculated for datasets of known effectors and non-effectors for T4SS-containing pathogens for four genera with a sufficient number of known effectors, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp, and &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. The features were ranked, and less important features were filtered out.

Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-protein complexes in a number of bacterial pathogens that can translocate proteins and DNA to the host. Most T4SSs function in conjugation and translocate DNA; however, approximately 13% function to secrete proteins, delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. Upon entry, these effectors manipulate the host cell’s machinery for their own benefit, which can result in serious illness or death of the host. For this reason recognition of T4SS effectors has become an important subject. Much previous work has focused on verifying effectors experimentally, a costly endeavor in terms of money, time, and effort. Having good predictions for effectors will help to focus experimental validations and decrease testing costs. In recent years, several scoring and machine learning-based methods have been suggested for the purpose of predicting T4SS effector proteins. These methods have used different sets of features for prediction, and their predictions have been inconsistent. In this paper, an optimal set of features is presented for predicting T4SS effector proteins using a statistical approach. A thorough literature search was performed to find features that have been proposed. Feature values were calculated for datasets of known effectors and non-effectors for T4SS-containing pathogens for four genera with a sufficient number of known effectors, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp, and &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. The features were ranked, and less important features were filtered out. Correlations between remaining features were removed, and dimensional reduction was accomplished using principal component analysis and factor analysis. Finally, the optimal features for each pathogen were chosen by building logistic regression models and evaluating each model. The results based on evaluation of our logistic regression models confirm the effectiveness of our four optimal sets of features, and based on these an optimal set of features is proposed for all T4SS effector proteins.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Zhila Esna Ashari</name></author><fingerprint>f6131981</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197041</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527009159129</crawled><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16388d6a7d9:6ccef77:3dd877af</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5564.short?rss=1</originId><description>Clumping factor A (ClfA), a cell-wall–anchored protein from Staphylococcus aureus, is a virulence factor in various infections and facilitates the colonization of protein-coated biomaterials.

Background &lt;p&gt;There is evidence that maternal genotypes in folate-related genes are associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) independent of offspring genotype. We evaluated the relationship between maternal genotypes in methionine synthase (&lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;) and DNA methylation status in ALL to better characterize the molecular mechanism underlying this association.&lt;/p&gt; Procedure &lt;p&gt;We obtained bone marrow samples from 51 patients with ALL at diagnosis and from 6 healthy donors. Mothers of patients provided a saliva sample and were genotyped at 11 tagSNPs in &lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;. DNA methylation was measured in bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients and six healthy marrow donors. We used hierarchical clustering to identify patients with a hypermethylator phenotype based on 281 differentially methylated promoter CpGs. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of maternal genotype on the likelihood of DNA hypermethylation in ALL and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify networks enriched for differentially methylated genes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-two cases (43%) demonstrated promoter hypermethylation, which was more frequent among those with &lt;i&gt;ETV6-RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; fusion and initial white blood cell count &amp;lt; 50 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L. Maternal rs12759827 was associated with aberrant DNA methylation (odds ratio [OR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval 1.46–16.31); non-significantly elevated ORs were observed for all other SNPs.

The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.

This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><author><name>Marie Ménard</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002912</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/k59-VYZP8r0/article</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1526060763996</recrawled></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1528220492204</crawled><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_163d10a21ac:5714dfc:2835af05</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5866.short?rss=1</originId><description>Sulfur monoxide (SO) is a highly reactive molecule and thus, eludes bulk isolation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Aspiration of gastric acid is an important cause of acute lung injury. The time course of the pulmonary response to such an insult beyond the initial 48 hours is incompletely characterized. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively describe the pulmonary effects of focal lung acid injury over a seven day period in both directly injured and not directly injured lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Wistar rats underwent left-endobronchial instillation with hydrochloric acid and were sacrificed at 4, 24, 48, 96 or 168 h after the insult. Healthy non-injured animals served as controls. We assessed inflammatory cell counts and cytokine levels in right and left lung lavage fluid and blood, arterial oxygen tension, alterations in lung histology, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio and differential lung perfusion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Lung acid instillation induced an early strong inflammatory response in the directly affected lung, peaking at 4–24 hours, with only partial resolution after 7 days. A less severe response with complete resolution after 4 days was seen in the opposite lung. Alveolar cytokine levels, with exception of IL-6, only partially reflected the localization of lung injury and the time course of the functional and histologic alterations. Alveolar leucocyte subpopulations exhibited different time courses in the acid injured lung with persistent elevation of alveolar lymphocytes and macrophages. After acid instillation there was an early transient decrease in arterial oxygen tension and lung perfusion was preferentially distributed to the non-injured lung.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings provide a basis for further research in the field of lung acid injury and for studies exploring effects of mechanical ventilation on injured lungs. Incomplete recovery in the directly injured lung 7 days after acid instillation suggests that increased vulnerability and susceptibility to further noxious stimuli are still present at that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198440</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Characterization of the seven-day course of pulmonary response following unilateral lung acid injury in rats</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Setzer, Barbara Schmidt, Lars Hueter, Konrad Schwarzkopf, Jörg Sänger, Torsten Schreiber&lt;/p&gt;

The stress-induced mutagenesis hypothesis postulates that in response to stress, bacteria increase their genome-wide mutation rate, in turn increasing the chances that a descendant is able to better withstand the stress. This has implications for antibiotic treatment: exposure to subinhibitory doses of antibiotics has been reported to increase bacterial mutation rates and thus probably the rate at which resistance mutations appear and lead to treatment failure. More generally, the hypothesis posits that stress increases evolvability (the ability of a population to generate adaptive genetic diversity) and thus accelerates evolution. Measuring mutation rates under stress, however, is problematic, because existing methods assume there is no death. Yet subinhibitory stress levels may induce a substantial death rate. Death events need to be compensated by extra replication to reach a given population size, thus providing more opportunities to acquire mutations. We show that ignoring death leads to a systematic overestimation of mutation rates under stress. We developed a system based on plasmid segregation that allows us to measure death and division rates simultaneously in bacterial populations. Using this system, we found that a substantial death rate occurs at the tested subinhibitory concentrations previously reported to increase mutation rate. Taking this death rate into account lowers and sometimes removes the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, even when antibiotics increase mutation rate, we show that subinhibitory treatments do not increase genetic diversity and evolvability, again because of effects of the antibiotics on population dynamics. We conclude that antibiotic-induced mutagenesis is overestimated because of death and that understanding evolvability under stress requires accounting for the effects of stress on population dynamics as much as on mutation rate. Our goal here is dual: we show that population dynamics and, in particular, the numbers of cell divisions are crucial but neglected parameters in the evolvability of a population, and we provide experimental and computational tools and methods to study evolvability under stress, leading to a reassessment of the magnitude and significance of the stress-induced mutagenesis paradigm.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YW43eur48VA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526072400000</published><fingerprint>61ca3542</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005056</link><title>Death and population dynamics affect mutation rate estimates and evolvability under stress in bacteria</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Frenoy, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine the association between preoperational factors and patients’ short-term outcome after proximal fibular osteotomy (PFO) and to provide a basis for detailed surgical indication and patient selection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing PFO between January 2015 and December 2015. Preoperational clinical data including gender, age, duration of disease, visual analogue score (VAS) and American Knee Society (KSS) score were collected. The radiological factors including hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA angle), condyle-plateau angle (CP angle), Kellgren and Lawrence grade (KL grade), joint space width of both compartments and settlement value were also considered. Patients were followed for at 12 months postoperatively. Both clinical and functional KSS scores were obtained. The outcome of interest was divided into clinical outcome and functional outcome. For each, two criteria were defined: satisfaction and significant improvement. Satisfaction is characterized by a KSS clinical or functional score over 70 points (excellent and good results); significant improvement refers to an increase in KSS scores of more than 15 points. Bivariate logistic regression for the association between preoperational factors and outcomes of interest was performed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to detect the independent factors affecting the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 84 patients and 111 knees were followed-up. Of these, 17 knees were from males and 94 were from females. The average age was 59.45±8.82 years. The average preoperational VAS score, KSS clinical and functional score were 7.08±1.41 points, 49.14±10.95 points and 44.97±17.71 points, respectively. According to KL grading, there were 17 knees of grade 2, 47 knees of grade 3, and 47 knees of grade 4. In clinical outcomes, there were 51 knees in the satisfaction group and 77 knees in the significant improvement group. In functional outcomes, 43 knees were in the satisfaction group and 76 knees in the significant improvement group. KSS clinical score (OR = 1.134, 95%CI = 1.067–1.205, P = 0.000) was the independent factor associated with clinical satisfaction. Age (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.000–1.150, P = 0.048), VAS score (OR = 1.679, 95%CI = 1.041–2.706, P = 0.033), KSS clinical (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.005–1.144, P = 0.034) and functional (OR = 1.100, 95%CI = 1.044–1.159, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.345, 95%CI = 1.119–1.617, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 7.540, 95%CI = 1.307–43.484, P = 0.024) were the independent factors associated with functional satisfaction. KSS clinical (OR = 0.905, 95%CI = 0.850–0.963, P = 0.002) score, CP angle (OR = 0.760, 95%CI = 0.593–0.973, P = 0.030) and medial joint space width (OR = 0.001, 95%CI = 0.000–0.107, P = 0.003) were the independent factors associated with significant clinical improvement; VAS score (OR = 1.582, 95%CI = 1.042–2.402, P = 0.031), KSS functional (OR = 0.888, 95%CI = 0.838–0.942, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.292, 95%CI = 1.101–1.518, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 9.990, 95%CI = 1.485–67.197, P = 0.018) were the independent factors associated with significant functional improvement.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The independent factors affecting postoperative clinical outcome after PFO were KSS clinical score, CP angle and medial joint space width. In addition, the independent factors that influenced functional outcome included age, VAS score, KSS score, HKA angle and settlement value. As objective radiological evidence, HKA angle and settlement value could be used as an important basis for patient selection for PFO.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197980</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Proximal fibular osteotomy to treat medial compartment knee osteoarthritis: Preoperational factors for short-term prognosis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Liu, Wei Chen, Qi Zhang, Xiaoli Yan, Fei Zhang, Tianhua Dong, Guang Yang, Yingze Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Age (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.000–1.150, P = 0.048), VAS score (OR = 1.679, 95%CI = 1.041–2.706, P = 0.033), KSS clinical (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.005–1.144, P = 0.034) and functional (OR = 1.100, 95%CI = 1.044–1.159, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.345, 95%CI = 1.119–1.617, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 7.540, 95%CI = 1.307–43.484, P = 0.024) were the independent factors associated with functional satisfaction. KSS clinical (OR = 0.905, 95%CI = 0.850–0.963, P = 0.002) score, CP angle (OR = 0.760, 95%CI = 0.593–0.973, P = 0.030) and medial joint space width (OR = 0.001, 95%CI = 0.000–0.107, P = 0.003) were the independent factors associated with significant clinical improvement; VAS score (OR = 1.582, 95%CI = 1.042–2.402, P = 0.031), KSS functional (OR = 0.888, 95%CI = 0.838–0.942, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.292, 95%CI = 1.101–1.518, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 9.990, 95%CI = 1.485–67.197, P = 0.018) were the independent factors associated with significant functional improvement.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The independent factors affecting postoperative clinical outcome after PFO were KSS clinical score, CP angle and medial joint space width. In addition, the independent factors that influenced functional outcome included age, VAS score, KSS score, HKA angle and settlement value. As objective radiological evidence, HKA angle and settlement value could be used as an important basis for patient selection for PFO.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Bo Liu</name></author><fingerprint>95b1bb0a</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197980</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197980</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122a:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197494</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca Barwise-Munro, Maryam Al-Mahtot, Steve Turner&lt;/p&gt;
Mortality is higher for adults admitted to hospital and for babies born on weekends compared to weekdays. This study compares in-hospital mortality and in children admitted to hospital on weekends and weekdays. Details for all acute medical admissions to hospitals in Scotland for children aged ≤16 years between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; January 2000 and 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; December 2013 were obtained. Death was linked to day of admission. There were 570,403 acute medical admissions and 334 children died, including 83 who died after an admission on Saturday or Sunday and 251 who died following admission between Monday and Friday. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for a child dying after admission on a weekend compared to weekday was 1.03 [95% CI 0.80 to 1.32]. The OR for a child admitted over the weekend requiring intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) care was 1.24 [1.16 to 1.32], but the absolute number of admissions to HDU and ICU per day were similar on weekends and weekdays. We see no evidence of increased in-hospital paediatric mortality after admission on a weekend. The increased risk for admission to ITU or HDU with more serious illness over weekends is explained by fewer less serious admissions.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197494</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Mortality and other outcomes after paediatric hospital admission on the weekend compared to weekday</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca Barwise-Munro, Maryam Al-Mahtot, Steve Turner&lt;/p&gt;

When a phylogenetic tree can be built as a prior hypothesis to such classification, phylogenetic placement (PP) provides the most informative type of classification because each query sequence is assigned to its putative origin in the tree.

The placement is performed by inspecting the stored phylogenetic origins of the k-mers in the query, and their probabilities.

Although NF-{kappa}B signaling exhibits significant variability across single cells, some target genes exhibit fold-change detection of NF-{kappa}B, which may buffer against stochastic variation in signaling molecules.

Here we used a microfluidic cell-trapping device to measure how TNF-induced activation of NF-{kappa}B controls transcription in single Jurkat T cells at the promoters of integrated HIV and the endogenous cytokine gene IL6, which produce only a few transcripts per cell. We tracked TNF-stimulated NF-{kappa}B RelA nuclear translocation by live-cell imaging and then quantified transcript number by RNA FISH in the same cell. We found that TNF-induced transcription correlates with fold change in nuclear NF-{kappa}B with similar strength at low versus high abundance target genes. A computational model of TNF-NF-{kappa}B signaling, which implements fold-change detection from competition for binding to {kappa}B motifs, was sufficient to reproduce fold-change detection across the experimentally measured range of transcript outputs. Nevertheless, we found that gene-specific trends in transcriptional noise and levels of promoter-bound NF-{kappa}B predicted by the model were inconsistent with our experimental observations at low abundance gene targets.

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time. The model was used to forecast cholera incidence for the months after the passage of the hurricane (October-December 2016) and to predict the impact of a planned oral cholera vaccination campaign. Our first projection, from October 29 to December 31, predicted the highest incidence in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud, accounting for about 45% of the total cases in Haiti. The projection included a second peak in cholera incidence in early December largely driven by heavy rainfall forecasts, confirming the urgency for rapid intervention. A second projection (from November 12 to December 31) used updated rainfall forecasts to estimate that 835 cases would be averted by vaccinations in Grande Anse (90% Prediction Interval [PI] 476-1284) and 995 in Sud (90% PI 508-2043). The experience gained by this modeling effort shows that state-of-the-art computational modeling and data-assimilation methods can produce informative near real-time projections of cholera incidence. Collaboration among modelers and field epidemiologists is indispensable to gain fast access to field data and to translate model results into operational recommendations for emergency management during an outbreak. Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526504400000</published><fingerprint>a17c19d3</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006127</link><title>Near real-time forecasting for cholera decision making in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Damiano Pasetto, Flavio Finger, Anton Camacho, Francesco Grandesso, Sandra Cohuet, Joseph C.

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;.

The type C feruloyl esterase FoFaeC from &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; is a newly discovered enzyme with high potential for use in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass but it shows low activity towards sinapates. In this work, small molecule docking simulations were employed in order to identify important residues for the binding of the four model methyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids, methyl ferulate/caffeate/sinapate/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumarate, to the predicted structure of FoFaeC. Subsequently rational redesign was applied to the enzyme’ active site in order to improve its specificity towards methyl sinapate. A double mutation (F230H/T202V) was considered to provide hydrophobic environment for stabilization of the methoxy substitution on sinapate and a larger binding pocket. Five mutant clones and the wild type were produced in &lt;i&gt;Pichia pastoris&lt;/i&gt; and biochemically characterized. All clones showed improved activity, substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and turnover rate compared to the wild type against methyl sinapate, with clone P13 showing a 5-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency. Although the affinity of all mutant clones was improved against the four model substrates, the catalytic efficiency and turnover rate decreased for the substrates containing a hydroxyl substitution.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198127</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Tailoring the specificity of the type C feruloyl esterase FoFaeC from &amp;lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&amp;lt;/i&gt; towards methyl sinapate by rational redesign based on small molecule docking simulations</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Io Antonopoulou, Cameron Hunt, Gabriella Cerullo, Simona Varriale, Alexandra Gerogianni, Vincenza Faraco, Ulrika Rova, Paul Christakopoulos&lt;/p&gt;

To examine the 20-year trends in the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity among children aged 0–6 years between 1995 and 2015 in Harbin, China, we selected altogether 49,553 children aged 0–6 years old by using a multistage stratified cluster sampling methods in Harbin, one provincial capital city in northeast China in 1995, 2005 and 2015. Height and weight information of the children were collected. We used the child growth standards of World Health Organization to calculate the Z-scores for body mass index (BMI). Cut-offs recommended by World Health Organization and International Obesity Task Force were used to define overweight and obesity for each children. We found there is no difference between boys’ BMI and girls’ among newborns in each survey point (p&gt;0.05), but in older age groups, the BMI of boys was higher than that of girls (p&amp;lt;0.05). From 1995 to 2015, the average BMI was increasing continuously among boys older than 42 months and girls older than 48 months (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for linear trend across year) in Harbin. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 2.6% in 1995 to 7.6% in 2015. For every 10-year the risk of combined overweight and obesity in children aged 0–6 years increased by 167% (95%CI: 146%, 188%, p&amp;lt;0.01). The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in most age subgroups showed an increasing trend over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for trend test across survey year). The age when the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity dramatically increased was earlier in 2015 than that in 2005 and 1995. In conclusion, there was an increasing trend of the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity during the past 20 years in Harbin and the age when the prevalence dramatically increased became earlier. Comprehensive intervention should be undertaken among younger children to prevent and control children’s overweight and obesity.</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198032</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>20-year trends in prevalence of overweight and obesity among children aged 0-6 in Harbin, China: A multiple cross-sectional study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Liu, Qin Li, Hui Li, Jia Li, Hai-Jun Wang, Bin Li&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Quick background for those not in the field: a great many three-dimensional molecules can exist in right-handed and left-handed mirror-image forms (enantiomers), exactly like pairs of shoes. They have the property of “chirality”. When this happens with drug compounds, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/28/right-hand-left-hand-either-hand&quot;&gt;generally the case&lt;/a&gt; that the two have different activities, because proteins in the body are chiral, too. Where that handedness comes from is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/12/15/chirality-from-chemical-supply-houses-to-life-as-we-know-it&quot;&gt;rather deep question&lt;/a&gt;. Separating enantiomers is generally done by using another chiral substance (making derivatives or salts of the parent compound or passing across a purification column loaded with some chiral solid phase].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of proposals in this vein, although it’s a minefield of subtlety (and of irreproducible experiments). But there are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/05/24/a_new_way_to_determine_chirality&quot;&gt;electromagnetic effects&lt;/a&gt; that are both theoretically feasible and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/05/enantioselectivity-with-microwaves&quot;&gt;experimentally real&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/05/09/science.aar4265.full&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt; seems to be another one. The paper starts off, I should note, with a brief history on the intersection of chirality and magnetism, a topic that involved heavy hitters like Pasteur, Lord Kelvin, and Pierre Curie in its early days. During my own career, I well recall reports of chiral induction in magnetic fields that had to be retracted to much embarrassment, so it does take some bravery to venture into this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors, a multicenter team from Israel, the US, Germany, and Poland, are taking advantage of a phenomenon called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). Simply put – and I’m not going to be able to put it at a much higher level – electron movement through molecules is affected by their chirality. And that means that charge distribution in two enantiomers has different spin polarization in each one. That led the group to wonder about the interaction of chiral molecules with perpendicularly-magnetized surfaces, which have been the subject of much research in thin-film “spintronic” applications. In theory, one enantiomer could be attracted to such a surface much more than the other, depending on the direction of the magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just what happens. They picked a test helical polyalanine peptide and a gold-layered ferromagnet film (the gold is to protect it from oxidation, and the behavior of the exact peptide on gold layers had already been studied in other contexts). Attaching nanoparticles to the peptide (for visualization) and exposing these to the surface showed (by electron microscopy) a dramatic difference based on the direction of the perpendicular magnetic field. In one direction, the particles stick, and in the other they don’t. If the magnetization is in-plane (instead of perpendicular), there’s no difference, and there’s no difference if you’re applying an external magnetic field instead. It has to be a field associated with the thin layer, and it has to be in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also prepared a 50/50 mix of D- and L-peptides, and this (as it should) shows no circular dichroism. But after multiple exposures to fresh magnetic surfaces, the solution was clearly enriched in one enantiomer, and began to show circular dichroism as expected, increasing with the number of exposures. They then set this up as a flow experiment, and the results were unmistakeable: flowing an an enantiomeric mixture of two peptides down an unmagnetized column gave the same racemic mixture out the other end. But when the surface was magnetized “perpendicular down”, they got a strong CD spectrum from the eluent, and when it was magnetized “perpendicular up”, they got the mirror-image CD spectrum: the other enantiomer. The D enantiomers interact with the down-magnetized surfaces and the L enantiomers with the up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just peptides, either. A DNA oligomer was shown to bind to one magnetization and not the other, and the effect was reproduced with the single amino acid cysteine. In each case the kinetics are different for different sorts of molecules, different at various concentrations, and different between the enantiomers. The system thus has to be tuned for the best separation, but the effect is real across all of them. And that immediately suggests a whole new kind of chromatography:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The enantioselective interaction of chiral molecules with a magnetic substrate, presented in this article, provides a potentially generic chromatographic method for enantioseparation, which does not require a specific separating column. Because the observed effect depends on the electrical polarizability of the system (that is accompanied by spin polarization) and because this polarization depends on the global structure of the chiral molecule, the method described here may also allow the separation of chiral molecules from a mixture of molecules, either chiral or achiral. In addition, this technique could potentially be applied for separating chiral molecules based on their secondary structure and/or for separating two secondary structures of the same chiral molecule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would appear that a completely new analytical method has been invented, and I very much look forward to seeing what can be made out of it. We’re going to have to learn to think about chiral separations in a completely different way than we’re used to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Using 3D anatomical landmarks from adult human head MRIs, we assessed the magnitude of inter-operator differences in Procrustes-based geometric morphometric analyses. An in depth analysis of both absolute and relative error was performed in a subsample of individuals with replicated digitization by three different operators. The effect of inter-operator differences was also explored in a large sample of more than 900 individuals. Although absolute error was not unusual for MRI measurements, including bone landmarks, shape was particularly affected by differences among operators, with up to more than 30% of sample variation accounted for by this type of error. The magnitude of the bias was such that it dominated the main pattern of bone and total (all landmarks included) shape variation, largely surpassing the effect of sex differences between hundreds of men and women. In contrast, however, we found higher reproducibility in soft-tissue nasal landmarks, despite relatively larger errors in estimates of nasal size. Our study exemplifies the assessment of measurement error using geometric morphometrics on landmarks from MRIs and stresses the importance of relating it to total sample variance within the specific methodological framework being used. In summary, precise landmarks may not necessarily imply negligible errors, especially in shape data; indeed, size and shape may be differentially impacted by measurement error and different types of landmarks may have relatively larger or smaller errors. Importantly, and consistently with other recent studies using geometric morphometrics on digital images (which, however, were not specific to MRI data), this study showed that inter-operator biases can be a major source of error in the analysis of large samples, as those that are becoming increasingly common in the &apos;era of big data&apos;.</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197675</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Procrustes-based geometric morphometrics on MRI images: An example of inter-operator bias in 3D landmarks and its impact on big datasets</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Amro Daboul, Tatyana Ivanovska, Robin Bülow, Reiner Biffar, Andrea Cardini&lt;/p&gt;

And that’s the currency of the realm: do you want to build up larger molecules from smaller precursors in a controlled fashion? You’re going to have to make bonds when and where you want them to form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those organometallic reagents are tricky beasts, whether catalytic or stoichiometric. Just understanding what the actual structures of some of them are has occupied people for years on end, because a given system can adopt a whole range of structures – and thus form completely different reagents – depending on solvent, temperature, counterions, concentration, added salts, stoichiometry, order of addition, and so on. To make matters more interesting, some of the actual reactive species are formed only in small, transient amounts, which makes proving their existence even more fraught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201802087&quot;&gt;a recent example&lt;/a&gt;. One of the many things you can do with Grignard reagents, a classic organometallic species if ever there was, is to couple them onto vinyl bromides and haloalkenes in general, with iron catalysis. It turns out, though, that the yields for this are far better when the reaction is run in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) than in any other solvent (an effect discovered in 1998, over twenty years since the reaction was first reported). That one’s not exactly the first choice for this sort of thing, so it’s interesting to know that it works so well. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-300x180.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-300x180.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-768x460.jpeg 768w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP.jpeg 996w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13567&quot; height=&quot;180&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had already been figured out that if you take methylmagnesium bromide and an iron(III) salt in THF, that a new species forms: magnesium(penta-THF) chloride cation and a penta-iron-octa-methyl cluster anion. That was thought to be the active methyl-coupling reagent, but the yields are never that great in THF (which is probably what led to the solvent screening work that uncovered the NMP effect). Now we finally know what that works. In that new solvent, a completely different complex salt forms: magnesium hexa-NMP cation (+2 charge), with two trimethyliron anions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those irons are exceptionally reactive; you really don’t see alkyliron species without other stabilizing ligands on them very often, but for some reason you get them here. NMP is a pretty highly coordinating solvent, so in the absence of experimental evidence you’d figure that the solvent is in there on both the iron and magnesium centers. But it turns out that it’s just the latter (as suggested by magnetic circular dichroism spectra in solution, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ssbauer_spectroscopy&quot;&gt;Mössbauer spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; along with X-ray diffraction on isolated crystals of the complex. Mössbauer is not the first technique you reach for (since you need an appropriate gamma-ray source) but it’s extremely sensitive to several different kinds of changes that affect the energy levels of sensitive nuclei, which are mostly metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know, and another piece of knowledge gets added to the organometallic pile, and another idea for future reagents and reactions gets queued up. Eventually we’ll understand this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Organometallic Oddities</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP.jpeg</url><width>996</width><height>596</height></visual><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><fingerprint>e25bf7f9</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/29/organometallic-oddities</href></item></alternate><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13566</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b778:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197886</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nikolas Schrod, Dimitri Vanhecke, Ulrike Laugks, Valentin Stein, Yoshiyuki Fukuda, Miroslava Schaffer, Wolfgang Baumeister, Vladan Lucic&lt;/p&gt;
Many cellular processes depend on a precise structural organization of molecular components. Here, we established that neurons grown in culture provide a suitable system for in situ structural investigations of cellular structures by cryo-electron tomography, a method that allows high resolution, three-dimensional imaging of fully hydrated, vitrified cellular samples. A higher level of detail of cellular components present in our images allowed us to quantitatively characterize presynaptic and cytoskeletal organization, as well as structures involved in axonal transport and endocytosis. In this way we provide a structural framework into which information from other methods need to fit. Importantly, we show that short pleomorphic linkers (tethers and connectors) extensively interconnect different types of spherical vesicles and other lipid membranes in neurons imaged in a close-to-native state. These linkers likely serve to organize and precisely position vesicles involved in endocytosis, axonal transport and synaptic release. Hence, structural interactions via short linkers may serve as ubiquitous vesicle organizers in neuronal cells.</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197886</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Pleomorphic linkers as ubiquitous structural organizers of vesicles in axons</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nikolas Schrod, Dimitri Vanhecke, Ulrike Laugks, Valentin Stein, Yoshiyuki Fukuda, Miroslava Schaffer, Wolfgang Baumeister, Vladan Lucic&lt;/p&gt;

The present work set out to search for a virulence repertoire distinctive for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; causing primitive acute pyelonephritis (APN). To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;, but a lower prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cnf1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;kpsMT-II&lt;/i&gt;. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a higher proportion of two gene clusters (&lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt;) were detected in the APN and RC groups than in CO, whereas &lt;i&gt;iutA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; clusters were detected more frequently in APN strains. The motility level did not differ among the study-groups and phylogroups considered, although a higher proportion of swarming strains was observed in APN strains. Antibiotic-resistance rates were generally low except for ampicillin (37.7%), and were not associated with specific study- or phylogenetic groups. APN and RC strains produced more biofilm than CO strains.

Betting odds are frequently found to outperform mathematical models in sports related forecasting tasks, however the factors contributing to betting odds are not fully traceable and in contrast to rating-based forecasts no straightforward measure of team-specific quality is deducible from the betting odds. The present study investigates the approach of combining the methods of mathematical models and the information included in betting odds. A soccer forecasting model based on the well-known ELO rating system and taking advantage of betting odds as a source of information is presented. Data from almost 15.000 soccer matches (seasons 2007/2008 until 2016/2017) are used, including both domestic matches (English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish Primera Division and Italian Serie A) and international matches (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europe League). The novel betting odds based ELO model is shown to outperform classic ELO models, thus demonstrating that betting odds prior to a match contain more relevant information than the result of the match itself. It is shown how the novel model can help to gain valuable insights into the quality of soccer teams and its development over time, thus having a practical benefit in performance analysis. Moreover, it is argued that network based approaches might help in further improving rating and forecasting methods.</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The Betting Odds Rating System: Using soccer forecasts to forecast soccer</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fabian Wunderlich, Daniel Memmert&lt;/p&gt;

Oxygen is required for the completion of almost all known metazoan lifecycles, but many metazoans harbour abilities to withstand varying degrees and periods of hypoxia. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, one of the most popular model organism is extensively used as a model for the study of hypoxia and anoxia biology and it has been found that this nematode is capable of tolerance to varying degrees of hypoxia. Considering the extremely high diversity of nematodes, the effects of low oxygen concentration and mechanisms of adaptation to oxygen depletion differ among species. In this study, we used a simple assay to examine anoxia tolerance in four nematode species, including three free-living and one plant parasitic nematode.

Oxygen is required for the completion of almost all known metazoan lifecycles, but many metazoans harbour abilities to withstand varying degrees and periods of hypoxia. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, one of the most popular model organism is extensively used as a model for the study of hypoxia and anoxia biology and it has been found that this nematode is capable of tolerance to varying degrees of hypoxia. Considering the extremely high diversity of nematodes, the effects of low oxygen concentration and mechanisms of adaptation to oxygen depletion differ among species. In this study, we used a simple assay to examine anoxia tolerance in four nematode species, including three free-living and one plant parasitic nematode. We found that the plant parasitic nematode &lt;i&gt;Bursaphelenchus xylophilus&lt;/i&gt; can survive more than 14 days under anoxic conditions. Comparisons of behaviour during anoxia induction and the repertoire of oxygen sensation genes among the tested species suggested the existence of different oxygen sensation systems between &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;xylophilus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;, which quickly introduce suspended animation in response to oxygen depletion to survive long-term anoxia.</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Hiromi Kitazume</name></author><fingerprint>5ef7a3f2</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197122</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197122</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>50</engagement><crawled>1527862122771</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163bbadd913:37fb7e9:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05323-6</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marketing personalized cancer treatments requires careful language&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing personalized cancer treatments requires careful language, Published online: 01 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05323-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05323-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Therapies tailored to individual tumours must not be oversold.</description><published>1527836400000</published><engagementRate>0.57</engagementRate><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05323-6</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marketing personalized cancer treatments requires careful language&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing personalized cancer treatments requires careful language, Published online: 01 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05323-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05323-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Therapies tailored to individual tumours must not be oversold.</content></content><title>Marketing personalized cancer treatments requires careful language</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05323-6/d41586-018-05323-6_15811136.jpg</url><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><fingerprint>31ca06e7</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05323-6</href></item></alternate></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Sensory experience plays an important role in shaping neural circuitry by affecting the synaptic connectivity and intrinsic properties of individual neurons.

Current 16S profiling methods, however, fail to provide sufficient taxonomic resolution and accuracy to adequately perform species-level associative studies for specific conditions. This is due to the amplification and sequencing of only short 16S rRNA gene regions, typically providing for only family- or genus-level taxonomy. Moreover, sequencing errors often inflate the number of taxa present. Pacific Biosciences&apos; (PacBio&apos;s) long-read technology in particular suffers from high error rates per base. Herein we present a microbiome analysis pipeline that takes advantage of PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) technology to sequence and error correct full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes, which provides high-fidelity species-level microbiome data. Results: Analysis of a mock community with 20 bacterial species demonstrated 100% specificity and sensitivity. Examination of a 250-plus species mock community demonstrated correct species-level classification of &gt;90% of taxa and relative abundances were accurately captured. The vast majority of the remaining taxa were demonstrated to be multiply, incorrectly, or incompletely classified making true resolution difficult. Using this methodology we examined the microgeographic variation present among the microbiomes of six sinonasal sites, by both swab and biopsy, from the anterior nasal cavity to the sphenoid sinus from 12 subjects undergoing trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. We found greater variation among subjects than among sites within a subject, although significant within-individual differences were also observed. Propiniobacterium acnes (recently renamed Cutibacterium acnes [1]) was the predominant species throughout, but was found at distinct relative abundances by site. Conclusions: Our microbial composition analysis pipeline for single-molecule real-time 16S rRNA gene sequencing (MCSMRT, https://github.com/jpearl01/mcsmrt) overcomes deficits of standard marker gene based microbiome analyses by using CCS of entire 16S rRNA genes to provide increased taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution. Extensions of this approach to other marker genes could help refine taxonomic assignments of microbial species and improve reference databases, as well as strengthen the specificity of associations between microbial communities and dysbiotic states.</description><published>1528095600000</published><fingerprint>a2f63bd2</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/338731v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Pan-bacterial 16S rRNA microbiome surveys performed with massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies have transformed community microbiological studies.

Thus, production of CSF-1 by tumor cells leading to activation of PI3K p110α represents a novel cellular and molecular pathway mediating NKG2D ligand expression on tumor-associated macrophages.</description><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Cancer Biology</item><item>Immunology and Inflammation</item></keywords><title>Tumor-derived CSF-1 induces the NKG2D ligand RAE-1δ on tumor-infiltrating macrophages</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>raulet@berkeley.edu (Alexander Byungsuk Kim)</name></author><fingerprint>e159a07b</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32919</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32919</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b12450/20180509/images/medium/jp-2017-124503_0013.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12450&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The standard clinical approach to non-occupational HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) focuses on biomedical aspects of the intervention, but may overlook co-occurring or ‘syndemic’ psychosocial problems that reinforce future vulnerability to HIV. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence of syndemic health problems in a cohort of Ontario nPEP patients, and explored the relationship between syndemic burden and HIV risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between 07/2013-08/2016, we distributed a self-administered questionnaire to patients presenting to three clinics in Toronto and Ottawa seeking nPEP for sexual HIV exposures. We used validated screening tools to estimate the prevalence of depression (CES-D score ≥16), harmful alcohol use (AUDIT ≥8), problematic drug use (DUDIT ≥6 men/≥2 women), and sexual compulsivity (SCS ≥24) among men who have sex with men (MSM) respondents. In exploratory analyses, we examined the relationships between syndemic conditions using univariable logistic regression models, and the relationship between syndemic count (total number of syndemic conditions per participant) and HIV risk, as estimated by the HIRI-MSM score, using linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The 186 MSM included in the analysis had median age 31 (IQR = 26–36), including 87.6% having a college/undergraduate degree or higher. Overall, 53.8% screened positive for depression, 34.4% for harmful alcohol use, 30.1% for problematic drug use, and 16.1% for sexual compulsivity. Most participants (74.2%) had at least one syndemic condition and 46.8% had more than one. Exploratory analyses suggested positive associations between depression and harmful alcohol use (OR = 2.11, 95%CI = 1.13, 3.94) and between harmful alcohol use and problematic drug use (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 0.65, 2.29). Syndemic count was associated with increased HIRI-MSM risk scores in univariable (2.2, 95%CI = 1.0, 3.3 per syndemic condition) and multivariable (2.1, 95%CI = 0.6, 3.6) linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of syndemic conditions in MSM seeking nPEP for sexual exposure is alarmingly high, and is associated with underlying HIV risk. Routine screening for these conditions may identify opportunities for intervention and could alleviate future vulnerability to HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197998</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>High prevalence of syndemic health problems in patients seeking post-exposure prophylaxis for sexual exposures to HIV</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Steven A.

We therefore sought to determine the prevalence of syndemic health problems in a cohort of Ontario nPEP patients, and explored the relationship between syndemic burden and HIV risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between 07/2013-08/2016, we distributed a self-administered questionnaire to patients presenting to three clinics in Toronto and Ottawa seeking nPEP for sexual HIV exposures. We used validated screening tools to estimate the prevalence of depression (CES-D score ≥16), harmful alcohol use (AUDIT ≥8), problematic drug use (DUDIT ≥6 men/≥2 women), and sexual compulsivity (SCS ≥24) among men who have sex with men (MSM) respondents. In exploratory analyses, we examined the relationships between syndemic conditions using univariable logistic regression models, and the relationship between syndemic count (total number of syndemic conditions per participant) and HIV risk, as estimated by the HIRI-MSM score, using linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The 186 MSM included in the analysis had median age 31 (IQR = 26–36), including 87.6% having a college/undergraduate degree or higher. Overall, 53.8% screened positive for depression, 34.4% for harmful alcohol use, 30.1% for problematic drug use, and 16.1% for sexual compulsivity. Most participants (74.2%) had at least one syndemic condition and 46.8% had more than one. Exploratory analyses suggested positive associations between depression and harmful alcohol use (OR = 2.11, 95%CI = 1.13, 3.94) and between harmful alcohol use and problematic drug use (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 0.65, 2.29). Syndemic count was associated with increased HIRI-MSM risk scores in univariable (2.2, 95%CI = 1.0, 3.3 per syndemic condition) and multivariable (2.1, 95%CI = 0.6, 3.6) linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of syndemic conditions in MSM seeking nPEP for sexual exposure is alarmingly high, and is associated with underlying HIV risk. Routine screening for these conditions may identify opportunities for intervention and could alleviate future vulnerability to HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Steven A.

We compared the performance of DiTaxa to the state-of-the-art methods in disease phenotype prediction and biomarker detection, using human-associated 16S rRNA samples for periodontal disease, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as a synthetic benchmark dataset. DiTaxa identified 13 out of 21 taxa with confirmed links to periodontitis (recall=0.62), relative to 3 out of 21 taxa (recall=0.14) by the state-of-the-art method. On synthetic benchmark data, DiTaxa obtained full precision and recall in biomarker detection, compared to 0.91 and 0.90, respectively. In addition, machine-learning classifiers trained to predict host disease phenotypes based on the NPE representation performed competitively to the state-of-the art using OTUs or k-mers.

Loss or gain of copy number of the gene encoding the transcription factor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) leads to neurodevelopmental disorders (Rett and MeCP2 duplication syndrome), indicating that precisely regulated MeCP2 expression during development is critical for mental health. Consistent with this idea, MeCP2 null mutants exhibit synaptic regression in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the visual relay center in the thalamus, a phenotype resembling that of animals reared in the dark during the visual sensitive period. It remains unclear how MeCP2 expression is regulated during circuit formation and maturation, especially in excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons. We found that, concomitant with the initiation of the dark-rearing sensitive period, MeCP2 protein levels were elevated in glutamatergic but not GABAergic neurons of the dLGN. Moreover, MeCP2 expression in glutamatergic populations was selectively reduced by dark-rearing. Therefore, we propose that visual experience–dependent MeCP2 induction in glutamatergic populations is essential for synaptic maturation within the dLGN.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198268</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Experience-dependent MeCP2 expression in the excitatory cells of mouse visual thalamus</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Yagasaki, Goichi Miyoshi, Mariko Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196984</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>First record of &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; formation of ectomycorrhizae in &amp;lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&amp;lt;/i&gt; Sabine, a native Myrtaceae of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is modeled to explore the mechanisms of this effective, but poorly understood, treatment for motor symptoms of drug-refractory Parkinson’s disease and dystonia. First, a neural field model of the corticothalamic-basal ganglia (CTBG) system is developed that reproduces key clinical features of Parkinson’s disease, including its characteristic 4–8 Hz and 13–30 Hz electrophysiological signatures. Deep brain stimulation of the STN is then modeled and shown to suppress the pathological 13–30 Hz (beta) activity for physiologically realistic and optimized stimulus parameters. This supports the idea that suppression of abnormally coherent activity in the CTBG system is a major factor in DBS therapy for Parkinson’s disease, by permitting normal dynamics to resume. At high stimulus intensities, nonlinear effects in the target population mediate wave-wave interactions between resonant beta activity and the stimulus pulse train, leading to complex spectral structure that shows remarkable similarity to that seen in steady-state evoked potential experiments.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nyh-p6NdIb8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><fingerprint>a327ceb6</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006217</link><title>Quantitative theory of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus for the suppression of pathological rhythms in Parkinson’s disease</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eli J.

Urbanization has been driven by various social, economic, and political factors around the world for centuries. Because urbanization continues unabated in many places, it is crucial to understand patterns of urbanization and their potential ecological and environmental impacts. Given this need, the objectives of our study were to quantify urban growth rates, growth modes, and resultant changes in the landscape pattern of urbanization in Hanoi, Vietnam from 1993 to 2010 and to evaluate the extent to which the process of urban growth in Hanoi conformed to the diffusion-coalescence theory. We analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of the built-up land in Hanoi using landscape expansion modes, spatial metrics, and a gradient approach. Urbanization was most pronounced in the periods of 2001–2006 and 2006–2010 at a distance of 10 to 35 km around the urban center. Over the 17 year period urban expansion in Hanoi was dominated by infilling and edge expansion growth modes. Our findings support the diffusion-coalescence theory of urbanization. The shift of the urban growth areas over time and the dynamic nature of the spatial metrics revealed important information about our understanding of the urban growth process and cycle. Furthermore, our findings can be used to evaluate urban planning policies and aid in urbanization issues in rapidly urbanizing countries.</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196940</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Quantifying urban growth patterns in Hanoi using landscape expansion modes and time series spatial metrics</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Duong H.

Although heterosis has significantly contributed to increases in worldwide crop production, the molecular mechanisms regulating this phenomenon are still unknown. In the present study, we used a comparative proteomic approach to explore hybrid vigor via the proteome of both the popcorn L54 ♀ and P8 ♂ genotypes and the resultant UENF/UEM01 hybrid cross. To analyze the differentially abundant proteins involved in heterosis, we used the primary roots of these genotypes to analyze growth parameters and extract proteins. The results of the growth parameter analysis showed that the mid- and best-parent heterosis were positive for root length and root dry matter but negative for root fresh matter, seedling fresh matter, and protein content. The comparative proteomic analysis identified 1343 proteins in the primary roots of hybrid UENF/UEM01 and its parental lines; 220 proteins were differentially regulated in terms of protein abundance. The mass spectrometry proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier “PXD009436”. A total of 62 regulated proteins were classified as nonadditive, of which 53.2% were classified as high parent abundance (+), 17.8% as above-high parent abundance (+ +), 16.1% as below-low parent abundance (− −), and 12.9% as low parent abundance (-). A total of 22 biological processes were associated with nonadditive proteins; processes involving translation, ribosome biogenesis, and energy-related metabolism represented 45.2% of the nonadditive proteins. Our results suggest that heterosis in the popcorn hybrid UENF/UEM01 at an early stage of plant development is associated with an up-regulation of proteins related to synthesis and energy metabolism.</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197114</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Differentially abundant proteins associated with heterosis in the primary roots of popcorn</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mathias F.

Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a degenerative disease characterized by corneal endothelial decompensation. FECD causes corneal stromal and epithelial edema and progressively develops into bullous keratopathy, which can eventually lead to blindness. However, the exact pathogenesis is unknown. In this study, we performed an in-depth bioinformatic analysis of the dataset GSE74123 to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of symptomatic late-onset FECD compared with a normal control. Gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis were used to analyze the pathological molecular mechanism of FECD. We found that cell senescence, reactive oxygen species (ROS), the extracellular matrix (ECM), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune response-related genes play an important role in the pathological development of symptomatic late-onset FECD.

Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a degenerative disease characterized by corneal endothelial decompensation. FECD causes corneal stromal and epithelial edema and progressively develops into bullous keratopathy, which can eventually lead to blindness. However, the exact pathogenesis is unknown. In this study, we performed an in-depth bioinformatic analysis of the dataset GSE74123 to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of symptomatic late-onset FECD compared with a normal control. Gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis were used to analyze the pathological molecular mechanism of FECD. We found that cell senescence, reactive oxygen species (ROS), the extracellular matrix (ECM), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune response-related genes play an important role in the pathological development of symptomatic late-onset FECD. In addition, we revealed that down-regulated IL-6, enhanced NF-κB activity and a suite of orchestrated chemokine responses induce fibrocyte differentiation from monocyte to dendritic cell maturation. PI3K plays a key role in the molecular mechanism of symptomatic late-onset FECD. This study enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanism of FECD pathogenesis and will improve the diagnostics and therapy of FECD patients in the future.</content></content><updated>1527022800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Zekai Cui</name></author><fingerprint>73b07b7d</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197750</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197750</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>149</engagement><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395a8:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/783?rss=1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electroreduction could provide a useful source of ethylene, but low conversion efficiency, low production rates, and low catalyst stability limit current systems.

Várzea forests account for 17% of the Amazon basin and endure an annual inundation that can reach 14 m deep during 6–8 months. This flood pulse in combination with topography directly influences the várzea vegetation cover. Assemblages of several taxa differ significantly between unflooded &lt;i&gt;terra firme&lt;/i&gt; and flooded várzea forests, but little is known about the distribution of medium and large sized terrestrial mammals in várzea habitats. Therefore, our goal was to understand how those habitats influence mammalian species distribution during the dry season. Specifically, we: (1) compared the species composition between a terra firme (Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve) and a várzea forest (Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve); and (2) tested the influence of the várzea habitat classes on the number of records, occurrence and species composition of mammalian assemblages. The sampling design in each reserve consisted of 50 baited camera trap stations, with an overall sampling effort of 5015 camera trap days. We used Non-Metric Multidimension Scaling (NMDS) to compare species composition between terra firme and várzea forests, and used Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to assess how habitat types and a habitat diversity index affect mammal distributions. We recorded 21 medium and large sized mammalian species, including 20 species in terra firme and only six in várzea (3443 records). Flood pulse and isolation in várzea forest drove the dissimilarity between these two forest types. In várzea forest, medium size mammals, in general, avoided habitats associated with long flooding periods, while jaguars (&lt;i&gt;Panthera onca&lt;/i&gt;) appeared to prefer aquatic/terrestrial transition zones. Habitats that remain dry for longer periods showed more mammalian occurrence, suggesting that dispersion via soil is important even for semi-arboreal species. This is the first study to evaluate differential use of várzea habitats by terrestrial mammalian assemblages.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198120</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Spatial patterns of medium and large size mammal assemblages in várzea and terra firme forests, Central Amazonia, Brazil</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guilherme Costa Alvarenga, Emiliano Esterci Ramalho, Fabrício Beggiato Baccaro, Daniel Gomes da Rocha, Jefferson Ferreira-Ferreira, Paulo Estefano Dineli Bobrowiec&lt;/p&gt;

A striking example is provided by cyanobacteria, which perform photosynthesis during the day to fix carbon. These organisms not only face the challenge of rewiring their proteome every 12 hours, but also the necessity of storing the fixed carbon in the form of glycogen to fuel processes during the night. In this manuscript, we extend the framework developed by Hwa and coworkers (Scott et al., Science 330, 1099 (2010)) for quantifying the relatinship between growth and proteome composition to circadian metabolism. We then apply this framework to investigate the circadian metabolism of the cyanobacterium Cyanothece, which not only fixes carbon during the day, but also nitrogen during the night, storing it in the polymer cyanophycin. Our analysis reveals that the need to store carbon and nitrogen tends to generate an extreme growth strategy, in which the cells predominantly grow during the day, as observed experimentally. This strategy maximizes the growth rate over 24 hours, and can be quantitatively understood by the bacterial growth laws. Our analysis also shows that the slow relaxation of the proteome, arising from the slow growth rate, puts a severe constraint on implementing this optimal strategy. Yet, the capacity to estimate the time of the day, enabled by the circadian clock, makes it possible to anticipate the daily changes in the environment and mount a response ahead of time. This significantly enhances the growth rate by counteracting the detrimental effects of the slow proteome relaxation.</description><published>1526281200000</published><fingerprint>19af293b</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321364v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Many organisms repartition their proteome in a circadian fashion in response to the daily nutrient changes in their environment.

Merosin deficient congenital muscular dystrophy 1A (MDC1A) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;LAMA2&lt;/i&gt; gene leading to severe and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Although over 350 causative mutations have been identified for MDC1A, no treatment is yet available. There are many therapeutic approaches in development, but the lack of natural history data of the mouse model and standardized outcome measures makes it difficult to transit these pre-clinical findings to clinical trials. Therefore, in the present study, we collected natural history data and assessed pre-clinical outcome measures for the &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model using standardized operating procedures available from the TREAT-NMD Alliance. Wild type and &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice were subjected to five different functional tests from the age of four to 32 weeks. Non-tested control groups were taken along to assess whether the functional test regime interfered with muscle pathology. Respiratory function, body weights and creatine kinase levels were recorded. Lastly, skeletal muscles were collected for further histopathological and gene expression analyses. Muscle function of &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice was severely impaired at four weeks of age and all mice lost the ability to use their hind limbs. Moreover, respiratory function was altered in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Interestingly, the respiration rate was decreased and declined with age, whereas the respiration amplitude was increased in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice when compared to wild type mice. Creatine kinase levels were comparable to wild type mice. Muscle histopathology and gene expression analysis revealed that there was a specific regional distribution pattern of muscle damage in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Gastrocnemius appeared to be the most severely affected muscle with a high proportion of atrophic fibers, increased fibrosis and inflammation. By contrast, triceps was affected moderately and diaphragm only mildly.

Repositioning of the maxilla in orthognathic surgery is carried out for functional and aesthetic purposes. Pre-surgical planning tools can predict 3D facial appearance by computing the response of the soft tissue to the changes to the underlying skeleton. The clinical use of commercial prediction software remains controversial, likely due to the deterministic nature of these computational predictions. A novel probabilistic finite element model (FEM) for the prediction of postoperative facial soft tissues is proposed in this paper. A probabilistic FEM was developed and validated on a cohort of eight patients who underwent maxillary repositioning and had pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken. Firstly, a variables correlation assessed various modelling parameters. Secondly, a design of experiments (DOE) provided a range of potential outcomes based on uniformly distributed input parameters, followed by an optimisation. Lastly, the second DOE iteration provided optimised predictions with a probability range. A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>A novel soft tissue prediction methodology for orthognathic surgery based on probabilistic finite element modelling</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paul G.

Information on circulating miRNAs in frontotemporal lobar degeneration is very limited and conflicting results have complicated an interpretation in Alzheimer’s disease thus far. In the present study we I) collected samples from multiple clinical centers across Germany, II) defined 3 homogenous patient groups with high sample sizes (bvFTD n = 48, AD n = 48 and cognitively healthy controls n = 44), III) compared expression levels in both CSF and serum samples and IV) detected a limited set of miRNAs by using a MIQE compliant protocol based on SYBR-green miRCURY assays that have proven reliable to generate reproducible results. We included several quality controls that identified and reduced technical variation to increase the reliability of our data. We showed that the expression levels of circulating miRNAs measured in CSF did not correlate with levels in serum. Using cluster analysis we found expression pattern in serum that, in part, reflects the genomic organization and affiliation to a specific miRNA family and that were specifically altered in bvFTD, AD, and control groups. Applying factor analysis we identified a 3-factor model characterized by a miRNA signature that explained 80% of the variance classifying healthy controls with 97%, bvFTD with 77% and AD with 72% accuracy. MANOVA confirmed signals like miR-320a and miR-26b-5p at BH corrected significance that contributed most to discriminate bvFTD cases with 96% sensitivity and 90% specificity and AD cases with 89% sensitivity and specificity compared to healthy controls, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that miRNAs from the 3-factor model also correlated with levels of protein biomarker amyloid-beta&lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, indicating their potential role in the monitoring of progressive neuronal degeneration. Our data show that miRNAs can be reproducibly measured in serum and CSF without pre-amplification and that serum includes higher expressed signals that demonstrate an overall better ability to classify bvFTD, AD and healthy controls compared to signals detected in CSF.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197329</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Specific serum and CSF microRNA profiles distinguish sporadic behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia compared with Alzheimer patients and cognitively healthy controls</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Johannes Denk, Felix Oberhauser, Johannes Kornhuber, Jens Wiltfang, Klaus Fassbender, Matthias L.

Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Local dynamic stability during gait for predicting falls in elderly people: A one-year prospective study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lucia Bizovska, Zdenek Svoboda, Miroslav Janura, Maria Cristina Bisi, Nicolas Vuillerme&lt;/p&gt;

The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Lucia Bizovska</name></author><fingerprint>c17a217f</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bc8:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198269</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marco Fiorentino, Fadi A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several studies have shown that long-term survival after acute kidney injury (AKI) is reduced even if there is clinical recovery. However, we recently reported that in septic shock patients those that recover from AKI have survival similar to patients without AKI. Here, we studied a cohort with less severe sepsis to examine the effects of AKI on longer-term survival as a function of recovery by discharge.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed patients with community-acquired pneumonia from the Genetic and Inflammatory Markers of Sepsis (GenIMS) cohort. We included patients who developed AKI (KDIGO stages 2–3) and defined renal recovery as alive at hospital discharge with return of SCr to within 150% of baseline without dialysis. Our primary outcome was survival up to 3 years analyzed using Gray’s model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 1742 patients who survived to hospital discharge, stage 2–3 AKI occurred in 262 (15%), of which 111 (42.4%) recovered. Compared to recovered patients, patients without recovery were older (75 ±14 vs 69 ±15 years, p&amp;lt;0.001) and were more likely to have at least stage 1 AKI on day 1 (83% vs 52%, p&amp;lt;0.001). Overall, 445 patients (25.5%) died during follow-up, 23.4% (347/1480) for no AKI, 28% (31/111) for AKI with recovery and 44.3% (67/151) for AKI without recovery. Patients who did not recover had worse survival compared to no AKI (HR range 1.05–2.46, p = 0.01), while recovering patients had similar survival compared to no AKI (HR 1.01, 95%CI 0.69–1.47, p = 0.96). Absence of AKI on day 1, no in-hospital renal replacement therapy (RRT), higher Apache III score and higher baseline SCr were associated with recovery after AKI.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In patients with sepsis, recovery by hospital discharge is associated with long-term survival similar to patients without AKI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Long-term survival in patients with septic acute kidney injury is strongly influenced by renal recovery</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marco Fiorentino, Fadi A.

While previous work has shown that the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification is a useful, though subjective, feature for predicting surgical outcomes, obtaining this classification requires a clinician to review the patient&apos;s medical records. Our goal here is to create an improved risk score using electronic medical records and demonstrate its utility in predicting in-hospital mortality without requiring clinician-derived ASA scores. Methods: Data from 49,513 surgical patients were used to train logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted tree classifiers for predicting in-hospital mortality. The features used are readily available before surgery from EMR databases. A gradient boosted tree regression model was trained to impute the ASA Physical Status Classification, and this new, imputed score was included as an additional feature to preoperatively predict in-hospital post-surgical mortality. The preoperative risk prediction was then used as an input feature to a deep neural network (DNN), along with intraoperative features, to predict postoperative in-hospital mortality risk. Performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: We found that the random forest classifier (AUC 0.921, 95%CI 0.908-0.934) outperforms logistic regression (AUC 0.871, 95%CI 0.841-0.900) and gradient boosted trees (AUC 0.897, 95%CI 0.881-0.912) in predicting in-hospital post-surgical mortality. Using logistic regression, the ASA Physical Status Classification score alone had an AUC of 0.865 (95%CI 0.848-0.882). Adding preoperative features to the ASA Physical Status Classification improved the random forest AUC to 0.929 (95%CI 0.915-0.943). Using only automatically obtained preoperative features with no clinician intervention, we found that the random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.921 (95%CI 0.908-0.934). Integrating the preoperative risk prediction into the DNN for postoperative risk prediction results in an AUC of 0.924 (95%CI 0.905-0.941), and with both a preoperative and postoperative risk score for each patient, we were able to show that the mortality risk changes over time. Conclusions: Features easily extracted from EMR data can be used to preoperatively predict the risk of in-hospital post-surgical mortality in a fully automated fashion, with accuracy comparable to models trained on features that require clinical expertise. This preoperative risk score can then be compared to the postoperative risk score to show that the risk changes, and therefore should be monitored longitudinally over time.</description><published>1527231600000</published><fingerprint>9921f40d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329813v2?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Predicting preoperative in-hospital mortality using readily-available electronic medical record (EMR) data can aid clinicians in accurately and rapidly determining surgical risk.

However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change, favorably or unfavorably, if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is often limited because these complex relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality and morbidity. Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal networks. Unlike approaches limited to predicting simple drug-drug interaction values, Decagon can predict the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well polypharmacy side effects that have a strong molecular basis, while on predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon opens up opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient population data to flag and prioritize polypharmacy side effects for follow-up analysis via formal pharmacological studies.</description><published>1526626800000</published><fingerprint>c5ee0d2d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/258814v2?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common to treat patients with complex diseases or co-existing conditions.

We propose an optoelectronic system for stimulation of living neurons. The system consists of an electronic circuit based on the FitzHugh–Nagumo model, an optical fiber, and a photoelectrical converter. We used this system for electrical stimulation of hippocampal living neurons in acute hippocampal brain slices (350-μm thick) obtained from a 20–28 days old C57BL/6 mouse or a Wistar rat. The main advantage of our system over other similar stimulators is that it contains an optical fiber for signal transmission instead of metallic wires. The fiber is placed between the electronic circuit and stimulated neurons and provides galvanic isolation from external electrical and magnetic fields. The use of the optical fiber allows avoiding electromagnetic noise and current flows which could affect metallic wires. Furthermore, it gives us the possibility to simulate “synaptic plasticity” by adaptive signal transfer through optical fiber. The proposed optoelectronic system (hybrid neural circuit) provides a very high efficiency in stimulating hippocampus neurons and can be used for restoring brain activity in particular regions or replacing brain parts (neuroprosthetics) damaged due to a trauma or neurodegenerative diseases.</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198396</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Optoelectronic system for brain neuronal network stimulation</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mikhail A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX) and Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) are used as formative assessments worldwide. Since an up-to-date comprehensive synthesis of the educational impact of Mini-CEX and DOPS is lacking, we performed a systematic review. Moreover, as the educational impact might be influenced by characteristics of the setting in which Mini-CEX and DOPS take place or their implementation status, we additionally investigated these potential influences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We searched Scopus, Web of Science, and Ovid, including All Ovid Journals, Embase, ERIC, Ovid MEDLINE(R), and PsycINFO, for original research articles investigating the educational impact of Mini-CEX and DOPS on undergraduate and postgraduate trainees from all health professions, published in English or German from 1995 to 2016. Educational impact was operationalized and classified using Barr’s adaptation of Kirkpatrick’s four-level model. Where applicable, outcomes were pooled in meta-analyses, separately for Mini-CEX and DOPS. To examine potential influences, we used Fisher’s exact test for count data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified 26 articles demonstrating heterogeneous effects of Mini-CEX and DOPS on learners’ reactions (Kirkpatrick Level 1) and positive effects of Mini-CEX and DOPS on trainees’ performance (Kirkpatrick Level 2b; Mini-CEX: &lt;i&gt;standardized mean difference (SMD)&lt;/i&gt; = 0.26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.014; DOPS: &lt;i&gt;SMD&lt;/i&gt; = 3.33, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).

Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 μg/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male &lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&lt;/i&gt;. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 μg/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197259</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Environmental concentrations of metformin exposure affect aggressive behavior in the Siamese fighting fish, &amp;lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ronald David MacLaren, Kathryn Wisniewski, Christina MacLaren&lt;/p&gt;

Further, weak positive correlations have been observed between gene body 5hmC and gene expression. We previously demonstrated that ME-Class, which uses a high-resolution model of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, is an effective tool to understand relationships between 5mC and expression. In this work, we present ME-Class2, a machine-learning based tool to perform integrative 5mCG, 5hmCG and expression analysis. Using ME-Class2 we analyze whole-genome single-base resolution 5mC and 5hmC datasets from 20 primary tissue and cell samples to uncover relationships between 5hmC and expression. The addition of 5hmC improves model performance for tissues with high-levels of 5hmC such as the brain. Our analysis further indicates that conversion of 5mC to 5hmC within 2kb of the transcription start site associates with distinct functions depending on the summed level of 5mC + 5hmC. Unchanged levels of 5mC + 5hmC (i.e. conversion from 5mC to stable 5hmC) associate with repression. Meanwhile, decreases in 5mC + 5hmC (i.e. 5hmC-mediated demethylation) associate with gene activation. As more large-scale, genome-wide, differential DNA methylation studies become available, tools such as ME-Class2 will prove invaluable to interpret epigenomic data and guide mechanistic studies into the function of 5hmC.</description><published>1525935600000</published><fingerprint>164bf888</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318808v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Since the discovery of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) as a prominent DNA base modification found in mammalian genomes, an emergent question has been what role this mark plays in gene regulation. 5hmC is hypothesized to function as an intermediate in the demethylation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and also in reactivation of silenced regulatory elements, including promoters and enhancers.

We previously demonstrated that ME-Class, which uses a high-resolution model of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, is an effective tool to understand relationships between 5mC and expression. In this work, we present ME-Class2, a machine-learning based tool to perform integrative 5mCG, 5hmCG and expression analysis. Using ME-Class2 we analyze whole-genome single-base resolution 5mC and 5hmC datasets from 20 primary tissue and cell samples to uncover relationships between 5hmC and expression. The addition of 5hmC improves model performance for tissues with high-levels of 5hmC such as the brain. Our analysis further indicates that conversion of 5mC to 5hmC within 2kb of the transcription start site associates with distinct functions depending on the summed level of 5mC + 5hmC. Unchanged levels of 5mC + 5hmC (i.e. conversion from 5mC to stable 5hmC) associate with repression. Meanwhile, decreases in 5mC + 5hmC (i.e. 5hmC-mediated demethylation) associate with gene activation. As more large-scale, genome-wide, differential DNA methylation studies become available, tools such as ME-Class2 will prove invaluable to interpret epigenomic data and guide mechanistic studies into the function of 5hmC.</content></content><title>Integrative analysis of 5-methyl- and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine indicates a role for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine as a repressive epigenetic mark [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Schlosberg, C.

The cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) is implicated in neuroprotective signaling and neurotoxic pathways in both prion diseases and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (N-PrP) has been shown to interact with neurotoxic ligands, such as Aβ and Scrapie prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;), and to be crucial for the neuroprotective activity of PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;. To gain further insight into cellular pathways tied to PrP, we analyzed the brain interactome of N-PrP. As a novel approach employing recombinantly expressed PrP and intein-mediated protein ligation, we used N-PrP covalently coupled to beads as a bait for affinity purification. N-PrP beads were incubated with human AD or control brain lysates. N-PrP binding partners were then identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nano ESI-MS/MS). In addition to newly identified proteins we found many previously described PrP interactors, indicating a crucial role of the intrinsically disordered part of PrP in mediating protein interactions. Moreover, some interactors were found only in either non-AD or AD brain, suggesting aberrant PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; interactions in the pathogenesis of AD.</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197659</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Alterations in the brain interactome of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of the cellular prion protein (PrP&amp;lt;sup&gt;C&amp;lt;/sup&gt;) in Alzheimer’s disease</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah Ulbrich, Petra Janning, Ralf Seidel, Jakob Matschke, Anika Gonsberg, Sebastian Jung, Markus Glatzel, Martin Engelhard, Konstanze F.

The stolbur phytoplasma vector &lt;i&gt;Hyalesthes obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; is generally considered as a polyphagous species associated with numerous wild and cultivated plants. However, recent research in southeastern Europe, the distribution centre of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; and the area of most stolbur-inflicted crop diseases, points toward specific host-plant associations of the vector, indicating specific vector-based transmission routes. Here, we study the specificity of populations associated with four host-plants using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers, and we evaluate the evolution of host-shifts in &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt;. Host-plant use was confirmed for &lt;i&gt;Convolvulus arvensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Urtica dioica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vitex agnus-castus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Crepis foetida&lt;/i&gt;. Mitochondrial genetic analysis showed sympatric occurrence of three phylogenetic lineages that were ecologically delineated by host-plant preference, but were morphologically inseparable. Nuclear data supported the existence of three genetic groups (Evanno’s ΔK(3) = 803.72) with average genetic membership probabilities &gt; 90%.

The pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains unclear, but an imbalance between the production and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is known to play a critical role in AD progression. A promising preventative approach is to enhance the normal Aβ clearance activity of brain phagocytes such as microglia. In mice, the intraperitoneal injection of Toll-like receptor 4 agonist was shown to enhance Aβ clearance and exhibit a preventative effect on AD-related pathology. Our previous clinical study demonstrated that orally administered &lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&lt;/i&gt;-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPSp) exhibited an LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-lowering effect in human volunteers with hyperlipidemia, a known risk factor for AD. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies have shown that LPSp treatment increases Aβ phagocytosis by microglial cells; however it is still unclear whether orally administered LPSp exhibits a preventive effect on AD progression. We show here that in senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice fed a high-fat diet, oral administration of LPSp at 0.3 or 1 mg/kg body weight·day for 18 weeks significantly improved glucose metabolism and lipid profiles. The LPSp treatment also reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and oxidative-burst activity in the peripheral blood. Moreover, LPSp significantly reduced brain Aβ burden and memory impairment as seen in the water maze test, although we could not confirm a significant enhancement of Aβ phagocytosis in microglia isolated from the brains after treatment. Taken together, our results show that LPSp holds promise as a preventative therapy for AD or AD-related diseases induced by impairment of metabolic functions.</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198493</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Oral administration of &amp;lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&amp;lt;/i&gt;-derived lipopolysaccharide prevents metabolic dysfunction and Alzheimer’s disease-related memory loss in senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice fed a high-fat diet</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yutaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Inagawa, Chie Kohchi, Kimiko Kazumura, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Miwa, Katsuichiro Okazaki, Gen-Ichiro Soma&lt;/p&gt;

Thin-plate splines were used to visualize these differences, and clearly show the differences which are focused on the ambulacral region of the blastoids, which are the primary food gathering point for these species.</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Ryan FitzGerald Morgan</name></author><fingerprint>34bcf482</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197512</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197512</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>17</engagement><crawled>1526462284539</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163683e02fb:3f7c942:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25601-7</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slow touch targeting CT-fibres does not increase prosocial behaviour in economic laboratory tasks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow touch targeting CT-fibres does not increase prosocial behaviour in economic laboratory tasks, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25601-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25601-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Slow touch targeting CT-fibres does not increase prosocial behaviour in economic laboratory tasks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Yp6VSnlYSUM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526454000000</published><fingerprint>7703eda3</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25601-7</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slow touch targeting CT-fibres does not increase prosocial behaviour in economic laboratory tasks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow touch targeting CT-fibres does not increase prosocial behaviour in economic laboratory tasks, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25601-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25601-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Slow touch targeting CT-fibres does not increase prosocial behaviour in economic laboratory tasks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Yp6VSnlYSUM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Slow touch targeting CT-fibres does not increase prosocial behaviour in economic laboratory tasks</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25601-7/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25601_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><height>427</height></visual><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Lisa Anna Rosenberger</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25601-7</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/Yp6VSnlYSUM/s41598-018-25601-7</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526924658806</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16383cd4876:d8baf9:abeb7260</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006142</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew D.

Target selection is the first and pivotal step in drug discovery. An incorrect choice may not manifest itself for many years after hundreds of millions of research dollars have been spent. We collected a set of 332 targets that succeeded or failed in phase III clinical trials, and explored whether Omic features describing the target genes could predict clinical success. We obtained features from the recently published comprehensive resource: Harmonizome. Nineteen features appeared to be significantly correlated with phase III clinical trial outcomes, but only 4 passed validation schemes that used bootstrapping or modified permutation tests to assess feature robustness and generalizability while accounting for target class selection bias. We also used classifiers to perform multivariate feature selection and found that classifiers with a single feature performed as well in cross-validation as classifiers with more features (AUROC = 0.57 and AUPR = 0.81). The two predominantly selected features were mean mRNA expression across tissues and standard deviation of expression across tissues, where successful targets tended to have lower mean expression and higher expression variance than failed targets. This finding supports the conventional wisdom that it is favorable for a target to be present in the tissue(s) affected by a disease and absent from other tissues. Overall, our results suggest that it is feasible to construct a model integrating interpretable target features to inform target selection. We anticipate deeper insights and better models in the future, as researchers can reuse the data we have provided to improve methods for handling sample biases and learn more informative features.

Holahan, Xiaohai Wang, Jason M. Uslaner, Andrea K. Houghton, Jeffrey L. Evelhoch, Christopher T. Winkelmann, Catherine D. G. Hines&lt;/p&gt;
Studies in rodents show that olfactory processing in the principal neurons of olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex (PC) is controlled by local inhibitory interneurons, and glutamate NMDA receptor plays a role in this inhibitory control. It is not clear if findings from studies in rodents translate to olfactory processing in nonhuman primates (NHPs). In this study, the effect of the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 on odorant-induced olfactory responses in the OB and PC of anesthetized NHPs (rhesus monkeys) was investigated by cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI. Isoamyl-acetate was used as the odor stimulant. For each NHP, sixty fMRI measurements were made during a 4-h period, with each 4-min measurement consisting of a 1-min baseline period, a 1-min odor stimulation period, and a 2-min recovery period. MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) was intravenously delivered 1 hour after starting fMRI. Before MK801 injection, olfactory fMRI activations were observed only in the OB, not in the PC. After MK801 injection, olfactory fMRI activations in the OB increased, and robust olfactory fMRI activations were observed in the PC.

Studies in rodents show that olfactory processing in the principal neurons of olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex (PC) is controlled by local inhibitory interneurons, and glutamate NMDA receptor plays a role in this inhibitory control. It is not clear if findings from studies in rodents translate to olfactory processing in nonhuman primates (NHPs). In this study, the effect of the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 on odorant-induced olfactory responses in the OB and PC of anesthetized NHPs (rhesus monkeys) was investigated by cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI. Isoamyl-acetate was used as the odor stimulant. For each NHP, sixty fMRI measurements were made during a 4-h period, with each 4-min measurement consisting of a 1-min baseline period, a 1-min odor stimulation period, and a 2-min recovery period. MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) was intravenously delivered 1 hour after starting fMRI. Before MK801 injection, olfactory fMRI activations were observed only in the OB, not in the PC. After MK801 injection, olfactory fMRI activations in the OB increased, and robust olfactory fMRI activations were observed in the PC. The data indicate that MK801 enhances the olfactory responses in both the OB and PC. The enhancement effects of MK801 are most likely from its blockage of NMDA receptors on local inhibitory interneurons and the attenuation of the inhibition onto principal neurons. This study suggests that the mechanism of local inhibitory control of principal neurons in the OB and PC derived from studies in rodents translates to NHPs.</content></content><updated>1528232400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Fuqiang Zhao</name></author><fingerprint>d1c8b83f</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198395</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198395</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00102/20180516/images/medium/ct-2018-001023_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00102&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is one of the most common chronic metabolic diseases, but detection and treatment rates are low. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the correlation between frontal skull Hounsfield unit (HU) values from brain computed tomography (CT) scans and T-scores of the lumbar spine and femoral neck from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients with &amp;lt; 1 year between brain CT and DXA scans were included in the study. The average frontal skull HU value used for analysis was defined as the average of four HU values of the frontal bone. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated, and area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the HU values of the frontal skull for predicting osteoporosis. The frontal skull HU value with the highest sensitivity and specificity was considered the optimal cutoff value.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 899 patients who underwent both brain CT and DXA scans at a single institution were enrolled. Average skull HU values differed significantly among patients in different bone mineral density categories (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).

We performed high-throughput drug screening of epigenetic-targeted therapies across a large and diverse tumor cell line panel and uncovered the hypersensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to GSK-J4, a small-molecule dual inhibitor of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27) demethylases ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome (UTX), and histone demethylase Jumonji D3 (JMJD3). Mechanistically, GSK-J4 induced neuroblastoma differentiation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, with accompanying up-regulation of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and induction of cell death.

We performed high-throughput drug screening of epigenetic-targeted therapies across a large and diverse tumor cell line panel and uncovered the hypersensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to GSK-J4, a small-molecule dual inhibitor of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27) demethylases ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome (UTX), and histone demethylase Jumonji D3 (JMJD3). Mechanistically, GSK-J4 induced neuroblastoma differentiation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, with accompanying up-regulation of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and induction of cell death.

Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt;, currently affecting more than 200 million people. Among the various species of this parasite that infect humans, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; is the most common. Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study, we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this, we investigated systemic acute toxicity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice. Treated mice showed no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or histological parameters compared to non-treated animals. Epiisopilosine showed potential as a schistosomicidal drug: it did not cause acute toxicity and it displayed an acceptable safety profile in the animal model.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196667</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Epiisopilosine alkaloid has activity against &amp;lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&amp;lt;/i&gt; in mice without acute toxicity</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria A.

The search for general properties in network structure has been a central issue for food web studies in recent years. One such property is the small-world topology that combines a high clustering and a small distance between nodes of the network. This property may increase food web resilience but make them more sensitive to the extinction of connected species. Food web theory has been developed principally from freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, largely omitting marine habitats. If theory needs to be modified to accommodate observations from marine ecosystems, based on major differences in several topological characteristics is still on debate. Here we investigated if the small-world topology is a common structural pattern in marine food webs. We developed a novel, simple and statistically rigorous method to examine the largest set of complex marine food webs to date. More than half of the analyzed marine networks exhibited a similar or lower characteristic path length than the random expectation, whereas 39% of the webs presented a significantly higher clustering than its random counterpart. Our method proved that 5 out of 28 networks fulfilled both features of the small-world topology: short path length and high clustering. This work represents the first rigorous analysis of the small-world topology and its associated features in high-quality marine networks. We conclude that such topology is a structural pattern that is not maximized in marine food webs; thus it is probably not an effective model to study robustness, stability and feasibility of marine ecosystems.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198217</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Architecture of marine food webs: To be or not be a ‘small-world’</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomás Ignacio Marina, Leonardo A.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the detrimental effects of intramedullary reaming used in conventional TKA for distal femur cutting are of concern. Avoiding intramedullary reaming with the use of computer-assisted navigation TKA can not only provide superior prosthetic alignment, but also mitigate perioperative blood loss and the dissipation of marrow emboli. We quantified local and systemic concentrations of inflammation markers for both techniques. Forty-four participants undergoing computer-assisted navigation and 53 receiving conventional TKA for advanced knee OA were recruited between 2013/02/08 and 2015/12/09. Blood samples were collected from all participants at baseline then again at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed by ELISA for interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1); these markers were also measured in Hemovac drain fluid collected at 24 and 72 hours. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β1(unit for all markers: pg/mL) were increased from baseline by smaller increments in the navigation TKA cohort compared with the conventional TKA group at 24 hours (17.06 vs 29.39, p = 0.02; 0.51 vs 0.83, p = 0.16; –0.04 vs 0.36, p &amp;lt; 0.01 and –48.18 vs 63.24, p&amp;lt; 0.01, respectively) and at 72 hours (12.27 vs 16.87, p = 0.01; –0.40 vs 0.48, p &amp;lt; 0.01; 0.58 vs 0.98, p = 0.07 and –55.16 vs 63.71, p &amp;lt; 0.01, respectively). IL-10 levels in drainage fluids collected 24 hours after TKA were also significantly lower in the navigation group versus the conventional TKA group (8.55 vs 12.32, p &amp;lt; 0.01). According to our evidence, the merits of computer-assisted navigation TKA are augmented by low levels of inflammation markers.</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197097</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Effects of computer-assisted navigation versus conventional total knee arthroplasty on the levels of inflammation markers: A prospective study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shu-Jui Kuo, Horng-Chaung Hsu, Ching-Jen Wang, Ka-Kit Siu, Ya-Hung Hsu, Jih-Yang Ko, Chih-Hsin Tang&lt;/p&gt;

According to our evidence, the merits of computer-assisted navigation TKA are augmented by low levels of inflammation markers.</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Shu-Jui Kuo</name></author><fingerprint>cdd4764d</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197097</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197097</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525943388898</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16349504ae2:11dfaa6:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04162-3</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explaining the apparent impenetrable barrier to ultra-relativistic electrons in the outer Van Allen belt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining the apparent impenetrable barrier to ultra-relativistic electrons in the outer Van Allen belt, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04162-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04162-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The origin of the apparent impenetrable barrier in the outer Van Allen belt is still uncertain.
