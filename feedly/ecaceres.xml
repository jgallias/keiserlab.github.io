A number of different genetics-based vector control methods have been proposed. Two approaches currently under development in &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes are the two-locus engineered underdominance and killer-rescue gene drive systems. Each of these is theoretically capable of increasing in frequency within a population, thus spreading associated desirable genetic traits. Thus they have gained attention for their potential to aid in the fight against various mosquito-vectored diseases. In the case of engineered underdominance, introduced transgenes are theoretically capable of persisting indefinitely (i.e. it is self-sustaining) whilst in the killer-rescue system the rescue component should initially increase in frequency (while the lethal component (killer) is common) before eventually declining (when the killer is rare) and being eliminated (i.e. it is temporally self-limiting). The population genetics of both systems have been explored using discrete generation mathematical models. The effects of various ecological factors on these two systems have also been considered using alternative modelling methodologies. Here we formulate and analyse new mathematical models combining the population dynamics and population genetics of these two classes of gene drive that incorporate ecological factors not previously studied and are simple enough to allow the effects of each to be disentangled. In particular, we focus on the potential effects that may be obtained as a result of differing ecological factors such as strengths of larval competition; numbers of breeding sites; and the relative fitness of transgenic mosquitoes compared with their wild-type counterparts. We also extend our models to consider population dynamics in two demes in order to explore the effects of dispersal between neighbouring populations on the outcome of UD and KR gene drive systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3QzCHPdoiAg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b57739f6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew P.

In face-to-face social interactions, blind and visually impaired persons (VIPs) lack access to nonverbal cues like facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, which may lead to impaired interpersonal communication. In this study, a wearable sensory substitution device (SSD) consisting of a head mounted camera and a haptic belt was evaluated to determine whether vibrotactile cues around the waist could be used to convey facial expressions to users and whether such a device is desired by VIPs for use in daily living situations. Ten VIPs (mean age: 38.8, SD: 14.4) and 10 sighted persons (SPs) (mean age: 44.5, SD: 19.6) participated in the study, in which validated sets of pictures, silent videos, and videos with audio of facial expressions were presented to the participant. A control measurement was first performed to determine how accurately participants could identify facial expressions while relying on their functional senses. After a short training, participants were asked to determine facial expressions while wearing the emotion feedback system. VIPs using the device showed significant improvements in their ability to determine which facial expressions were shown. A significant increase in accuracy of 44.4% was found across all types of stimuli when comparing the scores of the control (mean±SEM: 35.0±2.5%) and supported (mean±SEM: 79.4±2.1%) phases. The greatest improvements achieved with the support of the SSD were found for silent stimuli (68.3% for pictures and 50.8% for silent videos). SPs also showed consistent, though not statistically significant, improvements while supported. Overall, our study shows that vibrotactile cues are well suited to convey facial expressions to VIPs in real-time. Participants became skilled with the device after a short training session. Further testing and development of the SSD is required to improve its accuracy and aesthetics for potential daily use.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c0ef7590</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hendrik P.

Further testing and development of the SSD is required to improve its accuracy and aesthetics for potential daily use.</description><title>Conveying facial expressions to blind and visually impaired persons through a wearable vibrotactile device</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f09:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194737</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194737</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522184400000</published><author><name>Hendrik P.

Higher trophic-level species are an integral component of any marine ecosystem. Despite their importance, methods for representing these species in end-to-end ecosystem models often have limited representation of life histories, energetics and behaviour. We built an individual-based model coupled with a dynamic energy budget for female southern elephant seals &lt;i&gt;Mirounga leonina&lt;/i&gt; to demonstrate a method for detailed representation of marine mammals. We aimed to develop a model which could i) simulate energy use and life histories, as well as breeding traits of southern elephant seals in an emergent manner, ii) project a stable population over time, and iii) have realistic population dynamics and structure based on emergent life history features (such as age at first breeding, lifespan, fecundity and (yearling) survival). We evaluated the model’s ability to represent a stable population over long time periods (&gt;10 generations), including the sensitivity of the emergent properties to variations in key parameters. Analyses indicated that the model is sensitive to changes in resource availability and energy requirements for the transition from pup to juvenile, and juvenile to adult stage. This was particularly the case for breeding success and yearling survival. This model is suitable for use as a standalone tool for investigating the impacts of changes to behaviour and population responses of southern elephant seals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>578556a2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Merel Goedegebuure, Jessica Melbourne-Thomas, Stuart P.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) affects besides muscle also the brain, resulting in memory and behavioral problems. The consequences of dystrophinopathy on gross macroscopic alterations are unclear. To elucidate the effect of full-length dystrophin expression on brain morphology, we used high-resolution post-mortem MRI in mouse models that either express 0% (&lt;i&gt;mdx&lt;/i&gt;), 100% (BL10) or a low amount of full-length dystrophin (&lt;i&gt;mdx&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;Xist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Δhs&lt;/sup&gt;). While absence or low amounts of full-length dystrophin did not significantly affect whole brain volume and skull morphology, we found differences in volume of individual brain structures. The results are in line with observations in humans, where whole brain volume was found to be reduced only in patients lacking both full-length dystrophin and the shorter isoform Dp140.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5b78a78f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bauke Kogelman, Artem Khmelinskii, Ingrid Verhaart, Laura van Vliet, Diewertje I.

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous deletion of 26–28 genes at chromosome band 7q11.23. The complete deletion (CD) mouse model mimics the most common deletion found in WBS patients and recapitulates most neurologic features of the disorder along with some cardiovascular manifestations leading to significant cardiac hypertrophy with increased cardiomyocytes’ size. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin found in green tea, has been associated with potential health benefits, both on cognition and cardiovascular phenotypes, through several mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the effects of green tea extracts on WBS-related phenotypes through a phase I clinical trial in mice. After feeding CD animals with green tea extracts dissolved in the drinking water, starting at three different time periods (prenatal, youth and adulthood), a set of behavioral tests and several anatomical, histological and molecular analyses were performed. Treatment resulted to be effective in the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and was also able to ameliorate short-term memory deficits of CD mice. Taken together, these results suggest that EGCG might have a therapeutic and/or preventive role in the management of WBS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b6faf5d3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paula Ortiz-Romero, Cristina Borralleras, Mònica Bosch-Morató, Biuse Guivernau, Guillermo Albericio, Francisco J.

Bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality with rates varying from 10–25% and higher. Appropriate and timely onset of antibiotic therapy influences the prognosis of these patients. It requires the diagnostic accuracy which is not afforded by current gold standards such as blood culture. Moreover, the time from blood sampling to blood culture results is a key determinant of reducing mortality. No established biomarkers exist which can differentiate bloodstream infections from other systemic inflammatory conditions. This calls for studies on biomarkers potential of molecular profiling of plasma as it is affected most by the molecular changes accompanying bloodstream infections. N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification which is very sensitive to changes in physiology. Here we have performed targeted quantitative N-glycoproteomics from plasma samples of patients with confirmed positive blood culture together with age and sex matched febrile controls with negative blood culture reports. Three hundred and sixty eight potential N-glycopeptides were quantified by mass spectrometry and 149 were further selected for identification. Twenty four N-glycopeptides were identified with high confidence together with elucidation of the peptide sequence, N-glycosylation site, glycan composition and proposed glycan structures. Principal component analysis, orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (S-Plot) and self-organizing maps clustering among other statistical methods were employed to analyze the data. These methods gave us clear separation of the two patient classes. We propose high-confidence N-glycopeptides which have the power to separate the bloodstream infections from blood culture negative febrile patients and shed light on host response during bacteremia. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD009048.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>1416d9ae</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sakari Joenvaara, Mayank Saraswat, Pentti Kuusela, Shruti Saraswat, Rahul Agarwal, Johanna Kaartinen, Asko Järvinen, Risto Renkonen&lt;/p&gt;

BFF uses a flexible underlying model that combines classical statistical tests with Big Data machine-learning strategies. The model is created using thousands of biological characteristics (features) that are used to build a feature map and interpret category labels in genomic ranges.

BFF uses a flexible underlying model that combines classical statistical tests with Big Data machine-learning strategies. The model is created using thousands of biological characteristics (features) that are used to build a feature map and interpret category labels in genomic ranges.

Plant-growth promotion has been linked to the &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; genus since the beginning of this research field. In this work, we mined the genome of an Argentinean isolate of the recently described species &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;donghuensis&lt;/i&gt;. Strain SVBP6, isolated from bulk soil of an agricultural plot, showed a broad antifungal activity and several other plant-probiotic activities. As this species has been recently described, and it seems like some plant-growth promoting (PGP) traits do not belong to the classical pseudomonads toolbox, we decide to explore the SVBP6 genome via an bioinformatic approach. Genome inspection confirmed our previous &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; results about genes involved in several probiotic activities. Other genetic traits possibly involved in survival of SVBP6 in highly competitive environments, such as rhizospheres, were found. Tn&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt; mutagenesis revealed that the antifungal activity against the soil pathogen &lt;i&gt;Macrophomina phaseolina&lt;/i&gt; was dependent on a functional &lt;i&gt;gacS&lt;/i&gt; gene, from the regulatory cascade Gac-Rsm, but it was not due to volatile compounds. Altogether, our genomic analyses and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; tests allowed the phylogenetic assignment and provided the first insights into probiotic properties of the first &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;donghuensis&lt;/i&gt; isolate from the Americas.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ac32692d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Betina Cecilia Agaras, Andrés Iriarte, Claudio Fabián Valverde&lt;/p&gt;

The waste of commonly used medicines is known to contaminate freshwater ecosystems. Pharmaceuticals can be toxic, mutagenic, or modifying to freshwater organisms even at low concentrations if consider their permanent presence in the environment. Chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer, and in particular alkylating agents, contribute significantly to this form of pollution, the latter introducing cytotoxic and/or mutagenic lesions to the DNA and RNA of organisms which can be disruptive to their cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide (CP) on &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt; clones. We evaluated the life history parameters and protein profiles of this crustacean following exposure to environmentally relevant CP concentration of 10 ng L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Even at this low concentration, the alkylating agent caused modification of the life history parameters and proteome profile of the &lt;i&gt;Daphnia&lt;/i&gt;. These changes were clone-specific and involved growth rate, age at first reproduction, neonate number, and proteins related to cell cycle and redox state regulation. The disturbance caused by pharmaceuticals contaminating freshwater ecosystem is probably weaker and unlikely to be cytotoxic in character due to the high dilution of these substances in the water. However, our results indicate that prolonged exposure of organisms to these toxins may lead to modifications on the organismal and molecular levels with unpredictable significance for the entire ecosystem.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d431fe05</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Grzesiuk, Damian Mielecki, Tomasz Pilżys, Damian Garbicz, Michał Marcinkowski, Elżbieta Grzesiuk&lt;/p&gt;

However, our results indicate that prolonged exposure of organisms to these toxins may lead to modifications on the organismal and molecular levels with unpredictable significance for the entire ecosystem.</description><title>How cyclophosphamide at environmentally relevant concentration influences &amp;lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&amp;lt;/i&gt; life history and its proteome</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4618:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195366</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195366</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522962000000</published><author><name>Małgorzata Grzesiuk</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522950125206</crawled></item><item><engagement>6</engagement><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005473</originId><updated>1522962000000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas Ariotti, James Rae, Nichole Giles, Nick Martel, Emma Sierecki, Yann Gambin, Thomas E.

We describe the development and application of a suite of modular tools for high-resolution detection of proteins and intracellular protein complexes by electron microscopy (EM). Conditionally stable GFP- and mCherry-binding nanobodies (termed csGBP and csChBP, respectively) are characterized using a cell-free expression and analysis system and subsequently fused to an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) enzyme. Expression of these cassettes alongside fluorescently labelled proteins results in recruitment and stabilisation of APEX, whereas unbound APEX nanobodies are efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This greatly simplifies correlative analyses, enables detection of less-abundant proteins, and eliminates the need to balance expression levels between fluorescently labelled and APEX nanobody proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system to bimolecular complementation (‘EM split-fluorescent protein’), for localisation of protein–protein interactions at the ultrastructural level.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrmHIECypRw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9519aa11</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas Ariotti, James Rae, Nichole Giles, Nick Martel, Emma Sierecki, Yann Gambin, Thomas E.

The general question by what mechanism an “effector” molecule and the hemes of hemoglobin interact over widely separated intramolecular distances to change the oxygen affinity has been extensively investigated, and still has remained of central interest. In the present work we were interested in clarifying the general role of the protein matrix and its dynamics in the regulation of human adult hemoglobin (HbA). We used a spectroscopy approach that yields the compressibility (&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;) of the protein matrix around the hemes of the subunits in HbA and studied how the binding of heterotropic allosteric effectors modify this parameter. &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; is directly related to the variance of volume fluctuation, therefore it characterizes the molecular dynamics of the protein structure. For the experiments the heme groups either in the α or in the β subunits of HbA were replaced by fluorescent Zn-protoporphyrinIX, and series of fluorescence line narrowed spectra were measured at varied pressures. The evaluation of the spectra yielded the compressibility that showed significant dynamic asymmetry between the subunits: &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunit was 0.17±0.05/GPa, while for the β subunit it was much higher, 0.36±0.07/GPa. The heterotropic effectors, chloride ions, inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate did not cause significant changes in &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunits, while in the β subunits the effectors lead to a significant reduction down to 0.15±0.04/GPa. We relate our results to structural data, to results of recent functional studies and to those of molecular dynamics simulations, and find good agreements. The observed asymmetry in the flexibility suggests a distinct role of the subunits in the regulation of Hb that results in the observed changes of the oxygen binding capability.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2b113486</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gusztáv Schay, András D.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition driven by loss of homeostasis between the mucosal immune system, the commensal gut microbiota, and the intestinal epithelium. Our goal is to understand how these components of the intestinal ecosystem cooperate to control homeostasis. By combining quantitative measures of epithelial hyperplasia and immune infiltration with multivariate analysis of inter- and intracellular signaling, we identified epithelial mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling as a potential driver of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis. A kinetic analysis of mTOR inhibition revealed that the pathway regulates epithelial differentiation, which in turn controls the cytokine milieu of the colon. Consistent with our in vivo analysis, we found that cytokine expression of organoids grown ex vivo, in the absence of bacteria and immune cells, was dependent on differentiation state. Our study suggests that proper differentiation of epithelial cells is an important feature of colonic homeostasis because of its effect on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZpVf1yiGbfQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2d344ab2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jesse Lyons, Phaedra C.

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common disease of cattle and wildlife, with economic repercussions and implications for animal and human health. The surveillance of bTB in wildlife is particularly important, to shed light on the epidemiological role of wild species and for the adaptation of control measures. In France, a bTB surveillance system for free-ranging wildlife, the Sylvatub system, was launched in 2011 on wild boars, red deer, roe deer and badgers. It relies on active and passive surveillance activities, constrained by practical difficulties, such as the accessibility of wild animals, and regulatory rules for the trapping of badgers, for example. We report here the first assessment of stakeholders’ perceptions of the Sylvatub system and its acceptability, based on 20 individual semi-structured interviews with three types of stakeholder (collectors, coordinators, officers) in areas with different rates of bTB infection. With the caveat that these findings cannot be assumed to be representative of the national situation, we found that the Sylvatub system was considered useful by all the stakeholders interviewed. Those from the world of hunting participate in surveillance mostly to help livestock farmers, who are not systematically involved in bTB surveillance in wildlife.

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common disease of cattle and wildlife, with economic repercussions and implications for animal and human health. The surveillance of bTB in wildlife is particularly important, to shed light on the epidemiological role of wild species and for the adaptation of control measures. In France, a bTB surveillance system for free-ranging wildlife, the Sylvatub system, was launched in 2011 on wild boars, red deer, roe deer and badgers. It relies on active and passive surveillance activities, constrained by practical difficulties, such as the accessibility of wild animals, and regulatory rules for the trapping of badgers, for example. We report here the first assessment of stakeholders’ perceptions of the Sylvatub system and its acceptability, based on 20 individual semi-structured interviews with three types of stakeholder (collectors, coordinators, officers) in areas with different rates of bTB infection. With the caveat that these findings cannot be assumed to be representative of the national situation, we found that the Sylvatub system was considered useful by all the stakeholders interviewed. Those from the world of hunting participate in surveillance mostly to help livestock farmers, who are not systematically involved in bTB surveillance in wildlife. Many practical and regulatory constraints were raised, which could be offset by recognition of the work done by the “hunting community”, to maintain the willingness of these individuals to participate. We also identified a need for improvements in communication and information. Qualitative information, such as that collected here, is essential to improve our understanding of the reasons favoring and disfavoring participation in surveillance, and should be taken into account in the evaluation process. These results are relevant to hunters and to veterinary authorities wishing to identify the determinants of participation in the Sylvatub system. They could provide support for decision-making processes to improve surveillance strategies.</description><title>Perceptions and acceptability of some stakeholders about the bovine tuberculosis surveillance system for wildlife (Sylvatub) in France</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a621:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194447</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194447</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521147600000</published><author><name>Julie Rivière</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521136812725</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194953</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194953</originId><updated>1521752400000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Melania Melis, Mariano Mastinu, Massimiliano Arca, Roberto Crnjar, Iole Tomassini Barbarossa&lt;/p&gt;
Oral sensitivity to fats varies in individuals influencing nutritional status and health. Variations in oleic acid perception are associated with &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt; and odorant binding protein (&lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&lt;/i&gt;) polymorphisms, and 6-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-propylthiouracil (PROP) sensitivity, which is mediated by TAS2R38 receptor. L-Arginine (L-Arg) supplementation was shown to modify the perception of the five taste qualities. Here we analyzed the effect of three concentrations (5, 10, 15 mmol/L) of L-Arg on oral perception of oleic acid in forty-six subjects classified for PROP taster status and genotyped for &lt;i&gt;TAS2R38&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms. L-Arg supplementation was effective in increasing the perceived intensity of oleic acid in most subjects. The lowest concentration was the most effective, especially in PROP non-tasters or medium tasters, and in subjects with at least an allele A in &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&lt;/i&gt; loci. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were exploited to characterize the chemical interaction between L-Arg and oleic acid, showing that a stable 1:1 oleate·ArgH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; adduct can be formed, stabilized by a pair of hydrogen bonds. Results indicate that L-Arg, acting as a ‘carrier’ of fatty acids in saliva, can selectively modify taste response, and suggest that it may to be used in personalized dietetic strategies to optimize eating behaviors and health.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>81f13ac0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Melania Melis, Mariano Mastinu, Massimiliano Arca, Roberto Crnjar, Iole Tomassini Barbarossa&lt;/p&gt;

Individuals with disabilities are regarded as a highly vulnerable population group, particularly as far as oral health is concern. However, few studies have assessed the impact of the oral condition on the quality of life of these individuals. Therefore, the aim of this study is to expand knowledge on the oral health status of the Portuguese adults with mild intellectual disability, and to assess how the patient’s oral health is related to their quality of life. A sample of 240 adults with mild intellectual disabilities linked to the Portuguese Federation for Intellectual Disability, were interviewed using a previously validated version of the Oral Health Impact Profile. An oral health examination was also conducted using three oral health indexes: Clinical Oral Health Index (COHI); Clinical Oral Care Needs Index (COCNI) and the Clinical Oral Prevention Index (COPI). Sociodemographic characteristics and dental health factors were also collected, following statistical analysis. More than half of the individuals (54,9%) presented one or more problems of major to severe impact on health (COHI level 2); only 4,6% of the individuals do not need treatment or examination (COCNI level 0) and 85% of the study sample needs measures of educational or preventive action (COPI level 1). In 76,9% of the participants, oral health had impact on the quality of life. The most affected dimensions of life were physical pain with 61,9%, followed by psychological discomfort and psychological disability with 45,1% and 45%, respectively. With relation to oral health factors and sociodemographic variables it was verified that fewer teeth and higher self-perception of need for dental treatment had a negative impact on the quality of life. On the other hand, institutionalization and an increase in at least one category in the self-perception of the oral health status had a positive impact on the quality of life. Given the high burden of oral disease and the considerable impact on quality of life found in this study, the establishment of guidelines to improve the oral health and quality of life of these individuals should be regarded as imperative.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a1b36a86</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Patrícia Couto, Paulo Almeida Pereira, Manuel Nunes, Rui Amaral Mendes&lt;/p&gt;

Deep sequencing of small RNAs (sRNAs) in developing male strobili of second-generation offspring originating from a nuclear genic male sterile tree of &lt;i&gt;Cryptomeria japonica&lt;/i&gt; were performed to characterize sRNA populations in the male strobili at early pollen developmental stages. Comparing to sequences of microRNA (miRNA) families of plant species and sRNAs expressed in the reproductive organs of representative vascular plants, 37 conserved miRNA families were detected, of which eight were ubiquitously expressed in the reproductive organs of land plant species. In contrast, miR1083 was common in male reproductive organs of gymnosperm species but absent in angiosperm species. In addition to conserved miRNAs, 199 novel miRNAs candidates were predicted. The expression patterns of the obtained sRNAs were further investigated to detect the differentially expressed (DE) sRNAs between genic male sterile and fertile individuals. A total of 969 DE sRNAs were obtained and only three known miRNA families were included among them.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. An important step in the shift to a pro-cancerous microenvironment is the transformation of normal stromal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are present in a majority of solid tumors and can directly promote tumor cell motility via cytokine, chemokine and growth factor secretion into the TME. The exact effects that the TME has upon cytoskeletal regulation in motile tumor cells remain enigmatic. The conserved formin family of cytoskeleton regulating proteins plays an essential role in the assembly and/or bundling of unbranched actin filaments. Mammalian Diaphanous-related formin 2 (mDia2/DIAPH3/Drf3/Dia) assembles a dynamic F-actin cytoskeleton that underlies tumor cell migration and invasion. We therefore sought to understand whether CAF-derived chemokines impact breast tumor cell motility through modification of the formin-assembled F-actin cytoskeleton. In MDA-MB-231 cells, conditioned media (CM) from WS19T CAFs, a human breast tumor-adjacent CAF line, significantly and robustly increased wound closure and invasion relative to normal human mammary fibroblast (HMF)-CM. WS19T-CM also promoted proteasome-mediated mDia2 degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells relative to control HMF-CM and WS21T CAF-CM, a breast CAF cell line that failed to promote robust MDA-MB-231 migration. Cytokine array analysis of CM identified up-regulated secreted factors in WS19T relative to control WS21T CM. We identified CXCL12 as a CM factor influencing loss of mDia2 protein while increasing MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Our data suggest a mechanism whereby CAFs promote tumor cell migration and invasion through CXCL12 secretion to regulate the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton in breast tumor cells.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8ed0de76</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kaitlyn M.

Our data suggest a mechanism whereby CAFs promote tumor cell migration and invasion through CXCL12 secretion to regulate the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton in breast tumor cells.</description><title>Carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote breast cancer motility by suppressing mammalian Diaphanous-related formin-2 (mDia2)</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde33:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195278</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195278</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522357200000</published><author><name>Kaitlyn M.

This paper presents a switching PD-based sliding mode control (PD-SMC) method for the 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) hovering motion of the underwater robot with tilting thrusters. Four thrusters of robot can be tilted simultaneously in the horizontal and vertical directions, and the 6-DOF motion is achieved by switching between two thruster configurations. Therefore, the tilting speed of thruster becomes the most essential parameter to determine the stability of hovering motion. Even though the previous PD control ensures stable hovering motion within a certain ranges of tilting speed, a PD-SMC is suggested in this paper by combining PD control with sliding mode control in order to achieve acceptable hovering performance even at the much lower tilting speeds. Also, the sign function in the sliding mode control is replaced by a sigmoid function to reduce undesired chattering. Simulations show that while PD control is effective only for tilting duration of 600 ms, the PD-based sliding mode control can guarantee the stable hovering motion of underwater robot even for the tilting duration of up to 1500 ms. Extensive experimental results confirm the hovering performance of the proposed PD-SMC method is much superior to that of PD method for much larger tilting durations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4a9382e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sangrok Jin, Jeongae Bak, Jongwon Kim, TaeWon Seo, Hwa Soo Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Cerium (Ce) belongs to the rare earth elements (REEs), and although it is not essential for plants, it can stimulate growth and other physiological processes. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of Ce on seed germination, initial seedling growth, and vegetative growth in rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) cv. Morelos A-98. During the germination process, the seeds were treated with Ce concentrations of 0, 4, 8, and 12 μM; after 5 d, germination percentage was recorded and after 10 d seedling growth was measured. For vegetative growth, a hydroponic system was established where 14-d-old plants without previous Ce treatment were transferred into nutrient solution. After two weeks of acclimatizing, 0, 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce were added to the nutrient solution for 28 d. Ce significantly increased germination and the initial growth variables of the seedlings. During vegetative growth, Ce increased plant height, number of tillers, root volume, and shoot fresh and dry biomass, without affecting root biomass weight. With low Ce concentrations (25 and 50 μM), the concentrations of chlorophylls and amino acids in the shoots were similar to those in the control, like amino acid concentration in the roots at a concentration of 25 μM Ce. Conversely, the concentration of total sugars increased in the shoot with the application of 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce, and in the roots with the application of 50 μM Ce. Also, Ce did not affect the concentration of macro or micronutrients in the shoots. However, in the roots, the high Ce concentration decreased the concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mn, and Zn, while the Mg concentration increased. Our results indicate that Ce, at the right concentrations, can function as a biostimulant in rice germination and growth.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>97c046b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Monzerrat Ramírez-Olvera, Libia Iris Trejo-Téllez, Soledad García-Morales, Juan Antonio Pérez-Sato, Fernando Carlos Gómez-Merino&lt;/p&gt;

Collectively, our data indicate that obesity fuels BC resistance to anti-VEGF therapy via the production of inflammatory and angiogenic factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>[Research Articles] Obesity promotes resistance to anti-VEGF therapy in breast cancer by up-regulating IL-6 and potentially FGF-2</title><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_16225b7d257:4f153e:34f43e70</id><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/432/eaag0945?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/432/eaag0945?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1521049817000</published><author><name>Incio, J., Ligibel, J.

Deciphering a function of a given protein requires investigating various biological aspects. Usually, the protein of interest is expressed with a fusion tag that aids or allows subsequent analyses. Additionally, downregulation or inactivation of the studied gene enables functional studies. Development of the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology opened many possibilities but in many cases it is restricted to non-essential genes. Recombinase-dependent gene integration methods, like the Flp-In system, are very good alternatives. The system is widely used in different research areas, which calls for the existence of compatible vectors and efficient protocols that ensure straightforward DNA cloning and generation of stable cell lines. We have created and validated a robust series of 52 vectors for streamlined generation of stable mammalian cell lines using the FLP recombinase-based methodology. Using the sequence-independent DNA cloning method all constructs for a given coding-sequence can be made with just three universal PCR primers. Our collection allows tetracycline-inducible expression of proteins with various tags suitable for protein localization, FRET, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), protein dynamics studies (FRAP), co-immunoprecipitation, the RNA tethering assay and cell sorting. Some of the vectors contain a bidirectional promoter for concomitant expression of miRNA and mRNA, so that a gene can be silenced and its product replaced by a mutated miRNA-insensitive version. Our toolkit and protocols have allowed us to create more than 500 constructs with ease. We demonstrate the efficacy of our vectors by creating stable cell lines with various tagged proteins (numatrin, fibrillarin, coilin, centrin, THOC5, PCNA). We have analysed transgene expression over time to provide a guideline for future experiments and compared the effectiveness of commonly used inducers for tetracycline-responsive promoters. As proof of concept we examined the role of the exoribonuclease XRN2 in transcription termination by RNAseq.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f6d0d0c8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roman J.

Antithyroid drugs are generally selected as the first-line treatment for Graves’ Disease (GD); however, the existence of patients showing resistance or severe side effects to these drugs is an important issue to be solved. The (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] is a multi-functional protein that activates the tissue renin-angiotensin system and is an essential constituent of vacuolar H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase, necessary for the autophagy-lysosome pathway. (P)RR is cleaved to soluble (s)(P)RR, which reflects the status of (P)RR expression. In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate whether serum s(P)RR concentration can be used as a biomarker to predict the outcome of antithyroid drug treatment in GD patients. Serum s(P)RR levels were measured in 54 untreated GD patients and 47 control participants. Effects of medical treatment with antithyroid drugs on these levels were investigated in GD patients. Serum s(P)RR levels were significantly higher in patients with Graves’ disease than in control subjects (P&amp;lt;0.005) and were significantly reduced after medical treatment for Graves’ disease. High serum s(P)RR levels were associated with resistance to antithyroid drug treatment, suggesting that serum s(P)RR concentration can be used as a useful biomarker to predict the outcome of antithyroid drug treatment in these patients. Patients with Graves’ disease with low body mass index showed higher levels of serum soluble (pro)renin receptor levels than those with high body mass index. In addition, in patients with Graves’ disease, serum triglyceride levels were negatively correlated with serum soluble (pro)renin receptor levels. All these data indicated an association between low nutrient condition due to hyperthyroidism and increased (pro)renin receptor expression in these patients, suggesting that (pro)renin receptor expression could be increased in the process of stimulating intracellular energy production via activating autophagy function to compensate energy loss.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>59d0f88f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Mizuguchi, Satoshi Morimoto, Shihori Kimura, Noriyoshi Takano, Kaoru Yamashita, Yasufumi Seki, Kanako Bokuda, Midori Yatabe, Junichi Yatabe, Daisuke Watanabe, Takashi Ando, Atsuhiro Ichihara&lt;/p&gt;

The poorly understood mechanisms of dry season persistence of &lt;i&gt;Anopheles&lt;/i&gt; spp. mosquitoes through the dry season in Africa remain a critical gap in our knowledge of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; disease transmission. While it is thought that adult mosquitoes remain in a dormant state throughout this seven-month dry season, the nature of this state remains unknown and has largely not been recapitulated in laboratory settings. To elucidate possible connections of this state with microbial composition, the whole body microbiomes of adult mosquitoes in the dry and wet seasons in two locations of Mali with varying water availability were compared by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. These locations were a village near the Niger River with year-round water sources (N’Gabakoro, “riparian”), and a typical Sahelian area with highly seasonal breeding sites (Thierola Area, “Sahelian”). The 16S bacterial data consisted of 2057 sequence variants in 426 genera across 184 families. From these data, we found several compositional differences that were seasonally and spatially linked. Counter to our initial hypothesis, there were more pronounced seasonal differences in the bacterial microbiome of riparian, rather than Sahelian areas. These seasonal shifts were primarily in &lt;i&gt;Ralstonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sphingorhabdus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Duganella&lt;/i&gt; spp. bacteria that are usually soil and water-associated, indicating these changes may be from bacteria acquired in the larval environment, rather than adulthood. In Sahelian dry season mosquitoes, there was a unique intracellular bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Anaplasma&lt;/i&gt;, which likely was acquired through non-human blood feeding. Cytochrome B analysis of blood meals showed greater heterogeneity in host choice of &lt;i&gt;An&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coluzzii&lt;/i&gt; independent of season in the Thierola area compared to N’Gabakoro (77.5% vs. 94.6% human-origin blood meal, respectively), indicating a relaxation of anthropophily.

Its emerging importance puts &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; on the forefront of genetic interaction and evolution studies. However, a panel of suitable reference genes specific for this insect is as of now undescribed.

We analyse the behaviour of a non-linear model of coupled stock and bond prices exhibiting periodically collapsing bubbles. By using the formalism of dynamical system theory, we explain what drives the bubbles and how foreshocks or aftershocks are generated. A dynamical phase space representation of that system coupled with standard multiplicative noise rationalises the log-periodic power law singularity pattern documented in many historical financial bubbles. The notion of ‘ghosts of finite-time singularities’ is introduced and used to estimate the end of an evolving bubble, using finite-time singularities of an approximate normal form near the bifurcation point. We test the forecasting skill of this method on different stochastic price realisations and compare with Monte Carlo simulations of the full system. Remarkably, the approximate normal form is significantly more precise and less biased. Moreover, the method of ghosts of singularities is less sensitive to the noise realisation, thus providing more robust forecasts.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>be8252c3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Damian Smug, Peter Ashwin, Didier Sornette&lt;/p&gt;

Most Chinese lithic industries dated between 300,000 and 40,000 are characterized by the absence of Levallois debitage, the persistence of core-and-flake knapping, the rarity of prepared cores, their reduction with direct hard hammer percussion, and the rarity of retouched flakes. Here we report the discovery of seven bone soft hammers at the early hominin Lingjing site (Xuchang County, Henan) dated to 125,000–105,000. These artefacts represent the first instance of the use of bone as raw material to modify stone tools found at an East Asian early Late Pleistocene site. Three types of soft hammers are identified. The first consists of large bone flakes resulting from butchery of large herbivores that were utilized as such for expedient stone tools retouching or resharpening. The second involved the fracture of weathered bone from medium size herbivores to obtain elongated splinters shaped by percussion into sub-rectangular artefacts. Traces observed on these objects indicate intensive and possibly recurrent utilization, which implies their curation over time. The last consists of antler, occasionally used. Lingjing bone tools complement what we know about archaic hominin cultural adaptations in East Asia and highlight behavioural consistencies that could not be inferred from other cultural proxies. This discovery provides a new dimension to the debate surrounding the existence of the Middle Palaeolithic in the region. The attribution of East Asian sites to the Middle Palaeolithic assumes that cultural traits such as the Levallois method represent evolutionary hallmarks applicable to regions of the world different from those in which they were originally found. Here, we promote an approach that consists in identifying, possibly from different categories of material culture, the original features of each regional cultural trajectory and understanding the behavioural and cognitive implications they may have had for past hominin populations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>31cd62f3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Luc Doyon, Zhanyang Li, Hao Li, Francesco d’Errico&lt;/p&gt;

Here, we promote an approach that consists in identifying, possibly from different categories of material culture, the original features of each regional cultural trajectory and understanding the behavioural and cognitive implications they may have had for past hominin populations.</description><title>Discovery of &amp;lt;i&gt;circa&amp;lt;/i&gt; 115,000-year-old bone retouchers at Lingjing, Henan, China</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1621b5bd7fb:64d10ca:7c9981b6</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194318</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194318</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1520888400000</published><author><name>Luc Doyon</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1520877426683</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Charge_Transfer_Effects_in_Enzyme_Catalysis_Observed_with_Large-Scale_QM_MM_Free_Energy_Simulations/5985187</originId><summary><content>Hybrid quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations provide key insights into enzyme structure–function relationships.

Such generalization may be dependent upon memory instability. Following their formation, memories are unstable and able to interact with one another, allowing, at least in principle, common features to be extracted. Exploiting these common features creates generalized knowledge that can be applied across varied circumstances.

Changes in pathogen genetic variation within hosts alter the severity and spread of infectious diseases, with important implications for clinical disease and public health. Genetic drift may play a strong role in shaping pathogen variation, but analyses of drift in pathogens have oversimplified pathogen population dynamics, either by considering dynamics only at a single scale—such as within hosts or between hosts—or by making drastic simplifying assumptions, for example, that host immune systems can be ignored or that transmission bottlenecks are complete. Moreover, previous studies have used genetic data to infer the strength of genetic drift, whereas we test whether the genetic drift imposed by pathogen population processes can be used to explain genetic data. We first constructed and parameterized a mathematical model of gypsy moth baculovirus dynamics that allows genetic drift to act within and between hosts. We then quantified the genome-wide diversity of baculovirus populations within each of 143 field-collected gypsy moth larvae using Illumina sequencing. Finally, we determined whether the genetic drift imposed by host–pathogen population dynamics in our model explains the levels of pathogen diversity in our data. We found that when the model allows drift to act at multiple scales—including within hosts, between hosts, and between years—it can accurately reproduce the data, but when the effects of drift are simplified by neglecting transmission bottlenecks and stochastic variation in virus replication within hosts, the model fails. A de novo mutation model and a purifying selection model similarly fail to explain the data. Our results show that genetic drift can play a strong role in determining pathogen variation and that mathematical models that account for pathogen population growth at multiple scales of biological organization can be used to explain this variation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bmOg3KEZQRc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5f9b3962</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by David A.

Supplying food for the anticipated global population of over 9 billion in 2050 under changing climate conditions is one of the major challenges of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. Agricultural expansion and intensification contributes to global environmental change and risks the long-term sustainability of the planet. It has been proposed that no more than 15% of the global ice-free land surface should be converted to cropland. Bioenergy production for land-based climate mitigation places additional pressure on limited land resources. Here we test normative targets of food supply and bioenergy production within the cropland planetary boundary using a global land-use model. The results suggest supplying the global population with adequate food is possible without cropland expansion exceeding the planetary boundary. Yet this requires an increase in food production, especially in developing countries, as well as a decrease in global crop yield gaps. However, under current assumptions of future food requirements, it was not possible to also produce significant amounts of first generation bioenergy without cropland expansion. These results suggest that meeting food and bioenergy demands within the planetary boundaries would need a shift away from current trends, for example, requiring major change in the demand-side of the food system or advancing biotechnologies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2f96cfa1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by R.

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sensitive inflammatory marker rapidly increased in response to infection, injury or trauma during the acute phase. Resolution of the acute phase and SAA reduction are well documented, however the exact mechanism remains elusive. Two inducible SAA proteins, SAA1 and SAA2, with their variants could contribute to systemic inflammation. While unconjugated human variant SAA1α is already commercially available, the variants of SAA2 are not. Antibodies against SAA have been identified in apparently healthy blood donors (HBDs) in smaller, preliminary studies. So, our objective was to detect anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in the sera of 300 HBDs using ELISA, characterize their specificity and avidity. Additionally, we aimed to determine the presence of anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations and examine their effects on released IL-6 from SAA/SAA1α-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Autoantibodies against SAA and SAA1α had a median (IQR) absorbance OD (A&lt;sub&gt;450&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.655 (0.262–1.293) and 0.493 (0.284–0.713), respectively. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α exhibited heterogeneous to high avidity and reached peak levels between 41–50 years, then diminished with age in the oldest group (51–67 years). Women consistently exhibited significantly higher levels than men. Good positive correlation was observed between anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α were detected in IVIg, their fractions subsequently isolated, and shown to decrease IL-6 protein levels released from SAA/SAA1α-treated PBMCs. In conclusion, naturally occurring antibodies against SAA and anti-SAA1α could play a physiological role in down-regulating their antigen and proinflammatory cytokines leading to the resolution of the acute phase and could be an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>bbb665c1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tadeja Kuret, Katja Lakota, Polonca Mali, Saša Čučnik, Sonja Praprotnik, Matija Tomšič, Snezna Sodin-Semrl&lt;/p&gt;

Imaging data provide quantitative information about biological systems, however, mechanisms causing spatial patterning often remain illusive. In recent years, spatio-temporal mathematical modelling helped to overcome this problem. Yet, outliers and structured noise limit modelling of whole imaging data, and models often consider spatial summary statistics. Here, we introduce an integrated data-driven modelling approach that can cope with measurement artefacts and whole imaging data. Our approach combines mechanistic models of the biological processes with robust statistical models of the measurement process. The parameters of the integrated model are calibrated using a maximum likelihood approach. We used this integrated modelling approach to study in vivo gradients of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21). CCL21 gradients guide dendritic cells and are important in the adaptive immune response. Using artificial data, we verified that the integrated modelling approach provides reliable parameter estimates in the presence of measurement noise and that bias and variance of these estimates are reduced compared to conventional approaches. The application to experimental data allowed the parameterisation and subsequent refinement of the model using additional mechanisms. Among others, model-based hypothesis testing predicted lymphatic vessel dependent concentration of heparan sulfate, the binding partner of CCL21.

Imaging data provide quantitative information about biological systems, however, mechanisms causing spatial patterning often remain illusive. In recent years, spatio-temporal mathematical modelling helped to overcome this problem. Yet, outliers and structured noise limit modelling of whole imaging data, and models often consider spatial summary statistics. Here, we introduce an integrated data-driven modelling approach that can cope with measurement artefacts and whole imaging data. Our approach combines mechanistic models of the biological processes with robust statistical models of the measurement process. The parameters of the integrated model are calibrated using a maximum likelihood approach. We used this integrated modelling approach to study in vivo gradients of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21). CCL21 gradients guide dendritic cells and are important in the adaptive immune response. Using artificial data, we verified that the integrated modelling approach provides reliable parameter estimates in the presence of measurement noise and that bias and variance of these estimates are reduced compared to conventional approaches. The application to experimental data allowed the parameterisation and subsequent refinement of the model using additional mechanisms. Among others, model-based hypothesis testing predicted lymphatic vessel dependent concentration of heparan sulfate, the binding partner of CCL21. The selected model provided an accurate description of the experimental data and was partially validated using published data. Our findings demonstrate that integrated statistical modelling of whole imaging data is computationally feasible and can provide novel biological insights.</description><title>Mechanistic description of spatial processes using integrative modelling of noise-corrupted imaging data [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1623df7cfec:2576842:34f43e70</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284547v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284547v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><published>1521442800000</published><author><name>Hross, S.</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521458073580</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2856</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2856.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Ubiquitously expressed β-arrestin1 (β-arr1) and β-arrestin2 (β-arr2) proteins were originally identified and characterized based on their function to desensitize activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with respect to heterotrimeric G protein signaling, and to mediate GPCR endocytosis.

Douchi has been consumed as a flavoring ingredient for centuries. During production of douchi, numerous microorganisms play important roles in the hydrolysis and conversion of proteins and starch, which are related to the quality and flavor of the end product. Therefore, in the present study, the microbial diversity in two types of home-made traditional bacterial douchi from Gansu province in northwest China was studied by high-throughput sequencing, and a corresponding analysis of the bacterial and fungal communities were conducted. The results showed that geography may have impacted the fungal diversity and the bacterial and fungal species richness in the samples. The results also showed that the microbial community was significantly different in samples of different origin and the difference in the microbial community at the genus level was greater than at phylum level. Two dominant bacterial genera (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ignatzschineria&lt;/i&gt;) were common to the two samples, both of which had a relative abundance of more than 1%.

Jeffrey Beall himself has said that it was taken down under “intense pressure” from his employer (the University of Colorado at Denver), although his employer says no, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/18/librarians-list-predatory-journals-reportedly-removed-due-threats-and-politics&quot;&gt;not at all&lt;/a&gt;, this was his personal decision. (I know which side of that story I believe more). The businesses in this area are a touchy and litigious lot – well, at least in threatening to file lawsuits, anyway – and many legal departments would surely just rather not deal with all of the potential trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It now appears, though, that the list &lt;a href=&quot;https://beallslist.weebly.com/&quot;&gt;is back online&lt;/a&gt; in updated form, but is being &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02921-2&quot;&gt;maintained anonymously&lt;/a&gt;. One of the people behind it told &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; that they spend several hours a week dealing with inquiries and maintaining the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the journal titles aren’t already listed, the manager says they carry out an “in-depth analysis” of the publishers’ policies, checking them against a set of criteria originally laid out by Beall, and researching whether they are indexed on journal ‘whitelists’, such as the Directory of Open Access Journals or Journal Citation Reports. Journals or publishers deemed untrustworthy by the manager are included in an ‘update’ addendum on the blog. By March 2018, the new site had added 85 stand-alone journals and 27 publishers to Beall’s original lists of more than one thousand titles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for them. There are people who object to the idea that such journals are being called out anonymously, and there’s no doubt that the situation is open to potential abuse (although that doesn’t seem to be what’s happening so far). But what else to do when you’re barraged by threats if you do this work openly under your own name? Cabell’s is a company that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/07/25/cabells-new-predatory-journal-blacklist-review/&quot;&gt;taken on the challenge&lt;/a&gt;, with a subscription model blacklist (and whitelist), and it would be interesting to know what kind of flak they get from the hack publishers of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As that last link says, though, there can be some confusion (and has been on Cabell’s list and others) between low-quality journals and predatory ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So what are the problems? The most serious is that, as currently configured, Cabell’s Blacklist perpetuates the common problem of conflating low-quality journal publishing with deceptive or predatory publishing. In this case, the conflation happens because many of the blacklisting criteria Cabell’s applies are really quality criteria (“poor grammar and/or spelling,” “does not have a clearly stated peer review policy,” “no policy for digital preservation,” etc.) that can easily end up gathering fundamentally honest but less-competently-run journals into the same net as those journals that are actively trying to perpetrate a scam. Predatory and incompetent journals do often evince some of the same traits, but these traits don’t always indicate predatory intent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things overlap to a good degree, but not perfectly. Many of the predatory outfits, the we-have-three-hundred-journals-and-add-two-every-day folks, tend to be very sloppy and unprofessional quick-buck artists. But there are some rather slick ones, too, that at first glance don’t look that much different from actual journals. Meanwhile, there are actual journals, the smaller and/or newer ones, that can be rough around the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by an “actual journal”, then? There are perfectly good open-access journals, so we can’t say that the distinction is whether someone has to pay to read it. I’d say that the big distinction is some level of editorial control – and by that, I don’t only mean “Just a proportion of the papers make it in”, although that’s often the case. Even in more wide-open journals such as &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, papers are reviewed to make sure that they appear to be technically sound (they just don’t make calls on a paper’s impact or importance), and the same goes for many of the other respectable open-access titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings up another criterion: a real journal has some care for what it publishes. A fake or predatory journal, though, does not give a damn. Their reason to exist is to publish as many manuscripts as they can get and collect the payments for them, and if those manuscripts are faked, incoherent, or plagiarized? &lt;em&gt;Oh well.&lt;/em&gt; Did the payment clear? All right, then. Plenty of other journals and their publishers are trying to make money – and how – but their method of doing so runs through some variation of “Attain and preserve some level of respect from the readers and authors”. That’s as opposed to “Shear those sheep and keep the line moving”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to publish everything that comes in the door and maintain that respect, because the stuff that comes in that door is seriously contaminated with garbage. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/004641.html&quot;&gt;Here’s a famous post&lt;/a&gt; from the science-fiction publishing world, from editor Theresa Nielsen Hayden, called “Slushkiller”, about what comes in the transom where she works. About 70% of the submissions can be dismissed out of hand, usually within seconds, because the writing is &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; disjointed or incoherent. Another 25% of the stuff is written reasonably competently, but has a totally overused or borrowed plotline or has some other such flaw that would make it unsaleable. Now you’re down to the last five per cent or so, which is where the real editorial decisions actually start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific publishing is not as different as one might hope. I don’t know how many green-ink religious revelation manuscripts &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; get, but I’ll bet its a nonzero number. There are surely a lot of papers that come in written in such a disorganized manner that they cannot even be reviewed. Beyond that, there are many, many manuscripts that are readable and apparently not wrong, but are still not right for the journal they’ve been submitted to (often because of those impact and importance factors, which is where &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, etc. come in). &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, for example, has said that it rejects about 60% of submitted manuscripts without review, so although the proportion is a bit better than it was at Tor Books, it still means that a solid majority of all submissions don’t even clear the first hurdle of editorial attention. &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, for its part, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/15/plos-one-faced-decline-submissions-new-editor-speaks/&quot;&gt;said recently&lt;/a&gt; that it ends up rejecting about 50% of its submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast with a predatory journal could not be greater. They can, and do, publish whatever gibberish comes in, as long as the money is good, while all the time pretending to be what they are not. Editorial attention of any type is incompatible with their business model. That, to me, is the difference, and that is why these journals must be shunned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a736fc1d</fingerprint><description>“Beall’s List”, as a way to keep track of predatory publishers, has been officially offline for some time now.

A key focus of the racing industry is to reduce the number of race-day events where horses die suddenly or are euthanased due to catastrophic injury. The objective of this study was therefore to determine risk factors for race-day fatalities in Thoroughbred racehorses, using a cohort of all horses participating in flat racing in Great Britain between 2000 and 2013. Horse-, race- and course-level data were collected and combined with all race-day fatalities, recorded by racecourse veterinarians in a central database. Associations between exposure variables and fatality were assessed using logistic regression analyses for (1) all starts in the dataset and (2) starts made on turf surfaces only. There were 806,764 starts in total, of which 548,571 were on turf surfaces. A total of 610 fatalities were recorded; 377 (61.8%) on turf. In both regression models, increased firmness of the going, increasing racing distance, increasing average horse performance, first year of racing and wearing eye cover for the first time all increased the odds of fatality. Generally, the odds of fatality also increased with increasing horse age whereas increasing number of previous starts reduced fatality odds. In the ‘all starts’ model, horses racing in an auction race were at 1.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–2.01) times the odds of fatality compared with horses not racing in this race type. In the turf starts model, horses racing in Group 1 races were at 3.19 (95% CI 1.71–5.93) times the odds of fatality compared with horses not racing in this race type. Identification of novel risk factors including wearing eye cover and race type will help to inform strategies to further reduce the rate of fatality in flat racing horses, enhancing horse and jockey welfare and safety.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8f15b7c3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah M.

Background &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, an increasing popularity of marathons has been seen. Although running has been shown to have considerable positive health effects, the risk of sudden death, most often due to sudden cardiac arrests, is also a risk runners expose themselves to. Whilst there are some studies on the mortality amongst long-distance runners, much of the evidence is dated. Given the increased popularity in running during the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century as well as the improvements in medical care at marathons, more knowledge is required on the mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and method &lt;p&gt;Publicly available racing and news databases were used to identify the number of entrants and finishers in half to full marathons in Sweden between 2007 and 2016 and the number of deaths that occurred in conjunction with the races.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,156,271 runners entered a long distance (21-42km) running race in Sweden between 2007 and 2016, and 834,412 runners finished the races (72.2%). A large majority of the finishers (677,050 (81%)) competed in distances under a full marathon.

When added to the existing literature, the combined picture suggests a general downward trend in the risk of death during marathons since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Mortality in long-distance running races in Sweden - 2007–2016</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529f:9aea0a7d</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195626</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195626</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1523307600000</published><author><name>Finn Nilson</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1523295737183</crawled></item><item><engagement>2</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25790</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Room-temperature nine-µm-wavelength photodetectors and GHz-frequency heterodyne receivers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Room-temperature nine-µm-wavelength photodetectors and GHz-frequency heterodyne receivers, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25790&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nature25790&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Quantum-well photodetectors fabricated from photonic metamaterials show enhanced room-temperature sensitivity to long-wavelength infrared radiation and produce gigahertz-frequency heterodyne signals when pumped with quantum cascade lasers.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>6c22070b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Room-temperature nine-µm-wavelength photodetectors and GHz-frequency heterodyne receivers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Room-temperature nine-µm-wavelength photodetectors and GHz-frequency heterodyne receivers, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25790&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nature25790&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Quantum-well photodetectors fabricated from photonic metamaterials show enhanced room-temperature sensitivity to long-wavelength infrared radiation and produce gigahertz-frequency heterodyne signals when pumped with quantum cascade lasers.</description><title>Room-temperature nine-µm-wavelength photodetectors and GHz-frequency heterodyne receivers</title><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16262d9f4a5:59dca75:7d6c1c1c</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25790</link><published>1522047600000</published><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25790</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nature25790-f1.jpg</url><height>301</height></visual><author><name>Daniele Palaferri</name></author><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522076873893</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194471</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194471</originId><updated>1520974800000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Barbara Gandolfi, Robert A.

Inertial sensors offer the potential for integration into wireless virtual reality systems that allow the users to walk freely through virtual environments. However, owing to drift errors, inertial sensors cannot accurately estimate head and body orientations in the long run, and when walking indoors, this error cannot be corrected by magnetometers, due to the magnetic field distortion created by ferromagnetic materials present in buildings. This paper proposes a technique, called EHBD (Equalization of Head and Body Directions), to address this problem using two head- and shoulder-located magnetometers. Due to their proximity, their distortions are assumed to be similar and the magnetometer measurements are used to detect when the user is looking straight forward. Then, the system corrects the discrepancies between the estimated directions of the head and the shoulder, which are provided by gyroscopes and consequently are affected by drift errors. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of this technique in two tasks (navigation and navigation plus exploration) and using two different locomotion techniques: (1) gaze-directed mode (GD) in which the walking direction is forced to be the same as the head direction, and (2) decoupled direction mode (DD) in which the walking direction can be different from the viewing direction. The obtained results show that both locomotion modes show similar matching of the target path during the navigation task, while DD’s path matches the target path more closely than GD in the navigation plus exploration task. These results validate the EHBD technique especially when allowing different walking and viewing directions in the navigation plus exploration tasks, as expected. While the proposed method does not reach the accuracy of optical tracking (ideal case), it is an acceptable and satisfactory solution for users and is much more compact, portable and economical.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5fed306f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto de la Rubia, Antonio Diaz-Estrella, Arcadio Reyes-Lecuona, Alyson Langley, Michael Brown, Sarah Sharples&lt;/p&gt;

Our previous research demonstrated that tilianin protects the myocardium in a myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) rat model and has prominent pharmacological potential as a cardiovascular drug. Our study aimed to investigate the molecular signaling implicated in the improvement of myocardial survival induced by tilianin, a flavonoid antioxidant. Tilianin (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/d) or saline was orally administered to rats for 14 days. On the 15th day, ischemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery for 45 min, followed by 4 h of reperfusion. The levels of MIRI-induced serum myocardial enzymes and cardiomyocyte apoptosis as well as infarct size were examined to assess the cardioprotective effects. Cardiac tissues were collected for western blot analyses to determine the protein expression of anti-apoptotic signaling molecules. In MIRI-treated rats, our results revealed that pre-administration of high dose-tilianin the reduced release of LDH, MDA, and CK-MB and increased the plasma SOD level, and significantly attenuated the infarct size. Western blot analysis showed that a remarkable rise in expression of Bcl-2 and XIAP, and decline in expression of Bax, Smac/Diablo, HtrA2/Omi, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 was observed in the myocardium. The apoptosis index of cardiomyocytes further supports the cardioprotective effect of tilianin. Additionally, compared with the MIRI model group, pretreatment with high dose-tilianin group upregulated phosphorylated Akt and PI3K. In contrast, using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block Akt activation effectively inhibited the protective effects of tilianin against MIRI. Tilianin pretreatment was beneficial for activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting myocardial apoptosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b672c86a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cheng Zeng, Wen Jiang, Ruifang Zheng, Chenghui He, Jianguang Li, Jianguo Xing&lt;/p&gt;

Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has devastated the cattle industry in Sri Lanka many times in the past. Despite its seriousness, limited attempts have been made to understand the disease to ameliorate its effects–current recommendation for vaccines being based solely on immunological assessments rather than on molecular identification. The general belief is that the cattle population in Sri Lanka acquired the FMD virus (FMDV) strains via introductions from India. However, there could be endemic FMDV lineages circulating in Sri Lanka. To infer the phylogenetic relationships of the FMDV strains in the island, we sequenced the VP1 genomic region of the virus isolates collected during the 2014 outbreak together with a few reported cases in 2012 and 1997 and compared them to VP1 sequences from South Asia. The FMDV strains collected in the 2014 outbreak belonged to the lineage, Ind-2001d, of the topotype, ME-SA. The strains collected in 2012 and 1997 belonged to another lineage called &apos;unnamed&apos; by the World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease (WRLFMD). Based on the present analysis, we designate the lineage &apos;unnamed&apos; as Srl-97 which we found endemic to Sri Lanka. The evolutionary rates of Srl-97 and Ind-2001d in Sri Lanka were estimated to be 0.0004 and 0.0046 substitutions/site/year, respectively, suggesting that Srl-97 evolves slowly.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>601ed344</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by S.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness which is ultimately fatal, most often due to involvement of the diaphragm. Macrophage infiltration of dystrophic muscles has been strongly linked to muscle damage and fibrosis in DMD. We hypothesized that cenicriviroc (CVC), a dual chemokine receptor (CCR2/CCR5) antagonist currently under clinical evaluation for other diseases, could prevent macrophage accumulation and blunt disease progression in the diaphragms of mdx mice (genetic homologue of DMD). Treatment with CVC (20 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally) or vehicle was initiated in mdx mice at 2 weeks of age (prior to the onset of muscle necrosis) and continued for 4 weeks. Flow cytometry to assess inflammatory cell subsets as well as histological and force generation parameters were determined in mdx diaphragms at the conclusion of the treatment. CVC therapy induced a major (3.9-fold) reduction in total infiltrating macrophages, whereas total numbers of neutrophils and T lymphocytes (CD4+ and CD8+) were unaffected. No changes in macrophage polarization status (inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory skewing based on iNOS and CD206 expression) were observed. Muscle fiber size and fibrosis were not altered by CVC, whereas a significant reduction in centrally nucleated fibers was found suggesting a decrease in prior necrosis-regeneration cycles. In addition, maximal isometric force production by the diaphragm was increased by CVC therapy. These results suggest that CVC or other chemokine receptor antagonists which reduce pathological macrophage infiltration may have the potential to slow disease progression in DMD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>84e6d150</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Feng Liang, Christian Giordano, Dong Shang, Qian Li, Basil J.

Background &lt;p&gt;The burden of medically-attended acute gastro-enteritis (MA-AGE) that can be attributed to norovirus is not well established in Japan. Using a nationwide database of medical care insurance claims, we estimated the incidence of medically-attended norovirus-attributable gastroenteritis (MA-NGE) in Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The incidences of MA-NGE outpatient consultations or hospitalization in Japan were modelled on seasonal patterns of MA-AGE for unspecified causes derived from the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC) database for the period July 2007 to June 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age-adjusted annual incidence rates (per 10,000 person-years) of MA-NGE associated with outpatient care or hospitalization were 389 (95% CI 269–558) and 13 (95% CI 9–20), respectively. Highest rates were in children under 5 years of age: 1,569 (95% CI 1,325–1,792) for outpatient consultations and 48 (95% CI 39–56) for hospitalizations. Of all gastroenteritis episodes associated with outpatient care or hospitalization, 29% and 31% were attributed to norovirus, respectively. Norovirus was estimated to be responsible for 4,964,000 outpatient visits (95% CI 3,435,000–7,123,000) and 171,000 hospitalizations (95% CI 110,000–251,000) per year across Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Incidence rates of MA-AGE are high in Japan, and norovirus-attributable disease is at least as high as in some other developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>898522fb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chia-Hsien Chang, Motonobu Sakaguchi, John Weil, Thomas Verstraeten&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease, which is defined as having a reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and/or signs of kidney damage (albuminuria), is highly prevalent in Western society and is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. This warrants a search for risk factors of lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. Physical activity and sedentary behavior may be such risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine associations of physical activity (total, high, low), sedentary time and sedentary behavior patterns (breaks, prolonged bouts, average bout duration) with eGFR and albuminuria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We examined these associations in 2,258 participants of the Maastricht Study (average age 60.1±8.1 years; 51.3% men), who wore an accelerometer 24h/day on 7 consecutive days. Associations with continuous eGFR and categories of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; &amp;lt;15 [reference category], 15-&amp;lt;30, ≥30 mg/24h) were evaluated with linear regression analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After adjustment for potential confounders, each extra hour of total physical activity was associated with a more favorable kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.30 (95%CI = 1.46; 3.14)), whereas each extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with a more adverse kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.71 (-1.08; -0.35)). Also, compared to individuals with the lowest levels of total physical activity, individuals with the highest levels had less kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.63 (0.41; 0.96), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.84 (0.53; 1.35). An extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with more kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.11 (1.01; 1.22), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.10 (0.99; 1.22)). Further, a highly sedentary pattern was associated with a more adverse kidney function, but no association was seen with kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Physical activity and sedentary behavior were associated with kidney function and kidney damage. Additionally, sedentary behavior patterns were associated with kidney function. Causal studies are required to examine whether this indeed implicates that prevention strategies should focus not only on increasing physical activity, but on reducing sedentary behavior as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>76a5e3f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Remy J.

Associations with continuous eGFR and categories of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; &amp;lt;15 [reference category], 15-&amp;lt;30, ≥30 mg/24h) were evaluated with linear regression analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After adjustment for potential confounders, each extra hour of total physical activity was associated with a more favorable kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.30 (95%CI = 1.46; 3.14)), whereas each extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with a more adverse kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.71 (-1.08; -0.35)). Also, compared to individuals with the lowest levels of total physical activity, individuals with the highest levels had less kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.63 (0.41; 0.96), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.84 (0.53; 1.35). An extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with more kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.11 (1.01; 1.22), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.10 (0.99; 1.22)). Further, a highly sedentary pattern was associated with a more adverse kidney function, but no association was seen with kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Physical activity and sedentary behavior were associated with kidney function and kidney damage. Additionally, sedentary behavior patterns were associated with kidney function. Causal studies are required to examine whether this indeed implicates that prevention strategies should focus not only on increasing physical activity, but on reducing sedentary behavior as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Amount and pattern of physical activity and sedentary behavior are associated with kidney function and kidney damage: The Maastricht Study</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f8:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195306</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195306</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522875600000</published><author><name>Remy J.

Early diagnosis is critical for individuals with Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) in clinical practice because its progress is irreversible. In the existing literature, support vector machine (SVM) has always been applied to distinguish between AD and healthy controls (HC) based on neuroimaging data. But previous studies have only used a single SVM to classify AD and HC, and the accuracy is not very high and generally less than 90%. The method of random support vector machine cluster was proposed to classify AD and HC in this paper. From the Alzheimer&apos;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the subjects including 25 AD individuals and 35 HC individuals were obtained. The classification accuracy could reach to 94.44% in the results. Furthermore, the method could also be used for feature selection and the accuracy could be maintained at the level of 94.44%. In addition, we could also find out abnormal brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and cingulate cortex). It is worth noting that the proposed random support vector machine cluster could be a new insight to help the diagnosis of AD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5f2d5fed</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xia-an Bi, Qing Shu, Qi Sun, Qian Xu&lt;/p&gt;

Haploid laboratory strains of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; are commonly used for genetic engineering to enable their xylose utilization but little is known about the industrial yeast which is often recognized as diploid and as well as haploid and tetraploid. Here we report three unique signature pathway expression patterns and gene interactions in the centre metabolic pathways that signify xylose utilization of genetically engineered industrial yeast &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; NRRL Y-50463, a diploid yeast. Quantitative expression analysis revealed outstanding high levels of constitutive expression of &lt;i&gt;YXI&lt;/i&gt;, a synthesized yeast codon-optimized xylose isomerase gene integrated into chromosome XV of strain Y-50463. Comparative expression analysis indicated that the &lt;i&gt;YXI&lt;/i&gt; was necessary to initiate the xylose metabolic pathway along with a set of heterologous xylose transporter and utilization facilitating genes including &lt;i&gt;XUT4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;XUT6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;XKS1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;XYL2&lt;/i&gt;.

The significantly increased expression of the entire &lt;i&gt;PRS&lt;/i&gt; gene family facilitates functions of the life cycle and biosynthesis superpathway for the yeast.

Patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) can have extrahepatic manifestations. However, data about cardiac involvement of PBC is limited. We aimed in this study to analyze the clinical characteristics in patients with PBC complicated with and without cardiac involvement, and the risk factors of cardiac involvement in PBC. PBC patients admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2002 and February 2016 were consecutively enrolled. Structured interview, systemic rheumatologic examination, and laboratory tests were conducted for each patient, and risk factors of cardiac involvement were analyzed by comparing patients with and without cardiac involvement. In total, 580 PBC patients were enrolled, and cardiac involvement was identified in 24 patients (4%), with 11 male (46%) and a mean age of 57±8 year. Cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias were presented in 17 (70.8%) and 21 (87.5%) patients, respectively. Patients with cardiac involvement were more frequently male (46% vs. 11%, P&amp;lt;0.01), complicated with inflammatory myopathy (IM) (58% vs. 1%, P&amp;lt;0.01), and had a longer disease course (median, 72 vs 24 month, P&amp;lt;0.01). Furthermore, concomitant IM was the independent risk factor of cardiac involvement in PBC (OR = 77.333, 95% CI: 23.704–252.294). Cardiac involvement was a rare complication of PBC, which was more frequently observed in male or long-course patients. Importantly, concomitant IM was the strong independent risk factor of cardiac involvement in PBC. Given cardiac involvement is a serious complication, thorough evaluation of cardiac manifestation in high-risk PBC patients is highly recommended.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>754a3bfe</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sainan Bian, Hua Chen, Li Wang, Yunyun Fei, Yunjiao Yang, Linyi Peng, Yongzhe Li, Fengchun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; is a perennial herbaceous plant species mainly distributed in the tropics or subtropics of Asia and Africa. It has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time and now is utilized for the pharmaceutical, chemical and agriculture industries as a valued economic crop. Recently, &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; has attracted tremendous interest because of its high ceramide content. However, the breeding and genome studies are severely limited by the arduous whole genome sequencing of &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, the transcriptome data of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; was obtained by utilizing the high-throughput Illumina sequencing platform. Based on this information, the majority of the significant genes involved in the proposed sphingolipid metabolic pathway were identified. Then, the full-length neutral ceramidase cDNA was obtained with the help of its candidate transcripts, which were acquired from the transcriptome data. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this neutral ceramidase was a real ceramidase by eukaryotic expression in the yeast double knockout mutant Δypc1 Δydc1, which lacks the ceramidases—dihydroCDase (YDC1p), phytoCDase (YPC1p). In addition, the biochemical characterization of purified &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; ceramidase (AmCDase) exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an optimal activity ranging from pH 6.5 to 8.0. Based on our knowledge, this study is the first to report the related information of the neutral ceramidase in &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;.

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be overcome by electrical stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) via a cochlear implant (CI). Restricted CI performance results from the spatial gap between the SGNs and the electrode, but the efficacy of CI is also limited by the degeneration of SGNs as one consequence of SHNL. In the healthy cochlea, the survival of SGNs is assured by endogenous neurotrophic support. Several applications of exogenous neurotrophic supply have been shown to reduce SGN degeneration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In the present study, nanoporous silica nanoparticles (NPSNPs), with an approximate diameter of &amp;lt;100 nm, were loaded with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to test their efficacy as long-term delivery system for neurotrophins. The neurotrophic factor was released constantly from the NPSNPs over a release period of 80 days when the surface of the nanoparticles had been modified with amino groups. Cell culture investigations with NIH3T3 fibroblasts attest a good general cytocompatibility of the NPSNPs. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments with SGNs indicate a significantly higher survival rate of SGNs in cell cultures that contained BDNF-loaded nanoparticles compared to the control culture with unloaded NPSNPs (p&amp;lt;0.001). Importantly, also the amounts of BDNF released up to a time period of 39 days increased the survival rate of SGNs. Thus, NPSNPs carrying BDNF are suitable for the treatment of inner ear disease and for the protection and the support of SGNs. Their nanoscale nature and the fact that a direct contact of the nanoparticles and the SGNs is not necessary for neuroprotective effects, should allow for the facile preparation of nanocomposites, e.g., with biocompatible polymers, to install coatings on implants for the realization of implant-based growth factor delivery systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8ab24b99</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadeschda Schmidt, Jennifer Schulze, Dawid P.

That, put simply, is a different crystalline form, and any given substance can have several. Or a lot more than several. I don’t know what the record is for any single compound, but it’s way up into the dozens, and you never know when a new one might show up. You can get these different forms through all sorts of variations in the way the compound is crystallized or precipitated: different solvents, different temperatures, different types of stirring (yes indeed), different concentrations. . .and we haven’t even gotten to hydrates and solvates, where molecules of water or other solvents are incorporated into the crystal structure as it forms. And &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; can have polymorphs in turn, or different ratios of water and solvent, and there’s just no end to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymorphs can behave completely differently from each other. The same substance, completely pure, can come out looking like several unmistakable crystal types (rods, prisms, plates), in different crystalline space groups, with completely different melting points and solubility behavior. Past blog posts on this are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/10/22/phenylalanine_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/08/25/polymorphs_and_salts_india_raises_an_eyebrow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2011/01/12/gassing_your_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/04/01/novartis_loses_the_glivec_patent_fight_in_india&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and as that last one illustrates, this is definitely not something of just theoretical interest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=17333&quot;&gt;The saga&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-HIV drug Ritonavir is the classic example. That altered solubility behavior is of tremendous importance for drug dosing, and in Ritonavir’s case, a more stable (and less desirable!) polymorph appeared and threatened to disrupt the entire supply of the drug, because after a while, it was appearing more and more in the production line. “More stable”, of course, can easily mean “so stable it would rather not dissolve and get into the bloodstream”. Polymorphs themselves can be patented separately over such meaningful differences, as can methods for their production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even very simple compounds can show grindingly complex behavior. Aspirin, for example, exists in two polymorphs (so far) that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.200603373&quot;&gt;so similar&lt;/a&gt; that they can both show up &lt;em&gt;in the same single crystal&lt;/em&gt;, and it takes good X-ray data (and a good X-ray crystallographer) to work out what’s going on. One of those past blog post links is about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/blog/post-42/&quot;&gt;trickiness of phenylalanine&lt;/a&gt;, a substance you’d think had been studied to pieces by now. But as that link shows, D-ribose is in the same category: the crystallographic literature for years was all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about something even more simple than those? I refer to the most simple amino acid of all, glycine. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/anie.201800741&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has some details on its polymorphs, and the ridiculously subtle effects that cause them to form. There are three that form under “normal” conditions from aqueous solution, and while the gamma one is the most thermodynamically stable, the alpha one is kinetically favored. Adding small amounts of simple alcohols to the aqueous solution starts producing mixtures of the alpha and beta forms, though, and eventually, as the alcohol concentration goes up, you only get the beta form. All classic polymorph behavior. But why? Here’s what the authors found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Herein,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;applying&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;extremely&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;sensitive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;pyroelectric &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;measurements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;impedance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;spectroscopy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;different &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;temperatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;discovered&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;methanol,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;unlike&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;water,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;incorporated&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;polar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;within&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;bulk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;growing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-polymorph.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Consequently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;solvent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;molecules&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;create &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;polar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;domains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;exhibit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;pyroelectricity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(i.e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;they &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;develop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;temporary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;voltage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;exposed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;temperature &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;changes). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;result,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;follows&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;incorporated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;solvent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;molecules&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;operate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;conventional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“tailor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-made” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;inhibitors &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;polymorph.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that the alpha-form starts growing in a pyramidal shape, just as it usually does, but then starts incorporating methanol-solvated glycine molecules into its growing lattice. This buries methanol molecules into the crystal as it continues forming, and creates zones of higher polarity because of the different orientation of those solvated glycines (and the slight deformations in the nearest neighbor glycine arrangements as well). The normal arrangement in the crystal is a sort of “canceled-out” glycine dimer, but that gets disrupted into a more polarizable form. That’s the origin of the pyroelectric effect they’re able to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this starts happening, that developing surface of the crystal ends up “poisoned”, as some molecular dynamic simulations suggest, by the methanols incorporated into the lattice. The new surface doesn’t recognize the usual glycine-dimer form so readily, and further growth is inhibited – you see truncated pyramids of the alpha-form that have stopped in their tracks. Meanwhile, the beta-form end up with one surface (a more hydrophilic one) similarly poisoned and inhibited, but another one (a more hydrophobic one) is totally unaffected, so the crystal grows more rapidly along that face and produces long rods of the beta-form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of detail answers some questions and raises others. There are probably all sorts of metastable crystal forms (and crystal surfaces) showing up in complex polymorph situations, and the ability to see and characterize these things will (as in this case) give us a better physical picture of what’s going on. But predicting such behavior is another thing entirely. You’d hope as we start to pile up enough detail that predictive power will start to emerge (hello, machine learning). That’s a reasonable hope, but there’s no reason that things have to work out that way. The whole “Big Data” effort across various sciences is putting that view of the world to the test, and sometimes it’s going to work out and sometimes it isn’t.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Patients with inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) are frequently exposed to computed tomography (CT). Each CT exposes patients to radiation that cumulatively could increase the risk of malignancy, particularly in younger patients. We aim to study the effect of age on CT use in IBD patients seen in the Emergency Department (ED) or the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study of IBD patients identified in Truven Health Marketscan databases between 2009–2013. The main outcome was use of CT during an ED or inpatient visit. Effect of age on CT use was characterized using logistic regression accounting for important covariables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 66,731 patients with IBD with 144,147 ED or inpatient visits in this cohort with a diagnosis code of IBD. At first visit, 5.8% percent were below age 18. CT was utilized in 26.6% of visits. In multivariable analysis, adjusting for medications, recent surgery, and gender, patients 18–35 were more likely to undergo CT (OR 2.35, 95%CI: 2.20–2.52) compared to those &amp;lt;18. Examining patients only between 16 and 19, the odds of an 18 or 19-year-old undergoing CT is significantly higher than a 16 or 17-year-old (OR 1.96, 95%CI: 1.71–2.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with IBD undergo CT more than a quarter of the time in the ED or inpatient setting. Pediatric providers limit radiation exposure among those &amp;lt;18 while adult providers are not as cautious with radiation exposure for the young adult population. Increased awareness of the risks of cumulative radiation exposure in the young adult population is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>eb75d292</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shail M.

Effect of age on CT use was characterized using logistic regression accounting for important covariables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 66,731 patients with IBD with 144,147 ED or inpatient visits in this cohort with a diagnosis code of IBD. At first visit, 5.8% percent were below age 18. CT was utilized in 26.6% of visits. In multivariable analysis, adjusting for medications, recent surgery, and gender, patients 18–35 were more likely to undergo CT (OR 2.35, 95%CI: 2.20–2.52) compared to those &amp;lt;18. Examining patients only between 16 and 19, the odds of an 18 or 19-year-old undergoing CT is significantly higher than a 16 or 17-year-old (OR 1.96, 95%CI: 1.71–2.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with IBD undergo CT more than a quarter of the time in the ED or inpatient setting. Pediatric providers limit radiation exposure among those &amp;lt;18 while adult providers are not as cautious with radiation exposure for the young adult population. Increased awareness of the risks of cumulative radiation exposure in the young adult population is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>CT utilization abruptly increases at age 18 among patients with inflammatory bowel diseases in the hospital</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1b:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195022</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195022</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522357200000</published><author><name>Shail M.

Avian Colibacillosis is among the major causes of economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide, with a more vivid impact on developing countries. The involvement of several bacteria has made it challenging to develop effective vaccines for this disease, particularly because it is notoriously difficult to make a vaccine that contains all the contributing pathogenic bacteria. Here, we report the design and fabrication of a bacterial ghost (BG) of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O78:K80, which is among the major bacterial serotypes responsible for this disease. The generated ghost is then exploited as a homologous vaccine against Avian Colibacillosis. We demonstrate that hole formation in the cell wall of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O78:K80 can happen properly in optical densities as high as 0.8 compared to the 0.3–0.4 standard for bacteria like &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10. This is especially advantageous for mass production of this ghost which is a vital factor in development of any BG-based vaccine. Compared to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10, we faced a great challenge in transforming the wild type bacteria with the E-lysis plasmid which was probably due to higher thickness of the cell wall in O78:K80. This, however, was addressed by treating the cell wall with a different combination of ions.The vaccine was administered to Ross 308 broiler chickens via injection as well as through their respiratory system at a dose of 1010 BGs, repeated 3 times at weekly intervals. Chickens were then challenged with the wild type O78:K80 at a dose of 1011 bacteria together with Infectious Bronchitis H120 vaccine (as immunosuppressant) one week after the last immunization. Air sac lesions were significantly reduced in BG vaccinated groups in comparison with the control group. The levels of IFN&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;, IgA and IgY were measured in the serum of immunized chickens as an indication of immune response and were compared with those of the chickens vaccinated with killed bacteria.

Estimation of visibility bias is critical to accurately compute abundance of wild populations. The franciscana, &lt;i&gt;Pontoporia blainvillei&lt;/i&gt;, is considered the most threatened small cetacean in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Aerial surveys are considered the most effective method to estimate abundance of this species, but many existing estimates have been considered unreliable because they lack proper estimation of correction factors for visibility bias. In this study, helicopter surveys were conducted to determine surfacing-diving intervals of franciscanas and to estimate availability for aerial platforms. Fifteen hours were flown and 101 groups of 1 to 7 franciscanas were monitored, resulting in a sample of 248 surface-dive cycles. The mean surfacing interval and diving interval times were 16.10 seconds (SE = 9.74) and 39.77 seconds (SE = 29.06), respectively. Availability was estimated at 0.39 (SE = 0.01), a value 16–46% greater than estimates computed from diving parameters obtained from boats or from land. Generalized mixed-effects models were used to investigate the influence of biological and environmental predictors on the proportion of time franciscana groups are visually available to be seen from an aerial platform. These models revealed that group size was the main factor influencing the proportion at surface. The use of negatively biased estimates of availability results in overestimation of abundance, leads to overly optimistic assessments of extinction probabilities and to potentially ineffective management actions. This study demonstrates that estimates of availability must be computed from suitable platforms to ensure proper conservation decisions are implemented to protect threatened species such as the franciscana.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>feee6ace</fingerprint><title>Refining estimates of availability bias to improve assessments of the conservation status of an endangered dolphin</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d62:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Sucunza, Daniel Danilewicz, Marta Cremer, Artur Andriolo, Alexandre N.

The franciscana, &lt;i&gt;Pontoporia blainvillei&lt;/i&gt;, is considered the most threatened small cetacean in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Aerial surveys are considered the most effective method to estimate abundance of this species, but many existing estimates have been considered unreliable because they lack proper estimation of correction factors for visibility bias. In this study, helicopter surveys were conducted to determine surfacing-diving intervals of franciscanas and to estimate availability for aerial platforms. Fifteen hours were flown and 101 groups of 1 to 7 franciscanas were monitored, resulting in a sample of 248 surface-dive cycles. The mean surfacing interval and diving interval times were 16.10 seconds (SE = 9.74) and 39.77 seconds (SE = 29.06), respectively. Availability was estimated at 0.39 (SE = 0.01), a value 16–46% greater than estimates computed from diving parameters obtained from boats or from land. Generalized mixed-effects models were used to investigate the influence of biological and environmental predictors on the proportion of time franciscana groups are visually available to be seen from an aerial platform. These models revealed that group size was the main factor influencing the proportion at surface. The use of negatively biased estimates of availability results in overestimation of abundance, leads to overly optimistic assessments of extinction probabilities and to potentially ineffective management actions. This study demonstrates that estimates of availability must be computed from suitable platforms to ensure proper conservation decisions are implemented to protect threatened species such as the franciscana.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194213</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194213</link><author><name>Federico Sucunza</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1520974800000</published></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5016342?af=R</originId><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><fingerprint>f6ce52c5</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><title>An improved molecular dynamics algorithm to study thermodiffusion in binary hydrocarbon mixtures</title><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1622364c343:d037d:34f43e70</id><unread>False</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5016342?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5016342?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><published>1520944257000</published><author><name>Sylvie Antoun</name></author><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/10&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 10&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521012228931</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01575</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01575/20180329/images/medium/jm-2017-01575r_0019.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01575&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

We illustrate use cases with three analyses of electronic health records (EHRs): (1) pairwise comparison of patient records, (2) analysis of cohort structure, and (3) evaluation of methods for generating simulated patient data.</description><title>Fast and simple comparison of semi-structured data, with emphasis on electronic health records [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16287224687:8bf56cd:7d6c1c1c</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293183v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293183v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><published>1522652400000</published><author><name>Robinson, M.</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522685593223</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193078</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193078</originId><updated>1520888400000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandre Lobo-da-Cunha, Diogo Amaral-de-Carvalho, Elsa Oliveira, Ângela Alves, Vítor Costa, Gonçalo Calado&lt;/p&gt;
Mannitol oxidase and polyol dehydrogenases are enzymes that convert polyalcohols into sugars. Mannitol oxidase was previously investigated in terrestrial snails and slugs, being also present in a few aquatic gastropods. However, the overall distribution of this enzyme in the Gastropoda was not known. Polyol dehydrogenases are also poorly studied in gastropods and other mollusks. In this study, polyalcohol oxidase and dehydrogenase activities were assayed in the digestive gland of 26 species of gastropods, representing the clades Patellogastropoda, Neritimorpha, Vetigastropoda, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia. Marine, freshwater and terrestrial species, including herbivores and carnivores were analyzed. Ultrastructural observations were undertake in species possessing mannitol oxidase, in order to investigate the correlation between this enzyme and the presence of tubular structures known to be associated with it. Mannitol oxidase activity was detected in the digestive gland of herbivores from the clades Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia, but not in any carnivores or in herbivores from the clades Patellogastropoda, Neritimorpha and Vetigastropoda. In most of the species used in this study, dehydrogenase activities were detected using both D-mannitol and D-sorbitol as substrates. Nevertheless, in some carnivores these activities were not detected with both polyalcohols. Ultrastructural observations revealed tubular structures in digestive gland cells of some species having mannitol oxidase activity, but they were not observed in others. Based on our results, we suggest that mannitol oxidase first occurred in a herbivorous or omnivorous ancestor of Apogastropoda, the clade formed by caenogastropods and heterobranchs, being subsequently lost in those species that shifted towards a carnivorous diet.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ea5c1578</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandre Lobo-da-Cunha, Diogo Amaral-de-Carvalho, Elsa Oliveira, Ângela Alves, Vítor Costa, Gonçalo Calado&lt;/p&gt;

Body size governs predator-prey interactions, which in turn structure populations, communities, and food webs. Understanding predator-prey size relationships is valuable from a theoretical perspective, in basic research, and for management applications. However, predator-prey size data are limited and costly to acquire. We quantified predator-prey total length and mass relationships for several freshwater piscivorous taxa: crappie (&lt;i&gt;Pomoxis&lt;/i&gt; spp.), largemouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus salmoides&lt;/i&gt;), muskellunge (&lt;i&gt;Esox masquinongy&lt;/i&gt;), northern pike (&lt;i&gt;Esox lucius&lt;/i&gt;), rock bass (&lt;i&gt;Ambloplites rupestris&lt;/i&gt;), smallmouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus dolomieu&lt;/i&gt;), and walleye (&lt;i&gt;Sander vitreus&lt;/i&gt;). The range of prey total lengths increased with predator total length. The median and maximum ingested prey total length varied with predator taxon and length, but generally ranged from 10–20% and 32–46% of predator total length, respectively. Predators tended to consume larger fusiform prey than laterally compressed prey. With the exception of large muskellunge, predators most commonly consumed prey between 16 and 73 mm. A sensitivity analysis indicated estimates can be very accurate at sample sizes greater than 1,000 diet items and fairly accurate at sample sizes greater than 100. However, sample sizes less than 50 should be evaluated with caution. Furthermore, median log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; predator-prey body mass ratios ranged from 1.9–2.5, nearly 50% lower than values previously reported for freshwater fishes. Managers, researchers, and modelers could use our findings as a tool for numerous predator-prey evaluations from stocking size optimization to individual-based bioenergetics analyses identifying prey size structure. To this end, we have developed a web-based user interface to maximize the utility of our models that can be found at www.LakeEcologyLab.org/pred_prey.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b2ec324c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jereme W.

For each case up to 6 controls, matched for birth year and gestational age, were selected. The resulting study population consisted of 720 cases and 3,567 controls. Information on socioeconomic data about the mother, maternal morbidity, pregnancy related diagnoses, perinatal diagnoses of the infant, and procedures in the perinatal period, was obtained for all cases and controls and analyzed with univariable and multivariable logistic regressions for the whole study population as well as for subgroups according to gestational age.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the study population as a whole, we found independent positive associations with necrotizing enterocolitis for isoimmunization, fetal distress, cesarean section, neonatal bacterial infection including sepsis, erythrocyte transfusion, persistent ductus arteriosus, cardiac malformation, gastrointestinal malformation, and chromosomal abnormality. Negative associations were found for maternal weight, preeclampsia, maternal urinary infection, premature rupture of the membranes, and birthweight. Different patterns of associations were seen in the subgroups of different gestational age.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;With some interesting exceptions, especially in negative associations, the results of this large, population based study, are in keeping with earlier studies.

The detection of recurrent somatic chromosomal rearrangements is standard of care for most leukemia types. Even though karyotype analysis—a low-resolution genome-wide chromosome analysis—is still the gold standard, it often needs to be complemented with other methods to increase resolution. To evaluate the feasibility and applicability of mate pair whole genome sequencing (MP-WGS) to detect structural chromosomal rearrangements in the diagnostic setting, we sequenced ten bone marrow samples from leukemia patients with recurrent rearrangements. Samples were selected based on cytogenetic and FISH results at leukemia diagnosis to include common rearrangements of prognostic relevance. Using MP-WGS and in-house bioinformatic analysis all sought rearrangements were successfully detected. In addition, unexpected complexity or additional, previously undetected rearrangements was unraveled in three samples. Finally, the MP-WGS analysis pinpointed the location of chromosome junctions at high resolution and we were able to identify the exact exons involved in the resulting fusion genes in all samples and the specific junction at the nucleotide level in half of the samples. The results show that our approach combines the screening character from karyotype analysis with the specificity and resolution of cytogenetic and molecular methods. As a result of the straightforward analysis and high-resolution detection of clinically relevant rearrangements, we conclude that MP-WGS is a feasible method for routine leukemia diagnostics of structural chromosomal rearrangements.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>45465d1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anh Nhi Tran, Fulya Taylan, Vasilios Zachariadis, Ingegerd Ivanov Öfverholm, Anna Lindstrand, Francesco Vezzi, Britta Lötstedt, Magnus Nordenskjöld, Ann Nordgren, Daniel Nilsson, Gisela Barbany&lt;/p&gt;

As a result of the straightforward analysis and high-resolution detection of clinically relevant rearrangements, we conclude that MP-WGS is a feasible method for routine leukemia diagnostics of structural chromosomal rearrangements.</description><title>High-resolution detection of chromosomal rearrangements in leukemias through mate pair whole genome sequencing</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1621b4b57ed:64b3a76:7c9981b6</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193928</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193928</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1520888400000</published><author><name>Anh Nhi Tran</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1520876345325</crawled></item><item><engagement>139</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0104-6</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neural mediators of changes of mind about perceptual decisions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neural mediators of changes of mind about perceptual decisions, Published online: 12 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0104-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0104-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Changing one’s mind requires revising previous decisions in light of new evidence.

&lt;i&gt;Camellia nitidissima&lt;/i&gt; Chi (CNC) is a valuable medicinal and edible plant in China. In this study, CNC flowers were extracted with 95% ethanol, then partitioned into dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol, and water fractions, with the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and other phytochemicals in CNC flowers investigated for the first time. Results showed that the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity and highest total phenolic content (TPC) compared with the other fractions. Furthermore, in the ethyl acetate fraction, the 50% effective concentrations (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of ABTS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and DPPH radical scavenging activities were 64.24 ± 1.80 and 78.80 ± 0.34 μg/mL, respectively, and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was 801.49 ± 2.30 μM FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 1,000 μg/mL.

&lt;i&gt;Camellia nitidissima&lt;/i&gt; Chi (CNC) is a valuable medicinal and edible plant in China. In this study, CNC flowers were extracted with 95% ethanol, then partitioned into dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol, and water fractions, with the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and other phytochemicals in CNC flowers investigated for the first time. Results showed that the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity and highest total phenolic content (TPC) compared with the other fractions. Furthermore, in the ethyl acetate fraction, the 50% effective concentrations (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of ABTS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and DPPH radical scavenging activities were 64.24 ± 1.80 and 78.80 ± 0.34 μg/mL, respectively, and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was 801.49 ± 2.30 μM FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 1,000 μg/mL. Pearson’s correlation coefficients and principal component analyses (PCA) for the TPC and antioxidant capacity of the five fractions indicated that the phenolic compounds were the major antioxidant constituents in the flowers. To exploit the antioxidants in CNC flowers, 21 phenolic compounds in the ethanolic extract fraction were identified by HPLC Triple TOF MS/MS, next, 12 flavonoids were isolated and elucidated, of which compounds 1–5 showed potent antioxidant capacity.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to discover new cell types by detecting sub-populations in a heterogeneous group of cells. Since scRNA-seq experiments have lower read coverage/tag counts and introduce more technical biases compared to bulk RNA-seq experiments, the limited number of sampled cells combined with the experimental biases and other dataset specific variations presents a challenge to cross-dataset analysis and discovery of relevant biological variations across multiple cell populations. In this paper, we introduce a method of variance-driven multitask clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data (scVDMC) that utilizes multiple single-cell populations from biological replicates or different samples. scVDMC clusters single cells in multiple scRNA-seq experiments of similar cell types and markers but varying expression patterns such that the scRNA-seq data are better integrated than typical pooled analyses which only increase the sample size. By controlling the variance among the cell clusters within each dataset and across all the datasets, scVDMC detects cell sub-populations in each individual experiment with shared cell-type markers but varying cluster centers among all the experiments. Applied to two real scRNA-seq datasets with several replicates and one large-scale Drop-seq dataset on three patient samples, scVDMC more accurately detected cell populations and known cell markers than pooled clustering and other recently proposed scRNA-seq clustering methods. In the case study applied to in-house Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) scRNA-seq data, scVDMC revealed several new cell types and unknown markers validated by flow cytometry.

Identifying effective antivirals for treating Ebola virus disease (EVD) and minimizing transmission of such disease is critical. A variety of cell-based assays have been developed for evaluating compounds for activity against Ebola virus. However, very few reports discuss the variable assay conditions that can affect the results obtained from these drug screens. Here, we describe variable conditions tested during the development of our cell-based drug screen assays designed to identify compounds with anti-Ebola virus activity using established cell lines and human primary cells. The effect of multiple assay readouts and variable assay conditions, including virus input, time of infection, and the cell passage number, were compared, and the impact on the effective concentration for 50% and/ or 90% inhibition (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, EC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;) was evaluated using the FDA-approved compound, toremifene citrate. In these studies, we show that altering cell-based assay conditions can have an impact on apparent drug potency as measured by the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;.

A total of 112 men (125 breast masses) with preoperative breast ultrasonography (US) were included (median age, 59.50 years; age range, 15–96 years). Data extracted included patient age, if the lesions were bilateral, palpable, and tender, and the presence of nipple discharge. Breast lesion features on static US images were reviewed by three experienced radiologists without knowledge of physical examination or pathology results, original breast US image interpretations, or surgical outcomes. The US features were documented according to the BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) US lexicons. A forth radiologist compiled the data for analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 125 breast masses, palpable tender lumps and bilateral synchronous masses were more likely to be benign than malignant (both, 100% vs 0%, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Advanced age and bloody discharge from nipples were common in malignant lesions (P &amp;lt;0.05). A mass eccentric to a nipple, irregular shape, the presence of an echogenic halo, predominantly internal vascularity, and rich color flow signal on color Doppler ultrasound were significantly related to malignancy (all, P &amp;lt; 0.05).

Background &lt;p&gt;Accurate estimates of the impact of alcohol on overall and age-specific mortality are crucial for formulating health policies.

Objectives and methods &lt;p&gt;Using a randomized, crossover, counterbalanced approach, cyclists (N = 20, overnight fasted state) engaged in the four 75-km time trials (2-week washout) while ingesting two types of bananas with similar carbohydrate (CHO) but different phenolic content (Cavendish, CAV; mini-yellow, MIY, 63% higher polyphenols), a 6% sugar beverage (SUG), and water only (WAT). CHO intake was set at 0.2 g/kg every 15 minutes. Blood samples were collected pre-exercise and 0 h-, 0.75 h-,1.5 h-, 3 h-, 4.5 h-, 21 h-, 45 h-post-exercise.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Each of the CHO trials (CAV, MIY, SUG) compared to water was associated with higher post-exercise plasma glucose and fructose, and lower leukocyte counts, plasma 9+13 HODES, and IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra. OPLS-DA analysis showed that metabolic perturbation (N = 1,605 metabolites) for WAT (86.8±4.0 arbitrary units) was significantly greater and sustained than for CAV (70.4±3.9, P = 0.006), MIY (68.3±4.0, P = 0.002), and SUG (68.1±4.2, P = 0.002). VIP ranking (&amp;lt;3.0, N = 25 metabolites) showed that both CAV and MIY were associated with significant fold changes in metabolites including those from amino acid and xenobiotics pathways. OPLS-DA analysis of immediate post-exercise metabolite shifts showed a significant separation of CAV and MIY from both WAT and SUG (R2Y = 0.848, Q2Y = 0.409). COX-2 mRNA expression was lower in both CAV and MIY, but not SUG, versus WAT at 21-h post-exercise in THP-1 monocytes cultured in plasma samples. Analysis of immediate post-exercise samples showed a decrease in LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocyte extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in CAV and MIY, but not SUG, compared to WAT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CHO ingestion from bananas or a sugar beverage had a comparable influence in attenuating metabolic perturbation and inflammation following 75-km cycling. Ex-vivo analysis with THP-1 monocytes supported a decrease in COX-2 mRNA expression and reduced reliance on glycolysis for ATP production following ingestion of bananas but not sugar water when compared to water alone.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov, U.S. National Institutes of Health, identifier: NCT02994628&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f22a8a91</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by David C.

Lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes (DM2) prevention implementation studies can be effective and lasting. Long-term weight loss maintenance enhances the intervention effect through a significant decrease in diabetes incidence over time. Our objective was to identify factors predicting long-term successful weight reduction maintenance achieved during a DM2 prevention program in patients with high DM2 risk in primary health care. Study participants (n = 263), middle-aged, slightly obese with baseline increased DM2 risk (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC)&gt;14), but no diabetes were invited to receive 11 lifestyle counselling sessions, guided physical activity sessions and motivational support during 10-months. The study participants had three clinical examinations during the study (baseline, one and three years). Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of weight reduction maintenance two years after the discontinuation of the intervention. Out of 105 patients who completed all three examinations (baseline age 56.6 (standard deviation (SD) = 10.7), body mass index 31.1 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (SD = 4.9), FINDRISC 18.6 (SD = 3.1)), 73 patients (70%) showed weight loss during the intervention (mean weight loss 4.2 kg, SD = 5.1). The total weight loss achieved in the maintainers (27 of 73 study participants) two years after the intervention had finished was 6.54 kg (4.47 kg+2.0 kg). The non-maintainers, on the other hand, returned to their initial weight at the start of the intervention (+0.21 kg). In multivariable analysis baseline history of increased glucose (odds ratio (OR) = 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–13.6) and reduction of total fat in diet during follow-up (OR = 4.3; 95% CI 1.5–12.2) were independent predictors of successful weight loss. Further studies exploring predictors of weight loss maintenance in diabetes prevention are needed to help health care providers to redesign interventions and improve long-term outcomes of real life interventions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a15c8eea</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska, Noël C.

Interactions between DNA and proteins located in the cell nucleus play an important role in controlling physiological processes by specifying, augmenting and regulating context-specific transcription events. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a widely used methodology to study DNA-protein interactions and has been successfully used in various cell types for over three decades. More recently, by combining ChIP with genomic screening technologies and Next Generation Sequencing (e.g. ChIP-seq), it has become possible to profile DNA-protein interactions (including covalent histone modifications) across entire genomes. However, the applicability of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq has rarely been extended to non-model species because of a number of technical challenges. Here we report a method that can be used to identify genome wide covalent histone modifications in a group of non-model fruit fly species (Diptera: Tephritidae). The method was developed by testing and refining protocols that have been used in model organisms, including &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that this method is suitable for a group of economically important pest fruit fly species, viz., &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera dorsalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ceratitis capitata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zeugodacus cucurbitae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera tryoni&lt;/i&gt;. We also report an example ChIP-seq dataset for &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tryoni&lt;/i&gt;, providing evidence for histone modifications in the genome of a tephritid fruit fly for the first time. Since tephritids are major agricultural pests globally, this methodology will be a valuable resource to study taxa-specific evolutionary questions and to assist with pest management. It also provides a basis for researchers working with other non-model species to undertake genome wide DNA-protein interaction studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fd9667ce</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kumaran Nagalingam, Michał T.

This paper examines the effect of maternal socio-economic status in the household, such as their autonomy, ability, freedom and bargaining power, on child birth registration in India using the nationally representative India Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II), 2011–12. We have estimated a multilevel mixed effects model which accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data and allows us to examine the effects of unobserved ‘district’ and ‘community’ characteristics along with individual child level characteristics on probability of birth registration. The results show that between-districts and between individuals differences share a considerably high and an almost equal proportion of the variations in probability of birth registration in India. At individual child level, mother’s socio-economic status such as her ability to move around independently and her exposure to outside world, significantly raise the probability of birth registration. More importantly, the marginal effects of the maternal autonomy indicators: mother’s ability to move around freely and her control over resources, on birth registration vary across districts in India. Other variables such as institutional birth, mother’s antenatal care seeking behaviour, caste, religion, household wealth and parental education are significant determinants of birth registration.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>711e885</fingerprint><title>Maternal autonomy and birth registration in India: Who gets counted?</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d57:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Itismita Mohanty, Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin&lt;/p&gt;

Other variables such as institutional birth, mother’s antenatal care seeking behaviour, caste, religion, household wealth and parental education are significant determinants of birth registration.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194095</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194095</link><author><name>Itismita Mohanty</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1520974800000</published></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00475</originId><summary><content>&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00475&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Although significant attention has been devoted to analyzing stigma associated with epilepsy, there is still a significant lack of valid and reliable instruments. We aimed to validate the 23-item Czech version of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE; originally developed in Brazil), which has been used to evaluate epilepsy-related stigma in the general population. Verification of the SSE questionnaire was carried out in a group of 207 students aged 15–18 years of whom none had epilepsy. These students completed the SSE twice in a period of 3–6 months as part of standard test-retest evaluation practice. The instrument exhibits good psychometric properties including internal consistency higher than in the original version (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.856 here compared with 0.81 reported in Brazil) and acceptable test-retest reliability. Using exploratory factor analysis (not provided for the original version), four factors were identified and corresponding subscales were described and interpreted. Two items did not fit into the structure and were eliminated. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to propose and verify the hierarchical 4-factor structure of the Czech version of SSE confirming the existence of a common factor corresponding to stigma. The results showed that the Czech version of SSE has good psychometric properties and can be used in further research and clinical practice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a2b21182</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dana Brabcová, Jiří Kohout, Daniel Potužák, Barbora Beňová, Pavel Kršek&lt;/p&gt;

British &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; complex [&lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato) mosquito distribution, abundance, and potential for disease transmission are intimately linked to their environment. Pond and lake dyes that block light to restrict algal photosynthesis are a relatively new product assumed to be an environmentally friendly since they are based on food dyes. Their use in urban garden ponds raises questions linked to mosquito oviposition, since coloured water can be an attractant. &lt;i&gt;Culex (&lt;/i&gt;mostly &lt;i&gt;pipiens)&lt;/i&gt; is commonly found in UK gardens and is a potential vector of viruses including the West Nile Virus (WNV). Any factors that significantly change the distribution and population of &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; could impact future risks of disease transmission. A gravid trap was used to catch female &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes for use in oviposition choice tests in laboratory and semi-field conditions. Two types of pond dye, blue and shadow (which looks slightly red), were tested for their impact on oviposition and survival of wild caught &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt;. There were no significant differences in the number of egg batches laid when gravid mosquitoes were given a choice between either blue dye and clear water or shadow dye and clear water indicating that these dyes are not attractants. Larvae hatched from egg batches laid by wild-caught gravid females were used to measure survival to adulthood with or without dye, in a habitat controlled to prevent further colonisation. The experiment was run twice, once in the summer and again in the autumn, whereas the dyes had no impact on emergence in the summer, there were highly significant reductions in emergence of adults in both dye treated habitats in the autumn. Containers with or without shadow dye were placed outside to colonise naturally and were sampled weekly for larvae and pupae over a 6 month period through summer and autumn. There was a significant negative effect of shadow dye on pupal abundance in a three week period over the summer, but otherwise there was no effect. It is likely that population abundance and food was a more powerful factor for mosquito survival than the dye.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>38533848</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Natali Ortiz-Perea, Rebecca Gander, Oliver Abbey, Amanda Callaghan&lt;/p&gt;

Swarm-founding wasps are endemic and common representatives of neotropical fauna and compose an interesting social tribe of vespids, presenting both complex social characteristics and uncommon traits for a eusocial group, such as the absence of castes with distinct morphology. The paper wasp &lt;i&gt;Protonectarina sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; (Saussure) presents a broad distribution from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, occurring widespread in the Atlantic rainforest and arboreal Caatinga, being absent in the Amazon region. Given the peculiar distribution among swarm-founding wasps, an integrative approach to reconstruct the evolutionary history of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; in a spatial-temporal framework was performed to investigate: the presence of genetic structure and its relationship with the geography, the evolution of distinct morphologic lineages and the possible historical event(s) in Neotropical region, which could explain the observed phylogeographic pattern. Individuals of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; were obtained from populations of 16 areas throughout its distribution for DNA extraction and amplification of mitochondrial genes 12S, 16S and COI. Analysis of genetic diversity, construction of haplotype net, analysis of population structure and dating analysis of divergence time were performed. A morphometric analysis was also performed using 8 measures of the body of the adult (workers) to test if there are morphological distinction among populations. Thirty-five haplotypes were identified, most of them exclusively of a group and a high population structure was found. The possibility of genetic divergence because of isolation by distance was rejected. Morphological analysis pointed to a great uniformity in phenotypes, with only a small degree of differentiation between populations of south and the remaining. Divergence time analysis showed a Middle/Late Miocene origin, a period where an extensive marine ingression occurred in South America.

&lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. are a leading cause of bacterial enteritis worldwide, including countries in Africa, and have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of the high priority antimicrobial resistant pathogens. However, at present there is little knowledge on the prevalence, molecular epidemiology or antimicrobial susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolates in Botswana, both in patients and in the zoonotic context. Some data indicate that ~14% of diarrhoeal disease cases in a paediatric setting can be ascribed to &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp., urging the need for the magnitude of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt;-associated diarrhoea to be established. In this survey, we have characterised the genomic diversity of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. circulating in Botswana isolated from cases of diarrhoeal disease in humans (n = 20) and from those that colonised commercial broiler (n = 35) and free-range (n = 35) chickens. Phylogeny showed that the &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from the different poultry and human sources were highly related, suggesting that zoonotic transmission has likely occurred. We found that for &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from humans, broilers and free-range chickens, 52% was positive for &lt;i&gt;tetO&lt;/i&gt;, 47% for &lt;i&gt;gyrA&lt;/i&gt;-T86I, 72% for &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA-61&lt;/sub&gt;, with 27% carrying all three resistance determinants. No 23S mutations conferring macrolide resistance were detected in this survey. In summary, our study provides insight into &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. in poultry reservoirs and in diarrhoeal patients, and the relevance for treatment regimens in Botswana.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>62f96647</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan P.

In summary, our study provides insight into &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. in poultry reservoirs and in diarrhoeal patients, and the relevance for treatment regimens in Botswana.</description><title>Phylogenetic analyses and antimicrobial resistance profiles of &amp;lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&amp;lt;/i&gt; spp. from diarrhoeal patients and chickens in Botswana</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087eb:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194481</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194481</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521666000000</published><author><name>Stefan P.

The microtubule associated protein tau plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that tau also plays a role in disorders of neuronal connectivity, including epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. Animal studies have shown that the MAPT gene, which codes for the tau protein, undergoes complex pre-mRNA alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms during brain development. Human data, particularly on temporal and regional variation in tau splicing during development are however lacking. In this study, we present the first detailed examination of the temporal and regional sequence of MAPT alternative splicing in the developing human brain. We used a novel computational analysis of large transcriptomic datasets (total n = 502 patients), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting to examine tau expression and splicing in post-mortem human fetal, pediatric and adult brains. We found that MAPT exons 2 and 10 undergo abrupt shifts in expression during the perinatal period that are unique in the canonical human microtubule-associated protein family, while exon 3 showed small but significant temporal variation. Tau isoform expression may be a marker of neuronal maturation, temporally correlated with the onset of axonal growth. Immature brain regions such as the ganglionic eminence and rhombic lip had very low tau expression, but within more mature regions, there was little variation in tau expression or splicing. We thus demonstrate an abrupt, evolutionarily conserved shift in tau isoform expression during the human perinatal period that may be due to tau expression in maturing neurons. Alternative splicing of the &lt;i&gt;MAPT&lt;/i&gt; pre-mRNA may play a vital role in normal brain development across multiple species and provides a basis for future investigations into the developmental and pathological functions of the tau protein.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a123f70e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marco M.

The speed of theta brain oscillatory activity is thought to play a key role in determining working memory (WM) capacity. Individual differences in the length of a theta cycle (ranging between 4 and 7 Hz) might determine how many gamma cycles (&gt;30 Hz) can be nested into a theta wave. Gamma cycles are thought to represent single memory items; therefore, this interplay could determine individual memory capacity. We directly tested this hypothesis by means of parietal transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) set at slower (4 Hz) and faster (7 Hz) theta frequencies during a visuospatial WM paradigm. Accordingly, we found that 4-Hz tACS enhanced WM capacity, while 7-Hz tACS reduced WM capacity. Notably, these effects were found only for items presented to the hemifield contralateral to the stimulation site. This provides causal evidence for a frequency-dependent and spatially specific organization of WM storage, supporting the theta–gamma phase coupling theory of WM capacity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CD9CmLoVDB8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>11c99faa</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nina Wolinski, Nicholas R.

We compared length of hospitalization, proportion of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length of stay, and 30- and 90-day mortality for adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An US commercial database of 38 million members from 1 November 2010 to 31 March 2014 was used to examine adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin (2,446), dabigatran (442), or rivaroxaban (256). Outcomes included difference in mean total length of hospitalization, proportion of ICU admissions, mean length of ICU stay, and all-cause 30- and 90-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Warfarin users were older and had more comorbidities. Multivariable regression modeling with propensity score weighting showed warfarin users were hospitalized 2.0 days longer (95% CI 1.8–2.3; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than dabigatran users and 2.6 days longer (95% CI 2.4–2.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. Dabigatran users were hospitalized 0.6 days longer (95% CI 0.2–1.0; p = 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in the proportion of ICU admissions. Among ICU admissions, warfarin users stayed 3.0 days (95% CI 1.9–3.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) longer than dabigatran users and 2.4 days longer (95% CI 0.9–3.7; p = 0.003) than rivaroxaban users. There was no difference in ICU stay between dabigatran and rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rivaroxaban and dabigatran were associated with shorter hospitalizations; however, there were no differences in 30- and 90-day mortality. These findings suggest bleeding associated with the newer agents is not more dangerous than bleeding associated with warfarin.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ae10a1fa</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Blake Charlton, Gboyega Adeboyeje, John J.

Human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (A3) proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases that catalyze the conversion of deoxycytidine (dC) to deoxyuridine (dU) in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis—for example, A3G deaminates the third dC in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy using the protection of telomeres protein 1 (Pot1) which has nanomolar affinity for ssDNA, with which we captured an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We crystallized a non-preferred adenine in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket of A3G. The structure reveals a unique conformation of the catalytic site loops that sheds light onto how the enzyme scans substrate in the -1 pocket. Furthermore, our biochemistry and virology studies provide evidence that the nucleotide-binding pockets on A3G influence each other in selecting the preferred DNA substrate. Together, the results provide insights into the mechanism by which A3G selects and deaminates its preferred substrates and help define how A3 proteins are tailored to recognize specific DNA sequences. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of DNA substrate selection by A3G, as well as A3G antiviral activity against HIV-1.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d1d1d7b7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samantha J.

When unifying genomic resources among studies and comparing data between species, there is often no better resource than a genome sequence. Having a reference genome for the Chinook salmon (&lt;i&gt;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&lt;/i&gt;) will enable the extensive genomic resources available for Pacific salmon, Atlantic salmon, and rainbow trout to be leveraged when asking questions related to the Chinook salmon. The Chinook salmon’s wide distribution, long cultural impact, evolutionary history, substantial hatchery production, and recent wild-population decline make it an important research species. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the genome of a Chilliwack River Hatchery female Chinook salmon (gynogenetic and homozygous at all loci). With a reference genome sequence, new questions can be asked about the nature of this species, and its role in a rapidly changing world.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>73fbc1ab</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kris A.

Compared with clopidogrel-naïve patients, chronic clopidogrel therapy patients were more likely to demonstrate clopidogrel poor responsiveness (66% versus 38%, p = 0.02), to be diabetic (52% versus 33%, p = 0.1) and to have multi-vessel coronary disease (79% versus 55%, p = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients sustaining acute coronary syndrome despite chronic clopidogrel therapy are more likely to exhibit inadequate platelet inhibition with clopidogrel.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Acute myocardial infarction occurring while on chronic clopidogrel therapy (‘clopidogrel failure’) is associated with high incidence of clopidogrel poor responsiveness and stent thrombosis</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd080:7c9981b6</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195504</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195504</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1523048400000</published><author><name>Ehud Regev</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1523036346876</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03755-2</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The beta secretase BACE1 regulates the expression of insulin receptor in the liver&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beta secretase BACE1 regulates the expression of insulin receptor in the liver, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03755-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03755-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A soluble form of insulin receptor in human plasma has been previously reported.

Black locust (&lt;i&gt;Robinia pseudoacacia&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an easy to raise, fast growing, medium-sized deciduous tree species highly tolerant to harsh eco-conditions, i.e., drought and harsh winters, and it is widely adaptable to sandy, loamy, and marshy soils. The basis for this adaptability remains to be investigated at the transcriptomic level using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Selection of a reliable gene for the normalization of qPCR data is important for obtaining accurate results in gene expression. The goal of this study was to identify an appropriate reference gene from 12 candidate genes for gene expression analysis in black locust exposed to various stressors such as abscisic acid (ABA), NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and varying temperatures. In GeNorm and NormFinder analyses, &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; (actin) and &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene expression were the most stable in all conditions except heat stress, but in BestKeeper analysis, &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;helicase&lt;/i&gt; gene expression were the most stable under NaCl and heat stress.

The KHB method is used to disentangle direct and indirect effects of early-life conditions on health.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Early-life-conditions indirectly impact on health in later life as result of their influence on education and family and employment trajectories. For example, between 22% and 42% of the effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Even higher percentages are found for men (35% - 57%). On the contrary, the positive effect of poor health at childhood on poor health at older ages is not significantly mediated by education and life-course trajectories. Education captures most of the mediating effect of parental socio-economic status. More specifically, between 66% and 75% of the indirect effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Again, higher percentages are found for men (86% - 93%). Early-life conditions, especially socioeconomic status, influence family and employment trajectories indirectly through their impact on education. We also find a persistent direct impact of early-life conditions on health at older ages.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate that early-life experiences influence education and life-course trajectories and health in later life, suggesting that public investments in children are expected to produce long lasting effects on people’s lives throughout the different phases of their life-course.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>90170977</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Arpino, Jordi Gumà, Albert Julià&lt;/p&gt;

We also find a persistent direct impact of early-life conditions on health at older ages.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate that early-life experiences influence education and life-course trajectories and health in later life, suggesting that public investments in children are expected to produce long lasting effects on people’s lives throughout the different phases of their life-course.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Early-life conditions and health at older ages: The mediating role of educational attainment, family and employment trajectories</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460c:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195320</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195320</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522962000000</published><author><name>Bruno Arpino</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522950125206</crawled></item><item><engagement>14</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23659-x</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23659-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23659-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/5l5B07YBkHY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>24f25669</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23659-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23659-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/5l5B07YBkHY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><title>Dynamic interaction of local and transhemispheric networks is necessary for progressive intensification of hippocampal seizures</title><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1628ff11fa6:9a1198a:34f43e70</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23659-x</link><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>683</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23659-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23659_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/5l5B07YBkHY/s41598-018-23659-x</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><published>1522825200000</published><author><name>Fredrik Berglind</name></author><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23659-x</href></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagementRate>0.47</engagementRate><crawled>1522833366950</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3864</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3864.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Regeneration of skeletal muscle in response to injury occurs through fusion of a population of stem cells, known as satellite cells, with injured myofibers.

Chronic constipation is a functional gastrointestinal disease that is detrimental to the quality of patient life. &lt;i&gt;Cassia obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; L. (CO) and &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; M. (FV) are commonly used as medicinal foods in many countries. We aimed to examine the laxative effect and their underlying mechanism of CO and FV mixture on loperamide (lop)-induced constipated rats. To determine the laxative effects of these compounds, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: the control, lop-induced constipated (2mg/kg), and three doses (100, 300, and 500mg/kg) of CO and FV mixture-, and Bisacodyl (bis, 3.3mg/kg)-treated groups. The mixture of CO and FV and bis were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks. For induction of constipation, the lop were treated with a dose of 2 mg/kg twice a day on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week after treatments of CO and FV extracts and bis. The results were revealed that the CO and FV mixture has the laxative effects more than those in CO and FV-alone treatments on constipated rats by determining the stool parameters, including stool number and weight. Indeed, stool parameters, such as, stool number, weight, and water contents and colonic peristalsis from the intestinal transit length and ratio were dramatically improved by CO and FV mixture treatment. Histological study also revealed that CO and FV mixture enhanced the thicknesses of mucosa and muscular layers of the colon in constipated rats. For their underlying mechanism, the mRNAs and proteins expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR) M2 and M3 and their downstream signaling were preserved by CO and FV mixture treatment in constipated rats. Therefore, this study suggests that treatment with CO and FV mixture has beneficial effects against constipation. We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>302f39ea</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Hee Jang, Dong Kwon Yang&lt;/p&gt;

By killing cattle and otherwise complicating management, the many species of larkspur (&lt;i&gt;Delphinium&lt;/i&gt; spp.) present a serious, intractable, and complex challenge to livestock grazing management in the western United States. Among the many obstacles to improving our understanding of cattle-larkspur dynamics has been the difficulty of testing different grazing management strategies in the field, as the risk of dead animals is too great. Agent-based models (ABMs) provide an effective method of testing alternate management strategies without risk to livestock. ABMs are especially useful for modeling complex systems such as livestock grazing management, and allow for realistic bottom-up encoding of cattle behavior. Here, we introduce a spatially-explicit, behavior-based ABM of cattle grazing in a pasture with a dangerous amount of Geyer’s larkspur (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;geyeri&lt;/i&gt;). This model tests the role of herd cohesion and stocking density in larkspur intake, finds that both are key drivers of larkspur-induced toxicosis, and indicates that alteration of these factors within realistic bounds can mitigate risk. Crucially, the model points to herd cohesion, which has received little attention in the discipline, as playing an important role in lethal acute toxicosis. As the first ABM to model grazing behavior at realistic scales, this study also demonstrates the tremendous potential of ABMs to illuminate grazing management dynamics, including fundamental aspects of livestock behavior amidst ecological heterogeneity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7f50e94d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin E.

While automated cell culture systems offer real-time monitoring and fine control over liquid cultures, they are difficult to scale to high-throughput, or require cumbersome redesign to meet diverse experimental requirements. Here we describe eVOLVER, a multipurpose, scalable DIY framework that can be easily configured to conduct a wide variety of growth fitness experiments at scale and cost. We demonstrate eVOLVER&apos;s versatility by configuring it for diverse growth and selection experiments that would be otherwise challenging for other systems. We conduct high-throughput evolution of yeast across different population density niches. We perform growth selection on a yeast knockout library under temporally varying temperature regimes.

While automated cell culture systems offer real-time monitoring and fine control over liquid cultures, they are difficult to scale to high-throughput, or require cumbersome redesign to meet diverse experimental requirements. Here we describe eVOLVER, a multipurpose, scalable DIY framework that can be easily configured to conduct a wide variety of growth fitness experiments at scale and cost.

Human protection policies require favorable risk–benefit judgments prior to launch of clinical trials. For phase I and II trials, evidence for such judgment often stems from preclinical efficacy studies (PCESs). We undertook a systematic investigation of application materials (investigator brochures [IBs]) presented for ethics review for phase I and II trials to assess the content and properties of PCESs contained in them. Using a sample of 109 IBs most recently approved at 3 institutional review boards based at German Medical Faculties between the years 2010–2016, we identified 708 unique PCESs. We then rated all identified PCESs for their reporting on study elements that help to address validity threats, whether they referenced published reports, and the direction of their results. Altogether, the 109 IBs reported on 708 PCESs. Less than 5% of all PCESs described elements essential for reducing validity threats such as randomization, sample size calculation, and blinded outcome assessment. For most PCESs (89%), no reference to a published report was provided. Only 6% of all PCESs reported an outcome demonstrating no effect. For the majority of IBs (82%), all PCESs were described as reporting positive findings. Our results show that most IBs for phase I/II studies did not allow evaluators to systematically appraise the strength of the supporting preclinical findings. The very rare reporting of PCESs that demonstrated no effect raises concerns about potential design or reporting biases. Poor PCES design and reporting thwart risk–benefit evaluation during ethical review of phase I/II studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Lvi8iDwsCE0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b9fd27d5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Wieschowski, William Wei Lim Chin, Carole Federico, Sören Sievers, Jonathan Kimmelman, Daniel Strech&lt;/p&gt;

Light and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition are among the important environmental factors influencing plant growth and forest regeneration. We used &lt;i&gt;Quercus acutissima&lt;/i&gt;, a dominant broadleaf tree species native to the deciduous forests of Northern China, to study the combined effects of light exposure and N addition on leaf physiology and individual plant growth. In the greenhouse, we exposed &lt;i&gt;Quercus acutissima&lt;/i&gt; seedlings to one of two light conditions (8% and 80% of full irradiation) and one of three N treatments (0, 6, and 12 g N m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). After 87 d, we observed that nitrogen deposition had no significant effects on the seedlings regardless of light exposure. In addition, shade significantly reduced plant height, basal diameter, leaf number, total biomass, gas exchange capacity, and carbohydrate content. In contrast, however, shade significantly increased the amount of photosynthetic pigment, above-ground biomass allocation, and specific leaf area. There was also a hierarchical plasticity among the different seedling characteristics. Compared to traits of growth, biomass, biomass allocation and leaf morphology, the leaf physiology, including photosynthetic pigment, gas exchange, carbohydrate, and PUNE, is more sensitive to light conditions. Among the biomass allocation parameters, the leaf and root mass ratios had a relatively low phenotypic plasticity. The seedlings had high foliar physiological plasticity under various light conditions. Nevertheless, we recommend high irradiance to maintain vigorous seedling growth and, in turn, promote the restoration and reconstruction of vegetation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>1336ad64</fingerprint><title>Nitrogen deposition does not affect the impact of shade on &amp;lt;i&gt;Quercus acutissima&amp;lt;/i&gt; seedlings</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d65:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mingyan Li, Weihua Guo, Ning Du, Zhenwei Xu, Xiao Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Tristan da Cunha Islands, an archipelago of four rocky volcanic islands situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and part of the United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), present a rare example of a relatively unimpacted temperate marine ecosystem. We conducted the first quantitative surveys of nearshore kelp forests, offshore pelagic waters and deep sea habitats. Kelp forests had very low biodiversity and species richness, but high biomass and abundance of those species present. Spatial variation in assemblage structure for both nearshore fish and invertebrates/algae was greatest between the three northern islands and the southern island of Gough, where sea temperatures were on average 3-4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; colder. Despite a lobster fishery that provides the bulk of the income to the Tristan islands, lobster abundance and biomass are comparable to or greater than many Marine Protected Areas in other parts of the world. Pelagic camera surveys documented a rich biodiversity offshore, including large numbers of juvenile blue sharks, &lt;i&gt;Prionace glauca&lt;/i&gt;. Species richness and abundance in the deep sea is positively related to hard rocky substrate and biogenic habitats such as sea pens, crinoids, whip corals, and gorgonians were present at 40% of the deep camera deployments. We observed distinct differences in the deep fish community above and below ~750 m depth. Concurrent oceanographic sampling showed a discontinuity in temperature and salinity at this depth. While currently healthy, Tristan’s marine ecosystem is not without potential threats: shipping traffic leading to wrecks and species introductions, pressure to increase fishing effort beyond sustainable levels and the impacts of climate change all could potentially increase in the coming years. The United Kingdom has committed to protection of marine environments across the UKOTs, including Tristan da Cunha and these results can be used to inform future management decisions as well as provide a baseline against which future monitoring can be based.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>505b6b33</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer E.

This should surprise no one at all, but it’s good to have some quantitative data on the problem. There are limitations to the study – for one thing, it’s quite possible that (self-selected) respondents were among those more likely to have experienced these problems. The survey was done across 26 different countries (over 2200 respondents), 70% female/28% male/2% transgender, and the fields of study involved were 56% humanities and 38% physical sciences – no breakdown of the numbers by these categories is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these reservations, I have no trouble believing the overall conclusions – based on my own experience and my observations since, I think that anxiety and depression are &lt;em&gt;very close to inevitable&lt;/em&gt; in graduate study, and that students should be aware of what they’re getting into. What’s happening, in any field, is the rubber finally meeting the road: you’re not just sitting in classrooms; you’re doing what practitioners of your chosen line of work actually do, and you’re finding out what that’s really like and whether or not you’re any good at it. If that doesn’t bring on the occasional bout of anxiety and self-doubt, then something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from that to depression is not such a huge jump, either. All of us who have been through grad school have seen people who sort of freeze up at some point in their progress. Sometimes it happens near the beginning, such as when chemistry graduate students move out of classes and into the labs – some of them just can’t seem to get anything going. I remember people who were always just about to start something, just about to figure out what went wrong with the last thing (which was spread out into a bunch of inconclusive samples around their hoods), just about to really start making some progress. But they never did. Later in the process, another familiar figure is the person who’s been hanging around for years in the lab, running ever more experiments to avoid writing up, as is their near-relative, the person who’s actually out of the lab, writing up that dissertation/thesis, expected to set a defense date pretty soon. . .and who in the end, is never heard from again after a while, finding themselves unable to get the thing done. After a while, the official notices from the department come back stamped “Addressee unknown”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression might well be a good description of what’s going on in many of these situations. Someone finds themselves in an untenable situation and sinks into a state that makes it more untenable every day. David Foster Wallace defined a harmful addiction as something that offered itself as the remedy for the problems that it itself was causing (as with alcohol), and the downward-spiral mode of life has some similarities, as a big factor in what put you into this spot makes you ever less likely to do anything about it. The canonical view of major depression from the inside is William Styron’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2pFf7lZ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darkness Visible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but you don’t have to be as far along as Styron was to be in real trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I got quite as far as depression myself, but there’s no doubt that I was under significant stress. Even the stock of stories that I have from grad school illustrates that. So many of them feature me losing my temper about something, and honestly, I rarely do that out here in the real world. I well recall unnerving bouts of fear and uncertainty, wondering if I was doing the right thing with my life, wondering if it was too late to do much about that even if I were, wondering if my research was any good or if I was any good at doing it, and what I was going to do about it if the answer to either or both of those were actually “No”. And so on. By the end of it, I was thoroughly sick of my project, wildly ready to get out the door and see what the post-doc life was going to be like (and very much wondering if it would turn out to be more of the same, in a different location).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw some outright breakdowns while I was in grad school – there’s no other way to describe them. In some cases a person’s hours and behavior would become erratic, their actions hard to understand or predict. Sometimes in these the ship would apparently right itself and sometimes it wouldn’t. I saw examples of just those situations mentioned above, with people unable to make a real start in research or unable to write up at the end of it. And there was one flat-out suicide attempt, very nearly successful and permanently damaging to the person involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my own worst moments, I would be standing there in the lab feeling like a pitcher out on the mound who had just shaken off every pitch he knew how to throw. I was hauling material up the mountainside of a long linear synthesis, and I was frustrated to a degree beyond anything I’d ever experienced. I didn’t feel like working up the reactions in front of me, and I didn’t feel like setting up others. Waiting for me was my reward at the end of twenty-odd linear steps, the chance to risk all my hard work by trying (finally) some new chemistry that would probably not work and might well destroy my starting material in the process. Oh joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve told this next story before, but can’t track down the post where I did. At any rate, a pivotal moment was when I was bashing along with the largest load of starting material I’d ever made. Up at around step 9 (I was still in liter-sized flask territory) I was ready to work up the whole batch after a late-night reaction. I added some ammonium chloride and extracted the black mixture. That didn’t worry me; it was always black. I evaporated it down to a bunch of black oil and loaded it on a big gravity column of coarse silica gel – from prior runs, I knew that would hold the black crud at the top and allow a big yellow band of product to elute. Except this time the whole column turned black. Must have overloaded the column with this big pile of material, I thought. I collected a bunch of black fractions and rota-vapped them down, only to find what I sort of thought was a lot less oil than I’d been expecting. Reserving worry, I set up another column on that stuff, and this time the whole column turned black again, and nothing at all came out the other end but slightly discolored solvent. I had, in fact, destroyed my entire huge batch, because at 2 AM I was too groggy to remember that I was supposed to work it up with saturated bicarb, not ammonium chloride. All gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood there, alone, in the middle of the night, looking at all the mess I’d created. Ruined, all that batch of material that was going to finally get my synthesis finished and get me out of this place. I shook my head, cursed loudly, and went home, and to my surprise I fell asleep fairly quickly. What else was there to do? I woke up the next morning and went through that terrible disorienting feeling when after a few seconds you suddenly remember that something bad happened the night before. And then I got up and went to the lab, and set up an even larger batch back at the beginning of the synthesis, step one. Looking back, that night and that morning were a key episode in my graduate career and my life in general, because that batch I started that next day really did get me out in the end. I had bent and come very close to breaking at times, but it turned out that the worst had happened and I was still in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things definitely could have gone in other ways, though, and if they had there’s no telling where I would be now or what I would be doing. If that incident had happened to me a year before, I don’t know how I would have taken it. By the time I speak of, I had my eyes on the door and a PhD defense, having decided that the shortest way out of this awful situation was in that direction. I was devoting all my efforts to it, in an “OK, did today get me closer to defending, or not?” sort of way. Earlier, though, I was too far from the beginning and too far from the end to have that mindset, and a whopping failure would not have gone down well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important for graduate students to realize that &lt;em&gt;everyone has these doubts and bad stretches&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone has these moments when they wonder what they’ve done to their lives, but having these thoughts is &lt;em&gt;not a sign&lt;/em&gt; that the exact failure you’re fearing has arrived. That doesn’t mean that thinking about your purpose in grad school is a bad thing, but it probably is a bad thing to try to do it at periods of peak emotional stress. If you feel that it really is getting too much, definitely talk to someone. Universities have people around for just that purpose – more so than in my day, fortunately – and if you find yourself wondering if you should reach out like that, then odds are that you should. Do it. I wish some of the people I worked with had, or had been able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any meaningful graduate degree is going to be a test of your abilities and your resilience. Recognize this, and avoid the two extremes. On one end are the macho types whose response is “Eat stress for breakfast! That’s what I did in my day! If you don’t have the fire in your belly you don’t belong here!”. And on the other end are the voices, some perhaps external and some internal, telling you that you’re a failure already, an imposter, and that you’re never going to measure up anyway. These are two different sets of lies, and everyone has to steer their course between them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2809f37c</fingerprint><description>According to this new survey, depression and anxiety are far more common among graduate students than in the general population.

We demonstrate the resulting discovery of novel genes, isoforms and structural variants, even in genomes as well studied as rat and great ape, and how these annotations improve cross-species RNA expression experiments.</description><title>Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT) - simultaneous clade and personal genome annotation [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16277e48cc3:7a29f81:7d6c1c1c</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231118v3?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231118v3?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><published>1522393200000</published><author><name>Fiddes, I.

It is postulated that the G223R mutation may be a consequence of the drug resistant Southeast Asian Dd2 genotype becoming more dominant in Africa. The presence of this mutation has important policy implications for the eventual general deployment ofthe Spiroindolone KAE609 (Cipargamin) which is currently undergoing stage 2 clinical trials.</description><title>P. falciparum PfATP4 Multi-Drug Resistance to KAE609 (Cipargamin) is Present in Africa [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16287c4653f:8cee8de:7d6c1c1c</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293035v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293035v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><published>1522652400000</published><author><name>McCulloch, J.</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522696217919</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194283</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194283</originId><updated>1521493200000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alison M.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To provide evidence for quantitative magnetic resonance (qMR) biomarkers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy by investigating the relationship between qMR measures of lower extremity muscle pathology and functional endpoints in a large ambulatory cohort using a multicenter study design.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;MR spectroscopy and quantitative imaging were implemented to measure intramuscular fat fraction and the transverse magnetization relaxation time constant (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in lower extremity muscles of 136 participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Measures were collected at 554 visits over 48 months at one of three imaging sites. Fat fraction was measured in the soleus and vastus lateralis using MR spectroscopy, while T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was assessed using MRI in eight lower extremity muscles. Ambulatory function was measured using the 10m walk/run, climb four stairs, supine to stand, and six minute walk tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significant correlations were found between all qMR and functional measures. Vastus lateralis qMR measures correlated most strongly to functional endpoints (|ρ| = 0.68–0.78), although measures in other rapidly progressing muscles including the biceps femoris (|ρ| = 0.63–0.73) and peroneals (|ρ| = 0.59–0.72) also showed strong correlations. Quantitative MR biomarkers were excellent indicators of loss of functional ability and correlated with qualitative measures of function.

Industry-driven voluntary disease control programs for swine diseases emerged in North America in the early 2000’s, and, since then, those programs have been used for monitoring diseases of economic importance to swine producers. One example of such initiatives is Dr. Morrison’s Swine Health Monitoring Project, a nation-wide monitoring program for swine diseases including the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRS has been extensively reported as a seasonal disease in the U.S., with predictable peaks that start in fall and are extended through the winter season. However, formal time series analysis stratified by geographic region has never been conducted for this important disease across the U.S. The main objective of this study was to use approximately seven years of PRRS incidence data in breeding swine herds to conduct time-series analysis in order to describe the temporal patterns of PRRS outbreaks at the farm level for five major swine-producing states across the U.S. including the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Carolina, Nebraska and Illinois. Data was aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus. Basic descriptive statistics were conducted followed by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling, conducted separately for each of the above-mentioned states. Results showed that there was a difference in the nature of PRRS seasonality among states. Of note, when comparing states, the typical seasonal pattern previously described for PRRS could only be detected for farms located in the states of Minnesota, North Carolina and Nebraska. For the other two states, seasonal peaks every six months were detected within a year. In conclusion, we showed that epidemic patterns are not homogeneous across the U.S, with major peaks of disease occurring through the year. These findings highlight the importance of coordinating alternative control strategies in different regions considering the prevailing epidemiological patterns.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>bb03bce4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andréia Gonçalves Arruda, Carles Vilalta, Pere Puig, Andres Perez, Anna Alba&lt;/p&gt;

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an incurable and rare hereditary syndrome. In recent times, treatment with glucocorticoid analogues has been shown to improve the neurological symptoms that characterize this condition, but the molecular mechanism of action of these analogues remains unknown. Hence, the aim of this study was to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of action of glucocorticoid analogues in the treatment of A-T by investigating the role of Dexamethasone (Dexa) in A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines. We used 2DE and tandem MS to identify proteins that were influenced by the drug in A-T cells but not in healthy cells. Thirty-four proteins were defined out of a total of 746±63. Transcriptome analysis was performed by microarray and showed the differential expression of 599 A-T and 362 wild type (WT) genes and a healthy un-matching between protein abundance and the corresponding gene expression variation. The proteomic and transcriptomic profiles allowed the network pathway analysis to pinpoint the biological and molecular functions affected by Dexamethasone in Dexa-treated cells. The present integrated study provides evidence of the molecular mechanism of action of Dexamethasone in an A-T cellular model but also the broader effects of the drug in other tested cell lines.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>622b1adb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michele Menotta, Sara Orazi, Anna Maria Gioacchini, Chiara Spapperi, Anastasia Ricci, Luciana Chessa, Mauro Magnani&lt;/p&gt;

The human amniotic membrane (HAM) is widely used for its wound healing effect in clinical practice, as a feeder for the cell cultivation, or a source of cells to be used in cell therapy. The aim of this study was to find effective and safe enzymatic HAM de-epithelialization method leading to harvesting of both denuded undamaged HAM and viable human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs). The efficiency of de-epithelialization using TrypLE Express, trypsin/ ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), and thermolysin was monitored by hematoxylin and eosin staining and by the measurement of DNA concentration. The cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. Scanning electron microscopy and immunodetection of collagen type IV and laminin α5 chain were used to check the basement membrane integrity. De-epithelialized hAECs were cultured and their stemness properties and proliferation potential was assessed after each passage. The HAM was successfully de-epithelialized using all three types of reagents, but morphological changes in basement membrane and stroma were observed after the thermolysin application. About 60% of cells remained viable using trypsin/EDTA, approximately 6% using TrypLE Express, and all cells were lethally damaged after thermolysin application. The hAECs isolated using trypsin/EDTA were successfully cultured up to the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; passage with increasing proliferation potential and decreased stem cell markers expression (&lt;i&gt;NANOG&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOX2&lt;/i&gt;) in prolonged cell culture.

The hAECs isolated using trypsin/EDTA were successfully cultured up to the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; passage with increasing proliferation potential and decreased stem cell markers expression (&lt;i&gt;NANOG&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOX2&lt;/i&gt;) in prolonged cell culture. Trypsin/EDTA technique was the most efficient for obtaining both undamaged denuded HAM and viable hAECs for consequent culture.</description><title>The enzymatic de-epithelialization technique determines denuded amniotic membrane integrity and viability of harvested epithelial cells</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f10:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194820</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194820</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522184400000</published><author><name>Peter Trosan</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522172707031</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32323</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Genomics and Evolutionary Biology</item></keywords><title>An incoherent feedforward loop facilitates adaptive tuning of gene expression</title><summary><content>We studied adaptive evolution of gene expression using long-term experimental evolution of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; in ammonium-limited chemostats.

Meta-research is the study of research itself: its methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives. Given that science is the key driver of human progress, improving the efficiency of scientific investigation and yielding more credible and more useful research results can translate to major benefits. The research enterprise grows very fast. Both new opportunities for knowledge and innovation and new threats to validity and scientific integrity emerge. Old biases abound, and new ones continuously appear as novel disciplines emerge with different standards and challenges. Meta-research uses an interdisciplinary approach to study, promote, and defend robust science. Major disruptions are likely to happen in the way we pursue scientific investigation, and it is important to ensure that these disruptions are evidence based.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oooAXQ5WXhg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>cd6c5bbd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by John P.

Investigating cerebral metabolism &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; at a microscopic level is essential for understanding brain function and its pathological alterations. The intricate signaling and metabolic dynamics between neurons, glia, and microvasculature requires much more detailed understanding to better comprehend the mechanisms governing brain function and its disease-related changes. We recently demonstrated that pharmacologically-induced alterations to different steps of cerebral metabolism can be distinguished utilizing 2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of endogenous reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we evaluate the ability of the phasor analysis method to identify these pharmacological metabolic alterations and compare the method’s performance with more conventional nonlinear curve-fitting analysis. Visualization of phasor data, both at the fundamental laser repetition frequency and its second harmonic, enables resolution of pharmacologically-induced alterations to mitochondrial metabolic processes from baseline cerebral metabolism. Compared to our previous classification models based on nonlinear curve-fitting, phasor–based models required fewer parameters and yielded comparable or improved classification accuracy. Fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH and phasor analysis shows utility for detecting metabolic alterations and will lead to a deeper understanding of cerebral energetics and its pathological changes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7d361b0f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Current South African health policy for chronic disease management proposes integration of chronic services for better outcomes for chronic conditions; that is based on the Integrated Chronic Disease Model (ICDM). However, scant data exist on how patients with chronic multimorbidities currently experience the (re)-organisation of health services and what their perceived needs are in order to enhance the management of their conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A qualitative study was conducted in a community health centre treating both HIV and diabetes patients in Cape Town. The study was grounded in the Shippee&apos;s Cumulative Complexity Model (CCM) and explored “patient workload” and “patient capacity” to manage chronic conditions. Individual interviews were conducted with 10 adult patient-participants with HIV and type two diabetes (T2D) multimorbidity and 6 healthcare workers who provided health services to these patient-participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patient-participants in this study experienced clinic-related workload such as: two separate clinics for HIV and T2D and perceived and experienced power mismatch between patients and healthcare workers. Self-care related workloads were largely around nutritional requirements, pill burden, and stigma.

Background &lt;p&gt;Current South African health policy for chronic disease management proposes integration of chronic services for better outcomes for chronic conditions; that is based on the Integrated Chronic Disease Model (ICDM). However, scant data exist on how patients with chronic multimorbidities currently experience the (re)-organisation of health services and what their perceived needs are in order to enhance the management of their conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A qualitative study was conducted in a community health centre treating both HIV and diabetes patients in Cape Town. The study was grounded in the Shippee&apos;s Cumulative Complexity Model (CCM) and explored “patient workload” and “patient capacity” to manage chronic conditions. Individual interviews were conducted with 10 adult patient-participants with HIV and type two diabetes (T2D) multimorbidity and 6 healthcare workers who provided health services to these patient-participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patient-participants in this study experienced clinic-related workload such as: two separate clinics for HIV and T2D and perceived and experienced power mismatch between patients and healthcare workers. Self-care related workloads were largely around nutritional requirements, pill burden, and stigma. Burden of these demands varied in difficulty among patient-participants due to capacity factors such as: positive attitudes, optimal health literacy, social support and availability of economic resources. Strategies mentioned by participants for improved continuity of care and self-management of multi-morbidities included integration of chronic services, consolidated guidelines for healthcare workers, educational materials for patients, improved information systems and income for patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Using the CCM to explore multimorbidity captured most of the themes around &amp;quot;patient workload&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;patient capacity”, and was thus a suitable framework to explore multimorbidity in this high HIV/T2D burden setting. Integration of chronic services and addressing social determinants of health may be the first steps towards alleviating patient burden and improving their access and utilisation of these services. Further studies are necessary to explore multimorbidity beyond the context of HIV/T2D.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>A qualitative study on the experiences and perspectives of public sector patients in Cape Town in managing the workload of demands of HIV and type 2 diabetes multimorbidity</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cfa06:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194191</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194191</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521061200000</published><author><name>Rangarirai Matima</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521049501222</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195526</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195526</originId><updated>1522875600000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Volodymyr Gerzanich, Min Seong Kwon, Seung Kyoon Woo, Alexander Ivanov, J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke, is linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is characterized by SUR1-TRPM4 (sulfonylurea receptor 1—transient receptor potential melastatin 4) channel upregulation in microvascular endothelium. In humans and rodents with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), the SUR1 antagonist, glibenclamide, reduces hemorrhagic transformation and plasma MMP-9, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that tPA induces protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-mediated, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium, and that SUR1-TRPM4 is required for this process.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R, of 2 and 4 hours duration, respectively, was obtained using conventional middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunolabeling was used to quantify p65 nuclear translocation. Murine and human brain endothelial cells (BEC) were studied &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, without and with NF-κB activation, using immunoblot, zymography and ELISA, patch clamp electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations were used to identify signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R caused prominent nuclear translocation of p65 in microvascular endothelium. NF-κB-activation of BEC caused &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; expression of SUR1-TRPM4 channels. In NF-κB-activated BEC: (i) tPA caused opening of SUR1-TRPM4 channels in a plasmin-, PAR1-, TRPC3- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner; (ii) tPA caused PAR1-dependent secretion of MMP-9; (iii) tonic secretion of MMP-9 by activated BEC was not influenced by SUR1 inhibition; (iv) phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA or the PAR1-agonist, TFLLR, required functional SUR1-TRPM4 channels, with inhibition of SUR1 decreasing tPA-induced MMP-9 secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;tPA induces PAR1-mediated, SUR1-TRPM4-dependent, phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c656222e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Volodymyr Gerzanich, Min Seong Kwon, Seung Kyoon Woo, Alexander Ivanov, J.

Single-trial analyses have the potential to uncover meaningful brain dynamics that are obscured when averaging across trials. However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75 Hz to 95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55 Hz to 125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oy2L5cnKlBc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e8e624d3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Britta U.

In the present study, we examined the effects of different drying conditions on the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages. We approached this objective by comparing invertebrate assemblages in perennial and intermittent sites along two intermittent Mediterranean streams with contrasting predictability, duration, and spatial patterns of drying: Fuirosos (high predictability, short duration, downstream drying pattern) and Rogativa (low predictability, long duration, patchy drying pattern). Specifically, we quantified the contribution of individual taxa to those differences, the degree of nestedness, and shifts in the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages along flow intermittence gradients. We observed greater effects of drying on the benthic invertebrate composition in Fuirosos than in Rogativa, resulting in a higher dissimilarity of assemblages between perennial and intermittent sites, as well as a lower degree of nestedness. Furthermore, a higher number of biotic metrics related to richness, abundance and biological traits were significantly different between perennial and intermittent sites in Fuirosos, despite a shorter dry period compared to Rogativa. At the same time, slightly different responses were detected during post-drying (autumn) than pre-drying (spring) conditions in this stream. In Rogativa, shifts in benthic invertebrate assemblages along increasing gradients of flow intermittence were found for three metrics (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) and Odonata, Coleoptera and Heteroptera (OCH) abundances and aerial active dispersal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combined gradients of dry period duration and distance to nearest perennial reach can generate complex, and different, responses of benthic invertebrate assemblages, depending on the flow intermittence metric. Our study advances the notion that special attention should be paid to the predictability, duration and spatial patterns of drying in intermittent streams in order to disentangle the effects of drying on benthic invertebrate assemblages, in particular in areas subject to high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in drying conditions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2ad5a22a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by María Mar Sánchez-Montoya, Daniel von Schiller, Gonzalo G.

Cabbage (&lt;i&gt;Brassica oleracea&lt;/i&gt; L. var. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt;), an important vegetable crop in the Brassicaceae family, is economically important worldwide. In the process of hybrid seed production, Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (OguCMS), controlled by the mitochondrial gene &lt;i&gt;orf138&lt;/i&gt;, has been extensively used for cabbage hybrid production with complete and stable male sterility. To identify the critical genes and pathways involved in the sterility and to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, the anther of OguCMS line R2P2CMS and the fertile line R2P2 were used for RNA-seq and iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) proteome analysis. RNA-seq analysis generated 13,037,109 to 13,066,594 SE50-clean reads, from the sterile and fertile lines, which were assembled into 36,890 unigenes. Among them, 1,323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, consisting of 307 up- and 1016 down-regulated genes. For ITRAQ analysis, a total of 7,147 unique proteins were identified, and 833 were differentially expressed including 538 up- and 295 down-regulated proteins. These were mainly annotated to the ribosome, spliceosome and mRNA surveillance pathways. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified 22 and 70 genes with the same and opposite expression profiles, respectively. Using KEGG analysis of DEGs, gibberellin mediated signaling pathways regulating tapetum programmed cell death and four different pathways involved in sporopollenin synthesis were identified. Secretion and translocation of the sporopollenin precursors were identified, and the key genes participating in these pathways were all significantly down-regulated in R2P2CMS. Light and transmission electron (TE) microscopy revealed fat abnormal tapetum rather than vacuolization and degradation at the tetrad and microspore stages of the OguCMS line. This resulted in the failed deposition of sporopollenin on the pollen resulting in sterility. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism underlying OguCMS in cabbage.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>44d66f7b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Miaomiao Xing, Chao Sun, Hailong Li, Shilin Hu, Lei Lei, Jungen Kang&lt;/p&gt;

Here we conducted a retrospective analysis of hospital-based trauma registry database for evaluating the impacts of comorbidities on the prognosis for traumatized patients using Index of Coexistent Comorbidity Disease (ICED) scores. We analyzed the data of patients with blunt trauma who visited emergency department between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2015 in Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung branch, a single level I trauma center in the Northern Taiwan. All consecutive patients with blunt trauma who admitted to the intensive care unit or ordinary ward after initial managements in the emergency department were included. We measured the hospital mortality of blunt traumatized patients using alive discharge as a competing risk. To investigate conditional independence of mortality and ICED scores given Injury Severity Score (ISS), we used log-linear models for modeling independence structures. Overall, we included 4997 patients (median age [IQR], 59 years old (44–75 years); 55.3% male). The mortality rate of blunt traumatized patients was higher in the higher ICED scores group compared to lower ICED scores group (4.7% vs 1.8%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Meanwhile, the higher ICED scores group were associated with older age, higher ISS, and longer hospital stay than lower ICED scores group. Higher ICED group had higher probability of transition-to-death and lower probability of transition-to-discharge under the competing risk model. In the multivariable analysis of transition-specific Cox models, higher ICED group were associated with higher risk for hospital mortality compared to lower ICED group (HR 1.60; [95% CI 1.04–2.47]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.032). Also, higher ICED group were associated with lower probability of transition-to-discharge (HR 0.79; [95%CI 0.73–0.86]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Additionally, higher ICED scores accounted for hospital mortality among patients with ISS &amp;lt; 25. In conclusion, our study suggested that severity of comorbidity was associated with higher hospital mortality among traumatized patients, particularly lower ISS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>40ed9292</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chih-Yuan Wang, Yi-Chan Chen, Ti-Hsuan Chien, Hao-Yu Chang, Yu-Hsien Chen, Chih-Ying Chien, Ting-Shuo Huang&lt;/p&gt;
Here we conducted a retrospective analysis of hospital-based trauma registry database for evaluating the impacts of comorbidities on the prognosis for traumatized patients using Index of Coexistent Comorbidity Disease (ICED) scores. We analyzed the data of patients with blunt trauma who visited emergency department between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2015 in Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung branch, a single level I trauma center in the Northern Taiwan. All consecutive patients with blunt trauma who admitted to the intensive care unit or ordinary ward after initial managements in the emergency department were included. We measured the hospital mortality of blunt traumatized patients using alive discharge as a competing risk. To investigate conditional independence of mortality and ICED scores given Injury Severity Score (ISS), we used log-linear models for modeling independence structures. Overall, we included 4997 patients (median age [IQR], 59 years old (44–75 years); 55.3% male). The mortality rate of blunt traumatized patients was higher in the higher ICED scores group compared to lower ICED scores group (4.7% vs 1.8%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Meanwhile, the higher ICED scores group were associated with older age, higher ISS, and longer hospital stay than lower ICED scores group. Higher ICED group had higher probability of transition-to-death and lower probability of transition-to-discharge under the competing risk model. In the multivariable analysis of transition-specific Cox models, higher ICED group were associated with higher risk for hospital mortality compared to lower ICED group (HR 1.60; [95% CI 1.04–2.47]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.032). Also, higher ICED group were associated with lower probability of transition-to-discharge (HR 0.79; [95%CI 0.73–0.86]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Additionally, higher ICED scores accounted for hospital mortality among patients with ISS &amp;lt; 25. In conclusion, our study suggested that severity of comorbidity was associated with higher hospital mortality among traumatized patients, particularly lower ISS.</description><title>Impact of comorbidities on the prognoses of trauma patients: Analysis of a hospital-based trauma registry database</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37c0:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194749</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194749</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521579600000</published><author><name>Chih-Yuan Wang</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521567726732</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2528</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2528.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>The mechanisms underlying analgesia related to social touch are not clear.

Background &lt;p&gt;This study explored spatial-temporal variation in diagnoses of gonorrhoea to identify and quantify endemic areas and clusters in relation to patient characteristics and outcomes of partner notification (PN) across England, UK.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Endemic areas and clusters were identified using a two-stage analysis with Kulldorff’s scan statistics (SaTScan).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2,571,838 tests, 53,547 diagnoses were gonorrhoea positive (positivity = 2.08%). The proportion of diagnoses in heterosexual males was 1.5 times that in heterosexual females. Among index cases, men who have sex with men (MSM) were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with gonorrhoea than heterosexual males (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity and deprivation rank, 4 endemic areas were identified including 11,047 diagnoses, 86% of which occurred in London. 33 clusters included 17,629 diagnoses (34% of total diagnoses in 2012 and 2013) and spanned 21 locations, some of which were dominated by heterosexually acquired infection, whilst others were MSM focused. Of the 53,547 diagnoses, 14.5% (7,775) were the result of PN. The proportion of patients who attended services as a result of PN varied from 0% to 61% within different age, gender and sexual orientation cohorts. A third of tests resulting from PN were positive for gonorrhoea. 25% of Local Authorities (n = 81, 95% CI: 20.2, 29.5) had a higher than expected proportion for female PN diagnoses as compared to 16% for males (n = 52, 95% CI: 12.0, 19.9).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The English gonorrhoea epidemic is characterised by spatial-temporal variation. PN success varied between endemic areas and clusters. Greater emphasis should be placed on the role of PN in the control of gonorrhoea to reduce the risk of onward transmission, re-infection, and complications of infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>86d9427a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allen O’Brien, Ellie Sherrard-Smith, Bersabeh Sile, Charlotte Watts, Ian Simms&lt;/p&gt;

Greater emphasis should be placed on the role of PN in the control of gonorrhoea to reduce the risk of onward transmission, re-infection, and complications of infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Spatial clusters of gonorrhoea in England with particular reference to the outcome of partner notification: 2012 and 2013</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76927:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195178</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195178</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522702800000</published><author><name>Allen O’Brien</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522690928501</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3145</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3145.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>The eukaryotic plasma membrane is compartmentalized into domains enriched in specific lipids and proteins.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite decades of efforts to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) in the United States (US), TB still contributes to adverse ill health, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2016, about 87% of the TB cases reported in the US were among racial and ethnic minorities. The objective of this study is to explore the risks for pregnancy complications and in-hospital death among mothers diagnosed with TB across racial/ethnic groups in the US.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized National Inpatient Sample data for all inpatient hospital discharges in the US. We analyzed pregnancy-related hospitalizations and births in the US from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2014 (n = 57,393,459). Multivariable logistic regression was applied to generate odds ratios for the association between TB status and the primary study outcomes (i.e., pregnancy complications and in-hospital death) across racial/ethnic categories.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of TB was 7.1 per 100,000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations. The overall prevalence of pregnancy complications was 80% greater among TB-infected mothers than their uninfected counterparts. Severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, placenta previa, post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis and anemia occurred with greater frequency among mothers with a TB diagnosis than those without TB, irrespective of race/ethnicity. The rate of in-hospital death among TB patients was 37 times greater among TB-infected than in non-TB infected mothers (468.8 per 100,000 versus 12.6 per 100,000). A 3-fold increased risk of in-hospital death was observed among black TB-negative mothers compared to their white counterparts. No racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity or in-hospital death were found among mothers with TB disease.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;TB continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women in the US. Resources to address TB disease should also target pregnant women, especially racial/ethnic minorities who bear the greatest burden of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>40657a59</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erika M.

Several multiple-media culture systems have become commercially available for on-farm identification of mastitis-associated pathogens. However, the accuracy of these systems has not been thoroughly and independently validated against microbiological evaluations performed by referral laboratories. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the performance of commercially available culture plates (Accumast, Minnesota Easy System, SSGN and SSGNC Quad plates) to identify pathogens associated with clinical mastitis in dairy cows. Milk samples from the affected quarter with clinical mastitis were aerobically cultured with the on-farm culture systems and by two additional reference laboratories. Agreeing results from both standard laboratories were denoted as the reference standard (RS). Accuracy (Ac), sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) and Cohen’s kappa coefficient (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;) of on-farm plates were determined based on the RS culture of 211 milk samples. All four plate-systems correctly identified ≥ 84.9% of milk samples with no bacterial growth. Accumast had greater values for all overall predictive factors (Ac, Se, Sp, PPV and NPV) and a substantial agreement (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 0.79) with RS. The inter-rater agreements of Minnesota, SSGN, and SSGNC with RS were moderate (0.45 ≤ &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.55). The effectiveness to categorize bacterial colonies at the genus and species was numerically different amongst the commercial plates. Our findings suggest that Accumast was the most accurate on-farm culture system for identification of mastitis-associated pathogens of the four systems included in the analysis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7537487f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jair C.

Adherent cells sense the physical properties of their environment via focal adhesions. Improved understanding of how cells sense and response to their physical surroundings is aided by quantitative evaluation of focal adhesion size, number, orientation, and distribution in conjunction with the morphology of single cells and the corresponding nuclei. We developed a fast, user-friendly and automated image analysis algorithm capable of capturing and characterizing these individual components with a high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the algorithm by quantifying morphological changes in response to a variety of environmental changes as well as manipulations of cellular components of mechanotransductions. Finally, as a proof-of-concept we use our algorithm to quantify the effect of Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y-27632 on focal adhesion maturation. We show that a decrease in cell contractility leads to a decrease in focal adhesion size and aspect ratio.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ada0773f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antonetta B.

Various sociocultural factors affect healthcare-seeking behaviors. In Taiwanese society, superstitions and lunar festivals play important roles in people’s lives. We investigated the impact of “Ghost Month” (the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month) and Chinese New Year (the 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month and the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month of the following year) on the number of elective surgeries and emergent surgeries in Taiwan. The number of total knee replacement (TKR) surgeries and proximal femur fracture (PFF) surgeries in each lunar month from 2000 to 2011 were extracted from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, a computerized and population-based database.

Various sociocultural factors affect healthcare-seeking behaviors. In Taiwanese society, superstitions and lunar festivals play important roles in people’s lives. We investigated the impact of “Ghost Month” (the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month) and Chinese New Year (the 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month and the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month of the following year) on the number of elective surgeries and emergent surgeries in Taiwan. The number of total knee replacement (TKR) surgeries and proximal femur fracture (PFF) surgeries in each lunar month from 2000 to 2011 were extracted from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, a computerized and population-based database. Patients were then sorted by location of residence or gender. The average number of TKR surgeries performed was significantly lower during the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months in urban areas, whereas in rural areas this trend was only evident in the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months. There was however, no significant difference in the average number of PFF surgeries in each lunar month except for an increase seen in the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month in rural patients (p&amp;lt;0.05). When sorted by gender, the average number of TKR surgeries was significantly decreased in the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months in male patients, and decreased in the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months in female patients. In contrast, there was no difference in the average numbers of PFF surgeries in the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months either in male or female patients. We proposed that the timing of elective surgeries such as TKR might be influenced by Ghost Month and Chinese New Year; however, emergent PFF surgeries were not significantly influenced by sociocultural beliefs and taboos in Taiwan.</description><title>The sociocultural effects on orthopedic surgeries in Taiwan</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde27:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195183</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195183</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522357200000</published><author><name>Shin-Lin Chiu</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522346229745</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2673</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Letters, Sustainability Science</item></keywords><content><content>Tregidgo et al.

The theory has been that these are always going to be in there fighting against your efforts to kill off the downstream tumor cells, so unless you find a way to target them, you’re not going to be successful. As that blog post shows, though, this area was imperfectly understood at the time, and it has not gotten a great deal more clear since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company that I wrote about, though, Stemcentrx, was &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/04/28/stemcentrx-scooped-up&quot;&gt;bought a few months later&lt;/a&gt; by AbbVie for &lt;em&gt;5.8 billion dollars in cash&lt;/em&gt; (and promises of about four billion more if things worked out). At the time, I wrote (uncontroversially, I think) that “this deal is going to end up looking either very smart or very stupid”. The lead program out of this deal, Rova-T, is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4934375/&quot;&gt;antibody-drug&lt;/a&gt; conjugate (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovalpituzumab_tesirine&quot;&gt;rovalpituzumab tesirine&lt;/a&gt;) which was aimed at small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), specifically the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL3&quot;&gt;DLL3&lt;/a&gt; protein found on the surface of some cell types. The antibody targets DLL, and the conjugate has a cleavable linker that delivers a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer as a DNA-damaging payload. SCLC is bad news, so any advances in this field would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on in 2016, AbbVie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/abbvie-turns-its-first-card-bold-10b-gamble-rova-t&quot;&gt;presented data&lt;/a&gt; from a small trial (I believe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(16)30565-4/fulltext&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) that showed that response rates did seem to correlate with DLL3 expression. But the rates themselves were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2016/06/05/abbvies-new-lung-cancer-drug-may-extend-patients-lives-but-could-disappoint-investors/#64bce5bf7c53&quot;&gt;not all that impressive&lt;/a&gt;, in the larger scheme of things, and overall, people didn’t seem very impressed. AbbVie pushed on, though, seeking accelerated approval from the FDA, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/abbvie-shares-tank-on-rova-t-flop-retreat-from-accelerated-approval-pitch/&quot;&gt;today we have the latest results&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately. The company reported the response rate from the DLL3-high patient group, and it’s only 16% (which is the same or worse than standard of care response rates), and the survival data are not impressive, either. &lt;em&gt;(Update: it’s quite likely that this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://epvantage.com/Universal/View.aspx?type=Story&amp;id=774872&amp;isEPVantage=yes&quot;&gt;even worse&lt;/a&gt; than it seems!)&lt;/em&gt; The stock market is not taking this well. ABBV is down $12 a share as I write, which takes out nearly $20 billion dollars of market cap from the stock. The fear is that if this is the DLL3-high group, which is supposed to be the best of the bunch, what are the full Phase 3 results going to look like? Forget about accelerated approval – AbbVie sure has to – what are the chances that this program works well enough to be approved at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also puts a bit of a hole in the cancer-stem-cell idea in general. It’s a complicated enough field that you’re not going to disprove it with a single agent or in a single type of cancer, but this does show that it’s not even as straightforward as it looks (and it didn’t look that straightforward!) As for this specific approach, and this specific deal, well. . .I suppose things could change eventually, but for now, it’s a disaster. We’ll see what AbbVie does after the full data come out. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2018/03/22/peter-thiel-backed-a-biotech-big-pharma-bought-it-it-blew-up/#4e92563d301f&quot;&gt;Matthew Herper’s take&lt;/a&gt; on this is well worth reading.

In a search for new potential multitarget anti-HIV compounds from natural products, we have identified in &lt;i&gt;Hypericum scruglii&lt;/i&gt;, an endemic and exclusive species of Sardinia (Italy), a potent plant lead. The phytochemical study of the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from its leaves led to the isolation of its most abundant secondary metabolites, belonging to different chemical classes. In particular, three phloroglucinols derivatives were identified, confirming their significance as chemotaxonomic markers of the &lt;i&gt;Hypericum&lt;/i&gt; genus. Among them, the 3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol was reported here for the first time. All six isolated compounds have been evaluated firstly for the inhibition of both Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-associated DNA Polymerase (RDDP) and Ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities, for the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in biochemical assays, and also for their effect on viral replication. Among the isolated metabolites, three phloroglucinol derivatives and quercitrin were effective on both RT-associated RDDP and RNase H activities in biochemical assays. The same active compounds affected also HIV-1 IN strand transfer function, suggesting the involvement of the RNase H active site.

In a search for new potential multitarget anti-HIV compounds from natural products, we have identified in &lt;i&gt;Hypericum scruglii&lt;/i&gt;, an endemic and exclusive species of Sardinia (Italy), a potent plant lead. The phytochemical study of the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from its leaves led to the isolation of its most abundant secondary metabolites, belonging to different chemical classes. In particular, three phloroglucinols derivatives were identified, confirming their significance as chemotaxonomic markers of the &lt;i&gt;Hypericum&lt;/i&gt; genus. Among them, the 3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol was reported here for the first time. All six isolated compounds have been evaluated firstly for the inhibition of both Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-associated DNA Polymerase (RDDP) and Ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities, for the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in biochemical assays, and also for their effect on viral replication. Among the isolated metabolites, three phloroglucinol derivatives and quercitrin were effective on both RT-associated RDDP and RNase H activities in biochemical assays. The same active compounds affected also HIV-1 IN strand transfer function, suggesting the involvement of the RNase H active site.

Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20–100%, 150 BAM files in total). To demonstrate feasibility beyond exome data, we introduced read alignments to a targeted 5-gene cell-free DNA sequencing library to simulate &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; amplifications at frequencies consistent with circulating tumor DNA (10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01%) while retaining the multimodal insert size distribution of the original data. We expect Bamgineer to be of use for development and systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms by users using locally-generated data for a variety of applications.

Background &lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease of unknown etiology in which genetic factors contribute to development of disease. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in multidrug resistance 1 (&lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt;) gene encoding transporter P-glycoprotein have been associated with IBD, but their role in disease susceptibility remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of three &lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms, C1236T (rs1128503), G2677T/A (rs2032582) and C3435T (rs1045642), with Serbian IBD patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 206 IBD patients, 107 Crohn&apos;s disease (CD) and 99 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 255 healthy controls were included in the study. All subjects were genotyped using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Comparisons between the groups were performed using the Pearson Chi-square test. False discovery rate according to Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Carriers of T allele of all three &lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt; SNPs were more common in UC patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting predisposing role of T allele of these SNPs in UC pathogenesis. Consistently, TT genotype of C1236T and TTT haplotype were also found more frequently in UC patients. On the other hand, C allele and CC genotype of C1236T and C3435T, as well as G allele and GG genotype of G2677T/A were more frequent in healthy subjects, implying protective role of these variants in UC. Likewise, CGC haplotype and CGC/CGC diplotype were more frequent in controls. Contrary to UC, no statistical difference was observed between CD patients and controls in any of the SNPs analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt; gene variants and haplotypes were associated with UC in Serbian IBD patients, further supporting their potential role in susceptibility to UC.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>378bd393</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dragana Mijac, Irena Vukovic-Petrovic, Vera Mijac, Vladimir Perovic, Natasa Milic, Srdjan Djuranovic, Daniela Bojic, Dragan Popovic, Djordje Culafic, Miodrag Krstic, Goran Jankovic, Vera Pravica, Milos Markovic&lt;/p&gt;

Random fluctuations in the amount of cellular components like mRNA and protein molecules are inevitable due to the stochastic and discrete nature of biochemical reactions. If large enough, this so-called “cellular noise” can lead to random transitions between the expression states of a multistable genetic circuit. That way, heterogeneity within isogenic populations is created. Our aim is to understand which dynamical features of a simple autoregulatory system determine its intrinsic noise level, and how they can be modified in order to regulate state-transitions. To that end, novel mathematical methods for the state-dependent characterization and prediction of noise in multistable systems are developed. First, we introduce the hybrid LNA, a modified version of the Linear Noise Approximation. It yields good predictions on variances of mRNA and protein fluctuations, even for reaction systems comprising low-copy-number components (e.g. mRNA) and highly nonlinear reaction rates. Furthermore, the temporal structure of fluctuations and the skewness of the protein distribution are characterized via state-dependent protein burst sizes and burst frequencies. Based on this mathematical framework, we develop graphical methods which support the intuitive design of regulatory circuits with a desired noise pattern. The methods are then used to predict how overall noise in the system can be adapted, and how state-specific noise modifications are possible that allow, e.g., the generation of unidirectional transitions. Our considerations are validated by stochastic simulations. This way, a design of genetic circuits is possible that takes population heterogeneity into account and is valuable in applications of synthetic biology and biotechnology. Moreover, natural phenomena like the bimodal development of genetic competence can be studied.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2ebafd65</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Katharina Hortsch, Andreas Kremling&lt;/p&gt;

Background &amp;amp; aims &lt;p&gt;To determine the prognostic potential of classic and novel serologic antibodies regarding unfavorable disease course in a prospective ulcerative colitis (UC) patient cohort, since few and conflicting data are available in the literature regarding this matter.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;187 consecutive patients were studied prospectively (median follow-up: 135 months) from a single referral IBD center in Hungary. Sera were tested for different IgA/IgG type autoantibodies (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic [ANCA], anti-DNA-bound-lactoferrin [anti-LFS], anti-goblet cell [anti-GAB] and anti-pancreatic [PAB: anti-CUZD1 and anti-GP2)]) by indirect immunofluorescence technique and for anti-microbial (anti-&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; [ASCA] IgG/IgA and anti-OMP Plus&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; IgA) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 73.6%, 62.4% and 11.2% of UC patients were positive for IgA/IgG type of atypical perinuclear-ANCA, anti-LFS and anti-GAB, respectively. Occurrences of PABs were 9.6%, while ASCA IgA/IgG and anti-OMP IgA were 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Antibody status was stable over time. IgA type PABs were more prevalent in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (37.5% vs. 4.7% for anti-CUZD1 and 12.5% vs. 0% for anti-GP2, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt; for both).

However, in multivariate Cox-regression analysis only ASCA IgA (HR: 2.74, 95%CI: 1.46–5.14, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;) remained independent predictor.

Performance-based financing (PBF) schemes have been expanding rapidly across low and middle income countries in the past decade, with considerable external financing from multilateral, bilateral and global health initiatives. Many of these countries have been fragile and conflict-affected (FCAS), but while the influence of context is acknowledged to be important to the operation of PBF, there has been little examination of how it affects adoption and implementation of PBF. This article lays out initial hypotheses about how FCAS contexts may influence the adoption, adaption, implementation and health system effects of PBF. These are then interrogated through a review of available grey and published literature (140 documents in total, covering 23 PBF schemes). We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>47fe2690</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Paola Bertone, Jean-Benoît Falisse, Giuliano Russo, Sophie Witter&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Detection and monitoring of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is rapidly becoming a diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tool in cancer patient care. A growing number of gene targets have been identified as diagnostic or actionable, requiring the development of reliable technology that provides analysis of multiple genes in parallel. We have developed the InVision™ liquid biopsy platform which utilizes enhanced TAm-Seq™ (eTAm-Seq™) technology, an amplicon-based next generation sequencing method for the identification of clinically-relevant somatic alterations at low frequency in ctDNA across a panel of 35 cancer-related genes.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We present analytical validation of the eTAm-Seq technology across two laboratories to determine the reproducibility of mutation identification.

Across two laboratories, analysis of samples with optimal amount of DNA detected 94% mutations at 0.25%-0.33% allele fraction (AF), with 90% of mutations detected for samples with lower amounts of input DNA.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These studies demonstrate that eTAm-Seq technology is a robust and reproducible technology for the identification and quantification of somatic mutations in circulating tumor DNA, and support its use in clinical applications for precision medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d1005238</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Davina Gale, Andrew R.

A dominant mechanism in the Judgment and Decision Making literature states that information is accumulated about each choice option until a decision threshold is met. Only after that threshold does a subject start to execute a motor response to indicate their choice. However, recent research has revealed spatial gradients in motor responses as a function of comparison difficulty as well as changes-of-mind in the middle of an action, both suggesting continued accumulation and processing of decision-related signals after the decision boundary. Here we present a formal model and supporting data from a number comparison task that a continuous motor planner, combined with a simple statistical inference scheme, can model detailed behavioral effects without assuming a threshold. This threshold-free model reproduces subjects’ sensitivity to numerical distance in reaching, accuracy, reaction time, and changes of mind. We argue that the motor system positions the effectors using an optimal biomechanical feedback controller, and continuous statistical inference on outputs from cognitive processes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5f69c1c2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Santiago Alonso-Diaz, Jessica F.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Heightened sexual risk in adolescence and young adulthood may be partially explained by deficits in executive functioning, the set of cognitive processes used to make reasoned decisions. However, the association between executive function and sexual risk is understudied among adolescent girls and young women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In a cohort of 853 young women age 18–25 in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa, we evaluated executive function with three non-verbal cognitive tests: I. a rule-finding test, II. a trail-making test, and III. a figure drawing test. Using log-binomial regression models, we estimated the association between lower executive function test scores and indicators of sexual risk (unprotected sex acts, concurrent partnerships, transactional sex, and recent HSV-2 infection).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In general, young women with lower executive function scores reported higher frequencies of sexual risk outcomes, though associations tended to be small with wide confidence intervals. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test I was associated with more unprotected sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.4 (1.0, 1.8)]. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test II was associated with more concurrent relationships and transactional sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.6 (1.1, 2.5) and 1.7 (1.3, 2.4), respectively], and testing in the lowest four quintiles of Test III was associated with more concurrent relationships [aPR (95% CI): 1.7 (1.0, 2.7)].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate an association between low executive function and sexual risk in South African young women.

Future work should seek to understand the nature of this association and whether there is promise in developing interventions to enhance executive function to reduce sexual risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Executive function associated with sexual risk in young South African women: Findings from the HPTN 068 cohort</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7692e:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195217</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195217</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522702800000</published><author><name>Molly Rosenberg</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522690928501</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471218300620</canonicalUrl><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218300620%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D9a6a27c5faf50f409478730ae673de20</originId><summary><content>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell Systems&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Ning Shen, Jingkang Zhao, Joshua L.

Anthocyanins are naturally active substances. In this study, anthocyanins from black rice were obtained by membrane filtration and column chromatography separation. Five anthocyanin monomers in black rice extract were identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and the major anthocyanin monomer (cyanidin-3-glucoside, C3G) was purified by preparative HPLC (Pre-HPLC). The proliferative effects of the anthocyanins on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were investigated by determining the media pH, bacterial populations and metabolic products. After anaerobic incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, not only the pH of the media containing C3G was lower than that of the extract of black rice anthocyanin (BRAE), but the numbers of both Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were also significantly increased. Furthermore, hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, and hydroxybenzoic acids and other metabolites were detected by GC-MS &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our results revealed that the anthocyanins and anthocyanin monomers from black rice had prebiotic activity and they were metabolized into several small molecules by Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7673a56e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yongsheng Zhu, Hanju Sun, Shudong He, Qiuyan Lou, Min Yu, Mingming Tang, Lijun Tu&lt;/p&gt;

Locomotion of machines and robots operating in rough terrain is strongly influenced by the mechanics of the ground-machine interactions. A rolling wheel in terrain with obstacles is subject to collisional energy losses, which is governed by mechanics comparable to hopping or walking locomotion. Here we investigate the energetic cost associated with overcoming an obstacle for rolling and hopping locomotion, using a simple mechanics model. The model considers collision-based interactions with the ground and the obstacle, without frictional losses, and we quantify, analyse, and compare the sources of energetic costs for three locomotion strategies. Our results show that the energetic advantages of the locomotion strategies are uniquely defined given the moment of inertia and the Froude number associated with the system. We find that hopping outperforms rolling at larger Froude numbers and vice versa. The analysis is further extended for a comparative study with animals. By applying size and inertial properties through an allometric scaling law of hopping and trotting animals to our models, we found that the conditions at which hopping becomes energetically advantageous to rolling roughly corresponds to animals’ preferred gait transition speeds. The energetic collision losses as predicted by the model are largely verified experimentally.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fa5f9151</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Giardina, Fumiya Iida&lt;/p&gt;

The use of antimicrobial monomers, linked to the polymer chain of resin composites, is an interesting approach to circumvent the effects of bacteria on the dental and material surfaces.

In this study, we compared E. faecium strain 17OM39 with a marketed probiotic, non-pathogenic non-probiotic (NPNP) and pathogenic strains. The core genome analysis revealed, 17OM39 was closely related with marketed probiotic strain T110. Strain 17OM39 was found to be devoid of known vancomycin, tetracycline resistance genes and functional virulence genes. Moreover, 17OM39 is &apos;less open&apos; due to absence of frequently found transposable elements. Genes imparting beneficial functional properties were observed to be present in marketed probiotic T110 and 17OM39 strains.

The study also provides insights into the acquired and intrinsic drug resistance genes, which will be helpful for better understanding of the physiology of antibiotic resistance in E. faecium strains. In addition, we could identify genes contributing to the intrinsic ability of 17OM39 E. faecium isolate to be a potential probiotic.

In addition, we could identify genes contributing to the intrinsic ability of 17OM39 E. faecium isolate to be a potential probiotic. The study has comprehensively characterized genome sequence of each strain to find the genetic variation and understand effects of these on functionality, phenotypic complexity. Further the evolutionary relationship of species along with adaptation strategies have been including in this study.</description><title>Comparative Genome Analysis Reveals Important Genetic Factors Associated with Probiotic Property in Enterococcus faecium strains [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162977b40a6:a5f161a:34f43e70</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295881v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295881v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><published>1522911600000</published><author><name>Ghattargi, V.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Instability after total knee arthroplasty is a critical problem. The purpose of this study was to clarify the stability of implanted knees during walking by comparing differences in dynamic instability during knee acceleration between individuals with or without previously experienced subjective instability, as measured by self-reported questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We examined 92 knees with medial pivot implants. Mean patient age and follow-up duration were 78.4 years and 32.8 months, respectively. An accelerometer was used to investigate the accelerations along three axes; that is, vertical (VT), mediolateral (ML), and anteroposterior (AP) directions in 3-dimensional (3D) space. The analysis in the stance phase and gait cycle was performed by: (1) root mean square (RMS) values of acceleration and (2) frequency domain analysis using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). A self-reported knee instability score was used for the subjective feeling of instability.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 76 knees did not feel unstable (group 0), but 16 knees felt unstable (group 1) in patients during activities of daily living. Regarding the RMS, there were no differences in each direction between the groups. For FFT, the cumulative amplitude in the frequency &amp;lt; 30 Hz also showed no significant differences in all directions between the groups during the stance phase (VT, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.335; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.219; AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.523) or gait cycle (VT, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.077; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.082; AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.499).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Gait analysis based on the acceleration data showed that there were no between-group differences in objective dynamic instability during acceleration of the knee, with or without reports of previously experienced subjective instability, as assessed by the self-reported questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>79d90dc6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Soeno, Tomoharu Mochizuki, Osamu Tanifuji, Hiroshi Koga, Takayuki Murayama, Hiroki Hijikata, Yuki Takahashi, Naoto Endo&lt;/p&gt;

Past and contemporary human actions are causing numerous changes in patterns and processes at various ecosystem scales and trophic levels, including unintended downstream changes, such as species interactions. In its native range &lt;i&gt;Acca sellowiana&lt;/i&gt; (Feijoa) combines some characteristics of human interactions: incipient domestication, restricted to subtropical Atlantic Forest highlands, associated with the threatened conifer &lt;i&gt;Araucaria angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Araucaria), within a domesticated landscape with anthropogenic forest patches, and provides fruit at a time of resource shortage (Araucaria seeds—&lt;i&gt;pinhão&lt;/i&gt;). We quantify the trophic relationships between Feijoa and vertebrates, and evaluate the influences on interactions caused by environmental variations, Feijoa domestication evidences, spatial distance and fruit availability. In four sites within protected areas, we selected 28 focal individuals of Feijoa (seven/site) and collected three temporal replicas between 2015 and 2016, when we measured productivity and frugivory via 45-second videos taken with camera traps. Using ecological network, rarefaction curves and variation partitioning analyses, we evaluate the frugivory network topology, the spatiotemporal structure of communities in relation to fruit availability and the influence of predictive variables on frugivory. We found a large spatiotemporal variation in productivity of Feijoa and that 20 species consumed Feijoa fruits, with a species degree of 2.8 (±5.7) and average Feijoa degree of 14.4 (±10.1), in a modular network with intermediary connectance. Rarefaction curves showed that richness and the independent records are congruent with the fruit amount. Variation partitioning showed that, for the focal individuals, canopy area, green coverage, patch size and distance to water influenced frugivory, and the Feijoa domestication influenced significantly the mammalian frugivory. Feijoa is an important resource that provides food during the time of year when &lt;i&gt;Pinhão&lt;/i&gt; is absent, and attracts frugivores, maintain the residual diversity of vertebrates contributing to the structure of communities in highlands. Our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of the interactions between vertebrates and an incipient domesticated tree, in a cultural landscape and highly threatened environment, under a basal foodweb approach with implications for bottom-up and top-down forces. The results contribute to understanding animal-plant relationships, including concepts that can be replicated for other sessile prey and mobile predators in any region or habitat under different gradients of management. Thus, this work shows how human actions can change not only patterns of distribution and abundance but also the diversity and direction of interspecific interactions among species.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>3e325446</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juliano André Bogoni, Maurício Eduardo Graipel, Nivaldo Peroni&lt;/p&gt;

Over expression of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induces apoptosis and reduces neointima formation occurring after saphenous vein interposition grafting or coronary stenting. In studies to address the mechanism of TIMP-3-driven apoptosis in human VSMCs we find that TIMP-3 increased activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis was inhibited by expression of Cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) and dominant negative FAS-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD). TIMP-3 induced apoptosis did not cause mitochondrial depolarisation, increase activation of caspase-9 and was not inhibited by over-expression of B-cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), indicating a mitochondrial independent/type-I death receptor pathway. TIMP-3 increased levels of the First Apoptosis Signal receptor (FAS) and depletion of FAS with shRNA showed TIMP-3-induced apoptosis was FAS dependent. TIMP-3 induced formation of the Death-Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC), as detected by immunoprecipitation and by immunofluorescence. Cellular-FADD-like IL-1 converting enzyme-Like Inhibitory Protein (c-FLIP) localised with FAS at the cell periphery in the absence of TIMP-3 and this localisation was lost on TIMP-3 expression with c-FLIP adopting a perinuclear localisation. Although TIMP-3 inhibited FAS shedding, this did not increase total surface levels of FAS but instead increased FAS levels within localised regions at the cell surface. A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is inhibited by TIMP-3 and depletion of ADAM17 with shRNA significantly decreased FAS shedding. However ADAM17 depletion did not induce apoptosis or replicate the effects of TIMP-3 by increasing localised clustering of cell surface FAS. ADAM17-depleted cells could activate caspase-3 when expressing levels of TIMP-3 that were otherwise sub-apoptotic, suggesting a partial role for ADAM17 mediated ectodomain shedding in TIMP-3 mediated apoptosis. We conclude that TIMP-3 induced apoptosis in VSMCs is highly dependent on FAS and is associated with changes in FAS and c-FLIP localisation, but is not solely dependent on shedding of the FAS ectodomain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7884ae8f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by William R.

Koshu is indigenous to Japan and considered the most important wine grape in Japan. Koshu grape berry possesses characteristics that make it unique from European &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vinifera&lt;/i&gt; as wine grape. However, the physiological characteristics of Koshu leaf and internode remain unknown. An understanding of those characteristics would contribute to improvements in Koshu cultivation, thereby enhancing grape berry and wine quality. To identify the genes responsible for the physiological characteristics of Koshu, we comprehensively analyzed leaf and internode differences at the transcriptome level between Koshu and Pinot Noir by RNA sequencing. A total of 248 and 131 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in leaves and internodes, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of these DEGs revealed that “flavonoid biosynthesis” and “glutathione metabolism” pathways were significantly enriched in Koshu leaves. On the other hand, when internodes were compared, “flavonoid”-related GO terms were specifically detected in Koshu. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the expression of such genes as &lt;i&gt;leucoanthocyanidin reductase&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;flavonol synthase&lt;/i&gt; in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was higher in Koshu than Pinot Noir. Measurement of the relative expression levels of these genes by RT-qPCR validated the results obtained by RNA sequencing. The characteristics of Koshu leaf and internode, which are expected to produce flavonoids with antibacterial activity and UV protection function, would suit Japanese climate as a survival strategy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>94c9372c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shinichi Enoki, Yu Hamaguchi, Shunji Suzuki, Hiroyuki Fujisawa, Tomoki Hattori, Kayo Arita, Chiho Yamaguchi, Masachika Mikami, Shu Nagasaka, Keisuke Tanaka&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding the control of epigenetic regulation is key to explain and modify the aging process. Because histone-modifying enzymes are sensitive to shifts in availability of cofactors (e.g. metabolites), cellular epigenetic states may be tied to changing conditions associated with cofactor variability. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationships between cofactor fluctuations, epigenetic landscapes, and cell state transitions. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we generate an ensemble of epigenetic regulation (ER) systems whose heterogeneity reflects variability in cofactor pools used by histone modifiers. The heterogeneity of epigenetic metabolites, which operates as regulator of the kinetic parameters promoting/preventing histone modifications, stochastically drives phenotypic variability. The ensemble of ER configurations reveals the occurrence of distinct epi-states within the ensemble. Whereas resilient states maintain large epigenetic barriers refractory to reprogramming cellular identity, plastic states lower these barriers, and increase the sensitivity to reprogramming. Moreover, fine-tuning of cofactor levels redirects plastic epigenetic states to re-enter epigenetic resilience, and vice versa. Our ensemble model agrees with a model of metabolism-responsive loss of epigenetic resilience as a cellular aging mechanism. Our findings support the notion that cellular aging, and its reversal, might result from stochastic translation of metabolic inputs into resilient/plastic cell states via ER systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O1S3sVW-8ko&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f2ca599a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Núria Folguera-Blasco, Elisabet Cuyàs, Javier A.

The bacterial phylum Verrucomicrobia was formally described two decades ago and originally believed to be a minor member of many ecosystems; however, it is now recognized as ubiquitous and abundant in both soil and aquatic systems. Nevertheless, knowledge of the drivers of its relative abundance and within-phylum habitat preferences remains sparse, especially in lake systems. Here, we documented the distribution of Verrucomicrobia in 12 inland lakes in Southeastern Michigan, a Laurentian Great Lake (Lake Michigan), and a freshwater estuary, which span a gradient in lake sizes, depths, residence times, and trophic states. A wide range of physical and geochemical parameters was covered by sampling seasonally from the surface and bottom of each lake, and by separating samples into particle-associated and free-living fractions. On average, Verrucomicrobia was the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most abundant phylum (range 1.7–41.7%). Fraction, season, station, and depth explained up to 70% of the variance in Verrucomicrobia community composition and preference for these habitats was phylogenetically conserved at the class-level. When relative abundance was linearly modeled against environmental data, Verrucomicrobia and non-Verrucomicrobia bacterial community composition correlated to similar quantitative environmental parameters, although there were lake system-dependent differences and &gt; 55% of the variance remained unexplained. A majority of the phylum exhibited preference for the particle-associated fraction and two classes (Opitutae and Verrucomicrobiae) were identified to be more abundant during the spring season. This study highlights the high relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia in north temperate lake systems and expands insights into drivers of within-phylum habitat preferences of the Verrucomicrobia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a8448726</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Edna Chiang, Marian L.

Taken together, our results indicate that expression of VEGF-C in bone is sufficient to induce the pathologic hallmarks of GSD in mice.</description><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34323</originId><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16295bee3cf:a178315:7d6c1c1c</id><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34323</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34323</href></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1522886400000</published><author><name>bronek.pytowski@gmail.com (Asitha Silva)</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>41</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagementRate>2.73</engagementRate><crawled>1522930738127</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/292037</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292037v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Transcriptome profiles of individual cells reflect true and often unexplored biological diversity, but are also affected by noise of biological and technical nature.

The e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) consist of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and chemical additives for flavoring. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, and while some have been tested for toxicity in the laboratory, most have not. Here, we developed a 3-phase, 384-well, plate-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to rapidly triage and validate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids. Our data demonstrated that the PG/VG vehicle adversely affected cell viability and that a large number of e-liquids were more toxic than PG/VG. We also performed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on all tested e-liquids. Subsequent nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that e-liquids are an extremely heterogeneous group. Furthermore, these data indicated that (i) the more chemicals contained in an e-liquid, the more toxic it was likely to be and (ii) the presence of vanillin was associated with higher toxicity values. Further analysis of common constituents by electron ionization revealed that the concentration of cinnamaldehyde and vanillin, but not triacetin, correlated with toxicity. We have also developed a publicly available searchable website (www.eliquidinfo.org). Given the large numbers of available e-liquids, this website will serve as a resource to facilitate dissemination of this information. Our data suggest that an HTS approach to evaluate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids is feasible. Such an approach may serve as a roadmap to enable bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to better regulate e-liquid composition.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Djo1Z76O3OU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9e299804</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by M.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple marker of inflammation, has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation. However, whether it can be used to predict HCC development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative NLR for the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy. A total of 230 HBV-associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2012 were included in this study. Detailed clinical data included patients’ general characteristics, laboratory tests and imaging studies, surgical procedures and complications. Information on patients’ follow-up data was also obtained. We found that 38 (16.52%) patients developed HCC after splenectomy during the follow-up period. An elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of developing HCC in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for HCC development was 2.27. In patients who developed HCC during the follow-up period, NLR scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy. However, NLR scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop HCC. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fd6c6806</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqing Du, Jian Dong, Jianbin Bi, Ruhai Bai, Jia Zhang, Zheng Wu, Yi Lv, Xufeng Zhang, Rongqian Wu&lt;/p&gt;

In the context of an ageing population, understanding the transmission of infectious diseases such as scabies through well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases. Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random models to real data on scabies in residential care homes.

In the context of an ageing population, understanding the transmission of infectious diseases such as scabies through well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases. Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random models to real data on scabies in residential care homes. In particular, we review and benchmark different numerical methods for the integration of the differential equation system, and then select the most appropriate of these methods to perform inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We test the goodness-of-fit of this model using posterior predictive intervals and propagate forward the resulting parameter uncertainty in a Bayesian framework to consider the economic cost of delayed interventions against scabies, quantifying the benefits of prompt action in the event of detection.

Our simulation analysis shows that non-parametric data mining approaches, such as MDR, may work best under one simulation criteria for the high effect size (penetrance) datasets, while non-parametric methods designed for feature selection, such as Ranger and Gradient boosting, work best under other simulation criteria. Thus, using a collective approach proves to be more beneficial for selecting variables with epistatic effects also in low effect size datasets and different genetic architectures. Following this, we applied our proposed collective feature selection approach to select the top 1% of variables to identify potential interacting variables associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in ~44,000 samples obtained from Geisinger&apos;s MyCode Community Health Initiative (on behalf of DiscovEHR collaboration). Conclusions: In this study, we were able to show that selecting variables using a collective feature selection approach could help in selecting true positive epistatic variables more frequently than applying any single method for feature selection via simulation studies.

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sk4-TYwKrLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>35ffcce0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Dotu, Scott I.

Nitric oxide (NO) regulates neuronal function and thus is critical for tuning neuronal communication. Mechanisms by which NO modulates protein function and interaction include posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as S-nitrosylation. Importantly, cross signaling between S-nitrosylation and prenylation can have major regulatory potential. However, the exact protein targets and resulting changes in function remain elusive. Here, we interrogated the role of NO-dependent PTMs and farnesylation in synaptic transmission. We found that NO compromises synaptic function at the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in a cGMP-independent manner. NO suppressed release and reduced the size of available vesicle pools, which was reversed by glutathione (GSH) and occluded by genetic up-regulation of GSH-generating and de-nitrosylating glutamate-cysteine-ligase and S-nitroso-glutathione reductase activities. Enhanced nitrergic activity led to S-nitrosylation of the fusion-clamp protein complexin (cpx) and altered its membrane association and interactions with active zone (AZ) and soluble &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive fusion protein Attachment Protein Receptor (SNARE) proteins. Furthermore, genetic and pharmacological suppression of farnesylation and a nitrosylation mimetic mutant of cpx induced identical physiological and localization phenotypes as caused by NO. Together, our data provide evidence for a novel physiological nitrergic molecular switch involving S-nitrosylation, which reversibly suppresses farnesylation and thereby enhances the net-clamping function of cpx. These data illustrate a new mechanistic signaling pathway by which regulation of farnesylation can fine-tune synaptic release.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6OU2NItN4wI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>807ba190</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susan W.

It seems that faba bean (FB) seeds could be a good protein-energy component in animal feed, but the presence of anti-nutritional substances limits their use as a substitute of soybean meal. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of different concentrations of raw, low-tannin, FB seeds on the gut-bone axis in Ross 308 broilers. One-day old chickens were randomly subjected to one of the 3 dietary treatments: the control group was fed standard diet based on soybean meal and without FB seeds, and two groups were fed 8%/15% and 16%/22% of raw low-tannin FB seeds in the starter and grower, respectively. On the 35&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, hematological and serum biochemical analyses as well histomorphometry of the small intestine and liver tissue and bone mechanical tests were performed. The diet type had no effect on the body weight gain and feed conversion ratio. However, the basal intestinal structures were significantly reduced in birds fed the lower concentration of FB. The enlargement of nerve plexuses was dependent on the concentration used in the diet and, additionally, on the kind of plexus and location in the intestinal tract. The liver was characterized by an increase in non-hepatocytes. There was no influence of the low-tannin FB seeds on most of the analyzed serum parameters in the 35-day-old broiler chickens, except the decreased concentration of total cholesterol and Ca in both experimental groups, triglycerides in group I, and P and uric acid in group II. Furthermore, the increasing concentration of the dietary low-tannin FB did not influence the activities of AspAT (except the group fed the higher amount of FB), ALAT, and LDH. The broiler chickens had no visible leg lesions and no problem in the locomotor function, but the tibiae were lighter mainly in birds fed the higher concentration of FB seeds. Geometric analysis revealed reduction of the cross section area and wall thickness, indicating a decline in the bone midshaft, which influenced the densitometric parameters and the results of mechanical tests. In conclusion, the dietary inclusion of raw low-tannin FB seeds had no negative effects on broiler growth, but disturbed the intestine structure and tibia characteristics. Therefore, all these negative effects necessitate additional examinations before inclusion of raw low-tannin FB seed into poultry diet.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>cb1db6ad</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ewa Tomaszewska, Piotr Dobrowolski, Renata Klebaniuk, Małgorzata Kwiecień, Agnieszka Tomczyk-Warunek, Sylwia Szymańczyk, Sylwester Kowalik, Anna Milczarek, Tomasz Blicharski, Siemowit Muszyński&lt;/p&gt;

Cortical oscillations are thought to be involved in many cognitive functions and processes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate oscillations. One prominent but understudied mechanism is gap junction coupling. Gap junctions are ubiquitous in cortex between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, recent experiments indicate their strength can be modified in an activity-dependent manner, similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that activity-dependent gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate oscillations in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction plasticity in a recurrent cortical network based on recent experimental findings. We showed that gap junction plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism for oscillations by maintaining a tight balance between two network states: asynchronous irregular activity and synchronized oscillations. This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust communication between neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms: transient oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct functional role for gap junction plasticity in information transmission in cortex.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fShLgpxE30I&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f0ddef30</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Pernelle, Wilten Nicola, Claudia Clopath&lt;/p&gt;

Two plasma devices at atmospheric pressure (air dielectric barrier discharge and helium plasma jet) have been used to study the early germination of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; seeds during the first days. Then, plasma activated waters are used during the later stage of plant development and growth until 42 days. The effects on both testa and endospserm ruptures during the germination stage are significant in the case of air plasma due to its higher energy and efficiency of producing reactive oxygen species than the case of helium plasma. The latter has shown distinct effects only for testa rupture. Analysis of germination stimulations are based on specific stainings for reactive oxygen species production, peroxidase activity and also membrane permeability tests. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown a smoother seed surface for air plasma treated seeds that can explain the plasma induced-germination. During the growth stage, plants were watered using 4 kinds of water (tap and deionized waters activated or not by the low temperature plasma jet). With regards to other water kinds, the characterization of the tap water has shown a larger conductivity, acidity and concentration of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Only the tap water activated by the plasma jet has shown a significant effect on the plant growth. This effect could be correlated to reactive nitrogen species such as nitrite/nitrate species present in plasma activated tap water.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fa5a3ed9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maxime Bafoil, Achraf Jemmat, Yves Martinez, Nofel Merbahi, Olivier Eichwald, Christophe Dunand, Mohammed Yousfi&lt;/p&gt;

The maternal mortality situation is analyzed in México as an indicator that reflects the social development level of the country and was one of the millennial development objectives. The effect of a maternal death in the related social group has multiplier effects, since it involves family dislocation, economic impact and disruption of the orphans&apos; normal social development. Two perspectives that causes of maternal mortality were analyzed, on one hand, their relationship with social determinants and on the other, factors directly related to the health system. Evidence shows that comparing populations based on group of selected variables according to social conditions and health care access, statistically significant differences prevail according to education and marginalization levels, and access to medical care. In addition, the Age-Period-Cohort model raised, shows significant progress in terms of a downward trend in maternal mortality in a generational level. Those women born before 1980 had a greater probability of maternal death in relation to recent generations, which is a reflection of the improvement in social determinants and in the Health System. The age effect shows a problem in maternal mortality in women under 15 years old, so teen pregnancy is a priority in health and must be addressed in short term. There is no clear evidence of a period effect.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>21c0458a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Román Rodríguez-Aguilar&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Qualitative studies indicated that cancer survivors may be worried about finding a partner in the future, but whether this concern is warranted is unknown. We examined single people´s interest in dating a cancer survivor, how they perceive survivors’ traits, and their preferences about the timing of disclosing a cancer history.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In three experimental vignette studies, dating website members (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 324) and college students (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 138 and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 131) were randomly assigned to a vignette of a person with or without a history of cancer (experiment 1 &amp;amp; 2), or a cancer survivor beyond or during active follow-up (experiment 3). Respondents rated their interest in dating this fictive person, this person’s traits, and indicated their preferences about the timing of disclosure. ANOVAs with main and interaction effects of condition, gender, and relationship history were conducted, partial eta squared and Cohen’s &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; were used to estimate the magnitude of effects. Correlations were used to investigate relationships between interest in a date and assessment of traits.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors’ traits were assessed more positively, but interest to date them did not differ from healthy vignettes for both men and women. However, widowed respondents were much less interested in a date with a cancer survivor, and women showed less interest in a cancer survivor during active follow-up relative to survivors beyond follow-up.

Background &lt;p&gt;To examine the accuracy of Rapid Diagnosis of &lt;i&gt;Talaromyces marneffei&lt;/i&gt; (RDTM) in order to improve diagnosis and treatment for clinical measures and reduce the mortality due to associated infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we screened PubMed, Ovid (Cochrane library) and Web of Science, Chinese database CNKI and Wanfang for articles published between 1956 and December, 2017. Data were taken from cross-sectional studies as well as from baseline measurements in longitudinal studies with clinical follow-up. Articles were excluded if they did not contain a cohort with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; and a control cohort or a cohort with standard fungus culture. Data were extracted by two authors and checked by three for accuracy. For quality assessment, modified QUADAS-2 criteria were used.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The 26 included diagnostic studies enrolled 5,594 objectives in 632 patients with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; infections and 2,612 negative controls between 1996 and 2017 in Thailand, Vietnam and China. The total combined sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnosis of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68–0.90) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98–1.00). According to the experimental method, the included studies can be divided into three subgroups, including PCR-based, ELISA-based and others. The results showed these three subgroups had a highly pooled specificity of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99–1.00), 0.99 (0.98–1.00) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.91–1.00), respectively, while combined sensitivity was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.37–0.98), 0.82 (95% CI: 0.64–0.92) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.54–0.91), respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although serological methods with a high specificity is essential for potential rapid diagnostic, false-negative results can be obtained in the serum samples, there is no suitable rapid serological test to refer to as is the case with TM infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d31ae638</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chuanyi Ning, Jingzhen Lai, Wudi Wei, Bo Zhou, Jiegang Huang, Junjun Jiang, Bingyu Liang, Yanyan Liao, Ning Zang, Cunwei Cao, Hui Chen, Li Ye, Hao Liang&lt;/p&gt;

For quality assessment, modified QUADAS-2 criteria were used.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The 26 included diagnostic studies enrolled 5,594 objectives in 632 patients with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; infections and 2,612 negative controls between 1996 and 2017 in Thailand, Vietnam and China. The total combined sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnosis of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68–0.90) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98–1.00). According to the experimental method, the included studies can be divided into three subgroups, including PCR-based, ELISA-based and others. The results showed these three subgroups had a highly pooled specificity of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99–1.00), 0.99 (0.98–1.00) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.91–1.00), respectively, while combined sensitivity was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.37–0.98), 0.82 (95% CI: 0.64–0.92) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.54–0.91), respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although serological methods with a high specificity is essential for potential rapid diagnostic, false-negative results can be obtained in the serum samples, there is no suitable rapid serological test to refer to as is the case with TM infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Accuracy of rapid diagnosis of &amp;lt;i&gt;Talaromyces marneffei&amp;lt;/i&gt;: A systematic review and meta-analysis</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d743:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195569</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195569</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522962000000</published><author><name>Chuanyi Ning</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522951206524</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/06/292789</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292789v2?rss=1</originId><content><content>Transplantable kidneys are in very limited supply.

This study provides direct genetic evidence demonstrating that p53 codon 72 SNP directly impacts aging and longevity, which supports a role of p53 in regulation of longevity.</description><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34701</originId><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16247d99ec4:34fe6a1:34f43e70</id><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34701</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34701</href></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1521504000000</published><author><name>wh221@cinj.rutgers.edu (Cen Zhang)</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521623867076</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3356</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3356.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Bacterial actins are an evolutionarily diverse family of ATP-dependent filaments built from protomers with a conserved structural fold.

Although anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is considered a successful procedure in restoring knee stability, few studies have addressed the issue of aerobic capacity after ACL surgery. Soccer players need technical, tactical and physical skills to succeed, such as good knee function and aerobic capacity. Our purpose is to evaluate aerobic fitness in ACL injured professional football players and six months after ACL reconstruction compared to a control group. Twenty athletes with ACL injury were evaluated and underwent ACL reconstruction with hamstrings autograft, and were compared to twenty healthy professional soccer players. The methods used to evaluate aerobic fitness were maximum oxygen uptake (VO&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt;) and ventilatory thresholds with a treadmill protocol, before and six months after surgery, compared to a control group. Knee function questionnaires, isokinetic strength testing and body composition evaluation were also performed. Results: Median ACL-injured patients age was 21 years old, and controls 20.5 years old. (n.s.). Preoperative VO&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt; in the ACL injured group was 45.2 ± 4.3 mL/kg/min, postoperative 48.9 ± 3.8 mL/kg/min and controls 56.9 ± 4.2 mL/kg/min. (p&amp;lt; .001 in all comparisons). Body composition evaluation was similar in all situations. Knee function questionnaires and quadriceps peak torque deficit improved after surgery but were significantly lower compared to controls. Conclusion: Aerobic fitness is significantly reduced in professional soccer players with ACL injury, and six months of rehabilitation was not enough to restore aerobic function after ACL reconstruction, compared to non-injured players of the same level.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>df2a2d4c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adriano Marques de Almeida, Paulo Roberto Santos Silva, André Pedrinelli, Arnaldo J.

Genomic prediction exploits single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome for predicting genetic merit of selection candidates. In most models for genomic prediction, e.g. BayesA, B, C, R and GBLUP, independence of SNP effects is assumed. However, SNP effects are expected to be locally dependent given the presence of a nearby QTL because SNPs surrounding the QTL do not segregate independently. A consequence of ignoring this dependence is that SNPs with small effects may be overly shrunk, e.g. effects from markers with high minor allele frequencies (MAF) that flank QTL with low MAF. A nested mixture model (BayesN) is developed to account for the dependence of effects of SNPs that are closely linked, where the effects of SNPs in every non-overlapping genomic window &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; follow a point mass at zero for all SNPs or a mixture of some SNPs with nonzero effects and others with zero effects. It can be regarded as a parsimonious alternative to the existing antedependence model, antiBayesB, which allow a nonstationary dependence of SNP effects. Illumina 777K BovineHD genotypes from 948 Angus cattle were used to simulate 5,000 offspring, with 4,000 used for training and 1,000 for validation. Scenarios with 300 common (MAF &gt; 0.05) or rare (MAF &amp;lt; 0.05) QTL randomly selected from segregating SNPs were replicated 8 times. SNPs corresponding to QTL were masked from a 600k panel comprising SNPs with MAF &gt; 0.05 or a 50k evenly spaced subset of these. Compared with BayesB and a modified antiBayesB, BayesN improved the accuracy of prediction up to 2.0% with 50k SNPs and up to 7.0% with 600k SNPs, most improvements occurring in the rare QTL scenario. Computing time was reduced up to 60% with 50k SNPs and up to 75% with 600k SNPs. BayesN is an accurate and computationally efficient method for genomic prediction with whole-genome SNPs, especially for traits with rare QTL.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2b0a2650</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Zeng, Dorian Garrick, Jack Dekkers, Rohan Fernando&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the retention and discontinuation reasons of seven biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in a real-world setting of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 1,037 treatment courses with bDMARDs from 2009 to 2016 [female, 81.8%; baseline age, 59.6 y; disease duration 7.8 y; rheumatoid factor positivity 81.5%; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), 4.4; concomitant prednisolone 43.5% and methotrexate 68.6%; Bio-naïve, 57.1%; abatacept (ABT), 21.3%; tocilizumab (TCZ), 20.7%; golimumab (GLM), 16.9%; etanercept (ETN), 13.6%; adalimumab (ADA), 11.1%; infliximab (IFX), 8.5%; certolizumab pegol (CZP), 7.9%] were included in this multi-center, retrospective study. Drug retention and discontinuation reasons at 36 months were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and adjusted by potent confounders using Cox proportional hazards modeling. As a result, 455 treatment courses (43.9%) were stopped, with 217 (20.9%) stopping due to inefficacy, 113 (10.9%) due to non-toxic reasons, 86 (8.3%) due to toxic adverse events, and 39 (3.8%) due to remission.

Based on extensive Langevin Dynamics simulations we investigate the structural properties of a two-dimensional ensemble of magnetic rods with a peapod-like morphology, i.e, rods consisting of aligned single dipolar beads. Self-assembled configurations are studied for different directions of the dipole with respect to the rod axis. We found that with increasing misalignment of the dipole from the rod axis, the smaller the packing fraction at which the percolation transition is found. For the same density, the system exhibits different aggregation states for different misalignment. We also study the stability of the percolated structures with respect to temperature, which is found to be affected by the microstructure of the assembly of rods.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>1b624c1d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jorge L.

Here we demonstrate the application of a method that could accelerate the development of novel therapies by allowing direct and repeatable visualization of cellular function in the living eye, to study loss of vision in animal models of retinal disease, as well as evaluate the time course of retinal function following therapeutic intervention. We use high-resolution adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy to image fluorescence from the calcium sensor GCaMP6s. In mice with photoreceptor degeneration (rd10), we measured restored visual responses in ganglion cell layer neurons expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin ChrimsonR over a six-week period following significant loss of visual responses. Combining a fluorescent calcium sensor, a channelrhodopsin, and adaptive optics enables all-optical stimulation and recording of retinal neurons in the living eye. Because the retina is an accessible portal to the central nervous system, our method also provides a novel non-invasive method of dissecting neuronal processing in the brain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8b125121</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Soon Keen Cheong, Jennifer M.

Side scan sonar in low-cost ‘fishfinder’ systems has become popular in aquatic ecology and sedimentology for imaging submerged riverbed sediment at coverages and resolutions sufficient to relate bed texture to grain-size. Traditional methods to map bed texture (i.e. physical samples) are relatively high-cost and low spatial coverage compared to sonar, which can continuously image several kilometers of channel in a few hours. Towards a goal of automating the classification of bed habitat features, we investigate relationships between substrates and statistical descriptors of bed textures in side scan sonar echograms of alluvial deposits. We develop a method for automated segmentation of bed textures into between two to five grain-size classes. Second-order texture statistics are used in conjunction with a Gaussian Mixture Model to classify the heterogeneous bed into small homogeneous patches of sand, gravel, and boulders with an average accuracy of 80%, 49%, and 61%, respectively. Reach-averaged proportions of these sediment types were within 3% compared to similar maps derived from multibeam sonar.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>93af166</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Hamill, Daniel Buscombe, Joseph M.

Background and objectives &lt;p&gt;Sick neonates in malaria endemic areas are frequently transfused with donor blood unscreened for malaria parasite. Consequently, they are at risk of transfusional malaria which can lead to increased neonatal mortality. The study aimed to determine the burden of transfusional malaria in neonates to help in policy formulation on prevention of transfusional malaria.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;One hundred and sixty four neonates admitted into the neonatal unit of a tertiary hospital over a 10 month period who were scheduled for blood transfusion were screened for malaria parasites pre-transfusion, at three and 14 days post transfusion using Giemsa stained thick and thin films. Donor blood was screened for malaria parasites at the point of transfusion. Neonates who developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion were followed up for signs of malaria.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All recruited neonates tested negative to malaria parasite pre- transfusion. One hundred and twenty (73.2%) were term neonates with 94(57.3%) aged 1-7days. Four (2.4%) neonates developed malaria parasitaemia three days post transfusion and all four developed fever that resolved on treatment for malaria. Three (1.8%) of 164 donor blood samples had malaria parasitaemia and all three (100%) neonates who were transfused with the infected donor blood developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion. However, one neonate who developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion was transfused with non-infected donor blood.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of transfusional malaria in this study is low (2.4%). However, 100% of neonates who received malaria infected donor blood developed transfusional malaria.

There is still no consensus on the true origin of fatal yellowing, one of the most important diseases affecting oil palm (&lt;i&gt;Elaeis guineensis&lt;/i&gt; Jacq.) plantations. This study involved two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (2D-UPLC-MS&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;) analyses to identify changes in protein profiles of oil palms affected by FY disease. Oil palm roots were sampled from two growing areas. Differential accumulation of proteins was assessed by comparing plants with and without symptoms and between plants at different stages of FY development. Most of the proteins identified with differential accumulation were those related to stress response and energy metabolism. The latter proteins include the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, related to alcohol fermentation, which were identified in plants with and without symptoms. The presence of these enzymes suggests an anaerobic condition before or during FY. Transketolase, isoflavone reductase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and ferritin, among others, were identified as potential marker proteins and could be used to guide selection of FY-tolerant oil palm genotypes or to understand the source of this anomaly. When comparing different stages of FY, we observed high accumulation of alcohol dehydrogenase and other abiotic stress related-proteins at all disease stages. On the other hand, biological stress-related proteins were more accumulated at later stages of the disease. These results suggest that changes in abiotic factors can trigger FY development, creating conditions for the establishment of opportunistic pathogens.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>71aec6f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sidney Vasconcelos do Nascimento, Marcelo Murad Magalhães, Roberto Lisboa Cunha, Paulo Henrique de Oliveira Costa, Ronnie Cley de Oliveira Alves, Guilherme Corrêa de Oliveira, Rafael Borges da Silva Valadares&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The HIV care cascade has improved in Latin America over the last decade. However, the influence of alcohol and noninjected drug use (NIDU) on cascade outcomes is mostly unknown. This study estimated the association of alcohol and NIDU with retention in care, loss to follow up (LTFU), and virologic failure (VF).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Individuals ≥18 years attending routine HIV clinic visits and completing the Rapid Screening Tool (RST; evaluating NIDU and ART adherence in 7-day recall period) during 2012–13 were followed up to 2015 in the Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated for the association of alcohol consumption and NIDU with retention in care by logistic regression; adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated for the associations with LTFU and VF by Cox regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 3604 individuals, the proportions retained in care for one year were 84%, 79%, 72%, and 69% for patients reporting non-use, alcohol use, NIDU, and both alcohol and NIDU, respectively. For the same patient groups, the proportions LTFU over 18 months were 6%, 8%, 12%, and 13%, respectively. There were 1901 patients (53%) with HIV RNA results; VF proportions were similar between users and nonusers (ranging from 14–16%). After controlling for age, sex, study site, HIV transmission mode, time on ART, AIDS status, and CD4 count, neither alcohol use (aOR = 1.1, CI = 0.9–1.4; aHR = 1.0, CI = 0.8–1.3) nor NIDU (aOR = 1.3, CI = 0.9–1.8; aHR = 1.4, CI = 0.9–2.1) were significantly associated with retention or VF, respectively. However, both alcohol use (aHR = 1.2, CI = 1.02–1.4) and NIDU (aHR = 1.3, CI = 1.00–1.8) were associated with increased LTFU.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Alcohol use and NIDU in a 7-day recall period increased the risk of being LTFU during the next 18 months, highlighting the need for routine screening and targeted interventions to keep these individuals in care and on ART.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>db14b543</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Raquel B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Data are lacking on the risk and impact of a serious hemorrhage on the prognosis after ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). We aimed to estimate the incidence of serious hemorrhage, analyze the impact on mortality, and identify predictors of hemorrhage after discharge from IS or TIA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;All patients admitted to Östersund Hospital for an IS or TIA in 2010–2013 were included (n = 1528, mean age: 75.1 years). Serious hemorrhages were identified until 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; December 2015. Incidence rates were calculated. The impact on mortality (stratified by functional level) was determined with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Non-parametric estimation under the assumption of competing risk was performed to assess the cumulative incidence and predictors of serious hemorrhages.The incidence rates of serious (n = 113) and intracranial hemorrhages (n = 45) after discharge from IS and TIA were 2.48% and 0.96% per year at risk, respectively. Patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 3–5 exhibited 58.9% mortality during follow-up and those with mRS scores of 0–2 exhibited 18.4% mortality. A serious hemorrhage did not affect mortality in patients with impaired functional status, but it increased the risk of death in patients with mRS scores of 0–2. Hypertension was associated with increased risk of serious hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found that, after discharge from an IS or TIA, serious hemorrhages were fairly common. Impairments in function were associated with high mortality, but serious hemorrhages only increased the risk of mortality in patients with no or slight disability. Improved hypertension treatment may decrease the risk of serious hemorrhage, but in patients with low functional status, poor survival makes secondary prevention challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fc4e7cf8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joachim Ögren, Anna-Lotta Irewall, Lars Söderström, Thomas Mooe&lt;/p&gt;

Antimicrobial peptides represent an alternative to traditional antibiotics that may be less susceptible to bacterial resistance mechanisms by directly attacking the bacterial cell membrane. However, bacteria have a variety of defense mechanisms that can prevent cationic antimicrobial peptides from reaching the cell membrane. The L- and D-enantiomers of the antimicrobial peptide GL13K were tested against the Gram-positive bacteria &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus gordonii&lt;/i&gt; to understand the role of bacterial proteases and cell wall modifications in bacterial resistance. GL13K was derived from the human salivary protein BPIFA2. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by broth dilution and a serial assay used to determine bacterial resistance. Peptide degradation was determined in a bioassay utilizing a luminescent strain of &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; to detect peptide activity. Autolysis and D-alanylation-deficient strains of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gordonii&lt;/i&gt; were tested in autolysis assays and peptide activity assays. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; protease inactivated L-GL13K but not D-GL13K, whereas autolysis did not affect peptide activity. Indeed, the D-enantiomer appeared to kill the bacteria prior to initiation of autolysis. D-alanylation mutants were killed by L-GL13K whereas this modification did not affect killing by D-GL13K. The mutants regained resistance to L-GL13K whereas bacteria did not gain resistance to D-GL13K after repeated treatment with the peptides. D-alanylation affected the hydrophobicity of bacterial cells but hydrophobicity alone did not affect GL13K activity.

Chronic stress is an important factor influencing people’s health. It usually causes endocrinal disorders and a decline in reproduction in females. Although studies of both human and animals suggest a detrimental effect of stress on reproduction, the influence of chronic stress on the ovarian reservation and follicular development is still not clear. In this study, a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model was used to investigate the effect of stress on ovarian reservation and follicular development and explore the underlying mechanism. In this study, after 8 weeks of CRS, primordial follicles were excessively activated in the ovaries of the CRS group compared with the control group. Further results showed that the activation of primordial follicles induced by CRS was involved in the increasing expression level of Kit ligand and its receptor Kit and the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway.

Chronic stress is an important factor influencing people’s health. It usually causes endocrinal disorders and a decline in reproduction in females. Although studies of both human and animals suggest a detrimental effect of stress on reproduction, the influence of chronic stress on the ovarian reservation and follicular development is still not clear. In this study, a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model was used to investigate the effect of stress on ovarian reservation and follicular development and explore the underlying mechanism. In this study, after 8 weeks of CRS, primordial follicles were excessively activated in the ovaries of the CRS group compared with the control group. Further results showed that the activation of primordial follicles induced by CRS was involved in the increasing expression level of Kit ligand and its receptor Kit and the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. The corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide released due to stress, which plays an important role in regulating follicle development. A high level of serum CRH was detected in the CRS mouse model, and the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay showed that the mRNA level of its main receptor CRHR1increased in the ovaries of the CRS mouse group. Moreover, 100nM CRH significantly improved the activation of primordial follicles in newborn mouse ovaries &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. These results demonstrated that CRS could induce immoderate activation of primordial follicles accompanied by the activation of Kit-PI3K signaling, in which CRH might be an important endocrine factor.</description><title>Chronic restraint stress induces excessive activation of primordial follicles in mice ovaries</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c4c:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194894</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194894</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522443600000</published><author><name>Minhua Xu</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522431541169</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00204</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00204/20180328/images/medium/bi-2018-00204r_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00204&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Whether metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals are at increased risk of ischemic stroke is not well known. We investigated the association of the MHO phenotype with ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 354,083 adults (age 45.8 ± 14.2 years) from the Korean National Health Insurance Service–National Sample Cohort enrolled in 2004–2008 were followed-up for incident ischemic stroke until 2013. Subjects meeting none of the metabolic syndrome criteria were classified as ‘metabolically healthy’. The cohort was categorized into four groups according to obesity and metabolic status: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), MHO, and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke was newly diagnosed in 4,884 (1.4%) individuals during a mean follow-up of 7.4 ± 1.5 years. Stroke incidence rates for the MHNW, MUNW, MHO, and MUO groups were 0.56, 2.61, 0.61, and 2.76 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. While risk for stroke increased significantly in metabolically unhealthy groups, it was not increased in MHO compared to the MHNW group on multivariate analysis. In metabolically healthy individuals, obesity did not increase the risk for ischemic stroke, regardless of the severity of obesity. Meanwhile, in metabolically unhealthy individuals, being obese was significantly associated with increased risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MHO individuals were not at increased risk for ischemic stroke. However, obesity increased risk for ischemic stroke in persons with metabolic risk factors; therefore, maintaining normal weight may be more important for this population.

Anti-predator signaling is highly variable with numerous examples of species employing cryptic coloration to avoid detection or conspicuous coloration (often coupled with a secondary defense) to ensure detection and recollection. While the ends of this spectrum are clear in their function, how species use intermediate signals is less clear. Australian Brood Frogs (&lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt;) display conspicuous coloration on both their dorsum and venter. Coupled with the alkaloid toxins these frogs possess, this coloration may be aposematic, providing a protective warning signal to predators. We assessed predation rates of known and novel color patterns and found no difference for avian or mammalian predators. However, when &lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt; dorsal phenotypes were collectively compared to the high-contrast ventral phenotype of this genus, we found birds, but not mammals, attacked dorsal phenotypes significantly less frequently than the ventral phenotype. This study, importantly, shows a differential predator response to ventral coloration in this genus which has implications for the evolution of conspicuous signaling in &lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>12f1d344</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by J.

We assessed predation rates of known and novel color patterns and found no difference for avian or mammalian predators. However, when &lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt; dorsal phenotypes were collectively compared to the high-contrast ventral phenotype of this genus, we found birds, but not mammals, attacked dorsal phenotypes significantly less frequently than the ventral phenotype. This study, importantly, shows a differential predator response to ventral coloration in this genus which has implications for the evolution of conspicuous signaling in &lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt;.</description><title>Differential responses of avian and mammalian predators to phenotypic variation in Australian Brood Frogs</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d730:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195446</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195446</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522962000000</published><author><name>J.

Cardiac 4D flow MRI was performed in healthy volunteers at 1.5T (n = 23). Reproducibility was investigated using MR scanners from two different vendors on the same day (n = 8). Subsets of volunteers were also imaged without respiratory gating (n = 17), at 3T on the same day (n = 6), and 1–12 days later on the same scanner (n = 9, median 6 days).

The PgdS enzyme is a poly-γ-glutamic (γ-PGA) hydrolase, which has potential application for a controllable degradation of γ-PGA by enzymatic depolymerization; however, the structure of PgdS is still unknown. Here, to study in detail the full-length PgdS structure, we analyze the low-resolution architecture of PgdS hydrolase from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; in solution using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) method. Combining with other methods, like dynamic light scattering and mutagenesis analyses, a model for the full length structure and the possible substrate delivery route of PgdS are proposed. The results will provide useful hints for future investigations into the mechanisms of γ-PGA degradation by the PgdS hydrolase and may provide valuable practical information.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>232224db</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jumei Zeng, Yun Jin, Zhongchuan Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, fatal manifestation of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS). Some patients with advanced HPS pulmonary fibrosis undergo lung transplantation despite their disease-associated bleeding tendency; others die while awaiting donor organs. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical management and outcomes of a cohort with advanced HPS pulmonary fibrosis who were evaluated for lung transplantation. Six patients with HPS-1 pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center and one of two regional lung transplant centers. Their median age was 41.5 years pre-transplant. Three of six patients died without receiving a lung transplant. One of these was referred with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis and died before a donor organ became available, and donor organs were not identified for two other patients sensitized from prior blood product transfusions. Three of six patients received bilateral lung transplants; they did not have a history of excessive bleeding. One patient received peri-operative desmopressin, one was transfused with intra-operative platelets, and one received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and intra-operative prothrombin complex concentrate, platelet transfusion, and desmopressin. One transplant recipient experienced acute rejection that responded to pulsed steroids. No evidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction or recurrence of HPS pulmonary fibrosis was detected up to 6 years post-transplant in these three lung transplant recipients. In conclusion, lung transplantation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are viable options for patients with HPS pulmonary fibrosis. Alloimmunization in HPS patients is an important and potentially preventable barrier to lung transplantation; interventions to limit alloimmunization should be implemented in HPS patients at risk of pulmonary fibrosis to optimize their candidacy for future lung transplants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d4eb2434</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Souheil El-Chemaly, Kevin J.

Metabolic engineering focuses on rewriting the metabolism of cells to enhance native products or endow cells with the ability to produce new products. This engineering has the potential for wide-range application, including the production of fuels, chemicals, foods and pharmaceuticals. Glycolysis manages the levels of various secondary metabolites by controlling the supply of glycolytic metabolites. Metabolic reprogramming of glycolysis is expected to cause an increase in the secondary metabolites of interest. In this study, we constructed a budding yeast strain harboring the combination of triple sirtuin gene deletion (&lt;i&gt;hst3&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;hst4&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;sir2&lt;/i&gt;∆) and interruption of gluconeogenesis by the deletion of the &lt;i&gt;FBP1&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (&lt;i&gt;fbp1&lt;/i&gt;∆). &lt;i&gt;hst3&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;hst4&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;sir2&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;fbp1&lt;/i&gt;∆ cells harbored active glycolysis with high glucose consumption and active ethanol productivity. Using capillary electrophoresis–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE–TOF/MS) analysis, &lt;i&gt;hst3&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;hst4&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;sir2&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;fbp1&lt;/i&gt;∆ cells accumulated not only glycolytic metabolites but also secondary metabolites, including nucleotides that were synthesized throughout the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, although various amino acids remained at low levels.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the number of studies that have tried to demonstrate that there is an association between previous falls and the fear of falling, the relationship between these two variables remains a matter of controversy.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our objective was to investigate whether the fear of falling is a cause of falls, a consequence, or both in community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 75 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A descriptive, longitudinal, prospective study was performed. A total of 640 individuals were interviewed between 2009 and 2011. Sociodemographic data, health status, history of falls and fear of falling were assessed at baseline and at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of falls at baseline was 25% as opposed to 35.2% at 24 months. The prevalence of the fear of falling was 41.5% at baseline. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between a history of falls and the fear of falling. Other factors associated with the fear of falling were female gender, comorbidity, depressive symptoms, and disability. In total, 41.7% of the subjects who had reported a fear of falling at baseline had suffered at least one fall 24 months later. Unadjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that the fear of falling was a risk factor for falls. According to the final model adjusted for other covariates, the only reliable predictor was female gender. The Cox model stratified by gender failed to show a crude association between fear of falling and falls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A previous history of falls in the previous year was a good predictor of the fear of falling; but the fear of falling was a predictor of falls during follow-up only in the unadjusted model, pointing to strong gender turns out as an effect modifier of the association of FOF and subsequent falls.

The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC provides an efficient platform for profiling DNA methylation in humans at over 850,000 CpGs. Model organisms such as mice do not currently benefit from an equivalent array. Here we used this array to measure DNA methylation in mice. We defined probes targeting conserved regions and performed differential methylation analysis and compared between the array-based assay and affinity-based DNA sequencing of methyl-CpGs (MBD-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Mouse samples consisted of 11 liver DNA from two strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), that varied widely in age. Linear regression was applied to detect differential methylation. In total, 13,665 probes (1.6% of total probes) aligned to conserved CpGs. Beta-values (β-value) for these probes showed a distribution similar to that in humans. Overall, there was high concordance in methylation signal between the EPIC array and MBD-seq (Pearson correlation r = 0.70, p-value &amp;lt; 0.0001). However, the EPIC probes had higher quantitative sensitivity at CpGs that are hypo- (β-value &amp;lt; 0.3) or hypermethylated (β-value &gt; 0.7). In terms of differential methylation, no EPIC probe detected a significant difference between age groups at a Benjamini-Hochberg threshold of 10%, and the MBD-seq performed better at detecting age-dependent change in methylation. However, the top most significant probe for age (cg13269407; uncorrected p-value = 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;) is part of the clock CpGs used to estimate the human epigenetic age. For strain, 219 EPIC probes detected significant differential methylation (FDR cutoff 10%) with ~80% CpGs associated with higher methylation in D2. This higher methylation profile in D2 compared to B6 was also replicated by the MBD-seq data. To summarize, we found only a small subset of EPIC probes that target conserved sites. However, for this small subset the array provides a reliable assay of DNA methylation and can be effectively used to measure differential methylation in mice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4bd5067b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hemant Gujar, Jane W.

Background &lt;p&gt;We have reported that WNT10A plays a critical role in the growth of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and microvascular endothelial cells, i.e.; wound healing/scarring. To ascertain the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; regulatory, central functions of WNT10A, we examined the net effects of WNT10A depletion using &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice (&lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We generated &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;mice, displaying a range of unique phenotypes of morpho/organogenetic failure, such as growth retardation, alopecia, kyphosis and infertility, and then focused on the functions of WNT10A in wound healing. We subjected C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) or &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;mice to skin ulcer formation. The &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;mice had significantly larger injured areas and delayed wound healing, which were associated with (a) a smaller number of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and microvessels; and (b) more reduced expression and synthesis of collagen, compared with WT mice with intact WNT10A expression, especially in those with activated myofibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These observations indicate that WNT10A signaling can play a pivotal in vivo role in wound healing by regulating the expression and synthesis of collagen, as one of fibrogenic factors, at least in part, and critical &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; roles of WNT10A-mediated effective wound healing are extremely closely associated with collagen expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>66079f8e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ke-Yong Wang, Sohsuke Yamada, Hiroto Izumi, Manabu Tsukamoto, Tamiji Nakashima, Takashi Tasaki, Xin Guo, Hidetaka Uramoto, Yasuyuki Sasaguri, Kimitoshi Kohno&lt;/p&gt;

Our approach, broadly applicable to any microbial or other ecological network, can drive the discovery of new interactions and new molecular mechanisms, both for therapeutic interventions involving natural communities and for the rational design of synthetic consortia.</description><title>Machine learning reveals missing edges and putative interaction mechanisms in microbial ecosystem networks [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1624ac0c072:39d03cc:7d6c1c1c</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286641v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286641v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><published>1521615600000</published><author><name>DiMucci, D.</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521672568946</crawled></item><item><engagement>141</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03991-y</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beguiling dark-matter signal persists 20 years on&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beguiling dark-matter signal persists 20 years on, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03991-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03991-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Physicists at experiment in Italy continue to see a data fluctuation that they say represents dark matter — but the mystery deepens.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>cc0a2f8b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beguiling dark-matter signal persists 20 years on&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beguiling dark-matter signal persists 20 years on, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03991-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03991-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Physicists at experiment in Italy continue to see a data fluctuation that they say represents dark matter — but the mystery deepens.</description><title>Beguiling dark-matter signal persists 20 years on</title><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1626e1d0f0d:6b7c0bb:7d6c1c1c</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03991-y</link><published>1522220400000</published><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03991-y</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Davide Castelvecchi</name></author><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522265820941</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/179028</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/179028v2?rss=1</originId><content><content>The high-throughput capacities of the Illumina sequencing platforms and possibility to label samples individually have encouraged a wide use of sample multiplexing.

Vibrations are important cues for tactile perception across species. Whisker-based sensation in mice is a powerful model system for investigating mechanisms of tactile perception. However, the role vibration plays in whisker-based sensation remains unsettled, in part due to difficulties in modeling the vibration of whiskers. Here, we develop an analytical approach to calculate the vibrations of whiskers striking objects. We use this approach to quantify vibration forces during active whisker touch at a range of locations along the whisker. The frequency and amplitude of vibrations evoked by contact are strongly dependent on the position of contact along the whisker. The magnitude of vibrational shear force and bending moment is comparable to quasi-static forces. The fundamental vibration frequencies are in a detectable range for mechanoreceptor properties and below the maximum spike rates of primary sensory afferents. These results suggest two dynamic cues exist that rodents can use for object localization: vibration frequency and comparison of vibrational to quasi-static force magnitude. These complement the use of quasi-static force angle as a distance cue, particularly for touches close to the follicle, where whiskers are stiff and force angles hardly change during touch. Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oRjfKRlw_io&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c4a8f063</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Vaxenburg, Isis Wyche, Karel Svoboda, Alexander L.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to describe the clinical significance of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium simiae&lt;/i&gt; at a major tertiary care center in Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective study of patients with positive cultures for &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;simiae&lt;/i&gt; isolated between 2004 and 2016 at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;This study included 103 &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;simiae&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from 51 patients. Their mean age was 62.7 years. The majority were males and smokers. Specimens were mostly from respiratory sources (97%). Common comorbidities included chronic lung disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), solid tumor, systemic disease, and diabetes mellitus. Productive cough and dyspnea were the most common symptoms. Frequent radiographic findings were infiltrates and nodules on chest X-ray and nodules, infiltrates, and bronchiectasis on chest computed tomography scan. Among 18 tested isolates, 5.8% were resistant to clarithromycin, 11.7% to amikacin, and 70–100% to other antimicrobials. Out of 13 patients receiving early treatment, 5 noted improvement, one had recurrence of symptoms, two received alternative diagnosis, and five died. Two of those deaths were related to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;simiae&lt;/i&gt;. Common treatment regimens included clarithromycin in different combinations with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, moxifloxacin, and amikacin. Moreover, clofazimine was used in only two patients whose isolates were resistant to all but one agent. Duration of treatment ranged from 6–24 months.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In Lebanon, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;simiae&lt;/i&gt; is increasingly encountered with true infection rates of at least 47%. Furthermore, the prevalence of multidrug resistance among the Lebanese &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;simiae&lt;/i&gt; isolates is very high limiting the treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fcd2e31a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amal Hamieh, Ralph Tayyar, Houssam Tabaja, Saeed E.

Duration of treatment ranged from 6–24 months.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In Lebanon, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;simiae&lt;/i&gt; is increasingly encountered with true infection rates of at least 47%. Furthermore, the prevalence of multidrug resistance among the Lebanese &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;simiae&lt;/i&gt; isolates is very high limiting the treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Emergence of &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium simiae&amp;lt;/i&gt;: A retrospective study from a tertiary care center in Lebanon</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57600:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195390</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195390</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522875600000</published><author><name>Amal Hamieh</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522863723954</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017682?af=R</originId><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><fingerprint>4748de72</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><title>The electrothermal conductance and heat capacity of black phosphorus</title><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1622364c343:d035b:34f43e70</id><unread>False</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017682?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017682?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><published>1520487525000</published><author><name>Parijat Sengupta</name></author><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/10&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 10&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521012228931</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00072</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.7b00072/20180409/images/medium/bi-2017-00072x_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00072&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Phylogenetic relationships of clinid ceratomyxids based on the SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA and ITS regions were assessed additionally to the investigation of population genetic structure of &lt;i&gt;Ceratomyxa cottoidii&lt;/i&gt; and subsequent comparison with the data known from type fish host &lt;i&gt;Clinus cottoides&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Results and discussion &lt;p&gt;Seven &lt;i&gt;Ceratomyxa&lt;/i&gt; species including previously described &lt;i&gt;Ceratomyxa dehoopi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cottoidii&lt;/i&gt; were recognized in clinids.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence rate and associated factors of co-morbid mental disability among the elderly with motor disability. Data was obtained from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability (CNSSD). 250,752 older adults aged 65 years and above were sampled from 5964 sites, 2980 towns, 734 counties in 31 provinces in China. Descriptive statistics were used for population-weighted numbers and prevalence of co-morbid mental disability by different characteristics. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the association between mental disability, and the factors of co-morbid mental disability among physical disability. Among the elderly with motor disability, 275,607 persons (2.28%, 99% CI: 1.97–2.59) had co-morbid mental disability at the survey time, which was significantly higher than those without motor disability (OR: 2.11, 99% CI: 1.83–2.43). The factors associated with a higher risk of co-morbid mental disability included urban areas (OR: 1.38; 99% CI: 1.04–1.84), east (2.60, 1.76–3.83) or west (1.65, 1.06–2.55) regions, having other co-morbid disabilities (5.93, 4.48–7.85), and having more severe motor disability (Moderate: 1.81, 1.28–2.57; Severe: 2.90, 2.08–4.04; Extremely severe: 4.22, 2.96–6.01). The elderly with motor disability have a high risk of co-morbid mental disability, especially for higher socioeconomic groups. These findings highlight the need of and will be beneficial for implementing more comprehensive prevention and rehabilitation strategies, to prevent and control the emergence and development of multiple disabilities and promote the physical and mental health of the elderly.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4c1b2e96</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guo, Ping He, Xinming Song, Gong Chen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Aranbaltza is an archaeological complex formed by at least three open-air sites. Between 2014 and 2015 a test excavation carried out in Aranbaltza III revealed the presence of a sand and clay sedimentary sequence formed in floodplain environments, within which six sedimentary units have been identified. This sequence was formed between 137–50 ka, and includes several archaeological horizons, attesting to the long-term presence of Neanderthal communities in this area. One of these horizons, corresponding with Unit 4, yielded two wooden tools. One of these tools is a beveled pointed tool that was shaped through a complex operational sequence involving branch shaping, bark peeling, twig removal, shaping, polishing, thermal exposition and chopping. A use-wear analysis of the tool shows it to have traces related with digging soil so it has been interpreted as representing a digging stick. This is the first time such a tool has been identified in a European Late Middle Palaeolithic context; it also represents one of the first well-preserved Middle Palaeolithic wooden tool found in southern Europe. This artefact represents one of the few examples available of wooden tool preservation for the European Palaeolithic, allowing us to further explore the role wooden technologies played in Neanderthal communities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>3d1a2f4e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joseba Rios-Garaizar, Oriol López-Bultó, Eneko Iriarte, Carlos Pérez-Garrido, Raquel Piqué, Arantza Aranburu, María José Iriarte-Chiapusso, Illuminada Ortega-Cordellat, Laurence Bourguignon, Diego Garate, Iñaki Libano&lt;/p&gt;

Striatal CINs exhibit tonic firing punctuated by distinct pauses. Pauses occur in response to motivationally significant events, but their function is unknown. Here we investigated the effects of pauses in CIN firing on spiny projection neurons (SPNs) – the output neurons of the striatum – using in vivo whole cell and juxtacellular recordings in mice. We found that optogenetically-induced pauses in CIN firing inhibited subthreshold membrane potential activity and decreased firing of SPNs. During pauses, SPN membrane potential fluctuations became more hyperpolarized and UP state durations became shorter. In addition, short-term plasticity of corticostriatal inputs was decreased during pauses.

Acute stress responsiveness is a quantitative trait that varies in severity from one individual to another; however, the genetic component underlying the individual variation is largely unknown. Fischer 344 (F344) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat strains show large differences in behavioral responsiveness to acute stress, such as freezing behavior in response to footshock during the conditioning phase of contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for behavioral responsiveness to acute stress in the defensive burying (DB) and open field test (OFT) from a reciprocal F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cross of F344 and WKY rat strains. These included a significant QTL on chromosome 6 (&lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt;). Here, we hypothesized that the &lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt; region harbors genes with sequence variation(s) that contribute to differences in multiple behavioral response phenotypes between the F344 and WKY rat strains. To test this hypothesis, first we identified differentially expressed genes within the &lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt; QTL in the hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal cortex of F344 and WKY male rats using genome-wide microarray analyses. Genes with both expression differences and non-synonymous sequence variations in their coding regions were considered candidate quantitative trait genes (QTGs). As a proof-of-concept, the F344.WKY-&lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt; congenic strain was generated with the &lt;i&gt;Stresp10&lt;/i&gt; WKY donor region into the F344 recipient strain. This congenic strain showed behavioral phenotypes similar to those of WKYs.

P5B ATPases are present in the genomes of diverse unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, indicating that they have an ancient origin, and that they are important for cellular fitness. Inactivation of ATP13A2, one of the four human P5B ATPases, leads to early-onset Parkinson’s disease (Kufor-Rakeb Syndrome). The presence of an invariant PPALP motif within the putative substrate interaction pocket of transmembrane segment M4 suggests that all P5B ATPases might have similar transport specificity; however, the identity of the transport substrate(s) remains unknown. Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis possess three paralogous P5B ATPase genes, &lt;i&gt;catp-5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;catp-6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-7&lt;/i&gt;, which probably originated from a single ancestral gene around the time of origin of the Caenorhabditid clade. By using CRISPR/Cas9, we have systematically investigated the expression patterns, subcellular localization and biological functions of each of the P5B ATPases of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We find that each gene has a unique expression pattern, and that some tissues express more than one P5B. In some tissues where their expression patterns overlap, different P5Bs are targeted to different subcellular compartments (e.g., early endosomes vs. plasma membrane), whereas in other tissues they localize to the same compartment (plasma membrane). We observed lysosomal co-localization between CATP-6::GFP and LMP-1::RFP in transgenic animals; however, this was an artifact of the tagged LMP-1 protein, since anti-LMP-1 antibody staining of native protein revealed that LMP-1 and CATP-6::GFP occupy different compartments. The nematode P5Bs are at least partially redundant, since we observed synthetic sterility in &lt;i&gt;catp-5(0); catp-6(0)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-6(0) catp-7(0)&lt;/i&gt; double mutants.

Rhizobacteria associated with crops constitute an important source of potentially beneficial microorganisms with plant growth promoting activity or antagonistic effects against phytopathogens. In this study, we evaluated the plant growth promoting activity of 11 bacterial isolates that were obtained from the rhizosphere of healthy avocado trees and from that of avocado trees having survived root rot infestations. Seven bacterial isolates, belonging to the genera &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arthrobacter&lt;/i&gt;, promoted &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; growth of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. These isolates were then tested for antagonistic activity against &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt;, in direct dual culture assays. Two of those rhizobacterial isolates, obtained from symptomatic-declining trees, displayed antagonistic activity. Isolate A8a, which is closely related to &lt;i&gt;Bacillus acidiceler&lt;/i&gt;, was also able to inhibit &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; growth &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by 76% through the production of volatile compounds. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) and analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) allowed to tentatively identify the main volatiles emitted by isolate A8a as 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, 6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-one and 3-amino-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one. These volatile compounds have been reported to show antifungal activity when produced by other bacterial isolates. These results confirm the significance of rhizobacteria and suggest that these bacteria could be used for biocontrol of soil borne oomycetes through their volatiles emissions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b5a3221c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfonso Méndez-Bravo, Elvis Marian Cortazar-Murillo, Edgar Guevara-Avendaño, Oscar Ceballos-Luna, Benjamín Rodríguez-Haas, Ana L.

Scant research is available on the impact of the current economic crisis and austerity policies on inequality in health services utilisation in Europe. This study aimed to describe the trends in horizontal inequity in the use of health services in Andalusia, Spain, during the early years of the Great Recession, and the contribution of demographic, economic and social factors. Consultation with a general practitioner (GP) and specialist, hospitalisation and emergency care were studied through the Andalusian Health Survey 2007 (pre-crisis) and 2011–2012 (crisis), using a composite income index as socioeconomic status (SES) indicator. Horizontal inequity indices (HII) were calculated to take differential healthcare needs into account, and a decomposition analysis of change in inequality between periods was performed. Results showed that before the crisis, the HII was positive (greater access for people with higher SES) for specialist visits but negative (greater access for people with lower SES) in the other three utilisation models. During the crisis no change was observed in inequalities in GP visits, but a pro-poor development was seen for the other types of utilisation, with hospital and emergency care showing significant inequality in favour of low income groups. Overall, the main contributors to pro-poor changes in utilisation were socio-economic variables and poor mental health, due to changes in their elasticities. Our findings show that inequalities in healthcare utilisation largely remained in favour of the less well-off, despite the cuts in welfare benefits and health services provision during the early years of the recession in Andalusia. Further research is needed to monitor the potential impact of such measures in subsequent years.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d99bca9c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Antonio Córdoba-Doña, Antonio Escolar-Pujolar, Miguel San Sebastián, Per E.

Background &lt;p&gt;This study was aimed to estimate life expectancy (LE), disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and disabled life expectancy (DLE) among older adults from Santiago, Chile, and to determine the existence of differences by gender and by body mass index (BMI) categories in these indicators.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A sample of 1216 people aged 60 or more, from the Chilean cohort of the Study of Health, Ageing and Well-Being was recruited in 2000; two follow-up assessments were carried out in a 10-year period. Functional limitation was assessed through self-report of difficulties in activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living and mobility. BMI was determined with measured weight and height. Multistate life tables were employed to estimate LE and healthy life expectancy (HLE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At 60 years, women could expect to live on average an additional 20.4 years (95% CI 19.0–21.6), and men an additional 16.4 years (95% CI 14.9–17.7). Total LE was longer among women at all ages, but they had a higher proportion of disabled years to be lived compared to men, with a difference of 14% at 60 years, and 10% at 90 years. There were no significant differences in LE, DFLE and DLE between BMI categories.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Despite a longer LE, Chilean older women expect to live a higher proportion of years with disabilities, compared to men.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To explore the relation between cigarette smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness at first diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients diagnosed with urinary bladder cancer (BC) between 1995–2011 under the age of 75 years were retrospectively identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and invited for a study on genetic and lifestyle risk factors for BC. Information on patients’ self-reported smoking history was retrieved by means of a postal questionnaire. Tumors were stratified regarding the risk of progression defined by tumor stage and grade. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the relation between smoking intensity and aggressiveness of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The UBC study population comprised 323 (17.4%) never smokers, 870 (46.8%) former cigarette smokers, and 630 (33.9%) current cigarette smokers. A higher smoking amount was a risk factor of getting high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) compared with low-risk NMIBC in ever and former cigarette smokers (OR: 1.02 per cigarette smoked, 95% CI: 1.00–1.03 and OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.05, respectively). A statistically significant dose-response increase in the risk of a more aggressive cancer type (high-risk NMIBC and MIBC) was observed with increasing smoking duration among former smokers (p for trend 0.035 and 0.008, respectively). No significant association of the evaluated smoking intensity variables was observed in current smokers. A longer time of smoking cessation correlated with a lower odds of a more aggressive cancer.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;We observed a weak increase in the risk of a more aggressive tumor type with increasing smoking intensity in former smokers, but this association was absent in current smokers.This conflicting result may suggest that there is no strong relation between smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness.

&lt;i&gt;Leishmania (V&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) braziliensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Leishmania(L&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) amazonensis&lt;/i&gt; are the most pathogenic agents of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Brazil, causing a wide spectrum of clinical and immunopathological manifestations, including: localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL&lt;sup&gt;DTH+/++&lt;/sup&gt;), borderline disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis (BDCL&lt;sup&gt;DTH±&lt;/sup&gt;), anergic diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (ADCL&lt;sup&gt;DTH-&lt;/sup&gt;), and mucosal leishmaniasis (ML&lt;sup&gt;DTH++++&lt;/sup&gt;). It has recently been demonstrated, however, that while &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;.) &lt;i&gt;braziliensis&lt;/i&gt; shows a clear potential to advance the infection from central LCL (a moderate T-cell hypersensitivity form) towards ML (the highest T-cell hypersensitivity pole), &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;.) &lt;i&gt;amazonensis&lt;/i&gt; drives the infection in the opposite direction to ADCL (the lowest T-cell hypersensitivity pole). This study evaluated by immunohistochemistry the expression of &lt;i&gt;Toll-like&lt;/i&gt; receptors (&lt;i&gt;TLRs&lt;/i&gt;) 2, 4, and 9 and their relationships with CD4 and CD8 T-cells, and TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-β cytokines in that disease spectrum. Biopsies of skin and mucosal lesions from 43 patients were examined: 6 cases of ADCL, 5 of BDCL, and 11 of LCL caused by&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;.) &lt;i&gt;amazonensis&lt;/i&gt;; as well as 10 cases of LCL, 4 of BDCL, and 6 of ML caused by&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;.) &lt;i&gt;braziliensis&lt;/i&gt;. CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells demonstrated their highest expression in ML and, in contrast, their lowest in ADCL. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells also showed their lowest expression in ADCL as compared to the other forms of the disease. TNF-α&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;showed increased expression from ADCL to ML, while IL-10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;and TGF-β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; showed increased expression in the opposite direction, from ML to ADCL. With regards to &lt;i&gt;TLR&lt;/i&gt;2, 4, and 9 expressions, strong interactions of &lt;i&gt;TLR&lt;/i&gt;2 and 4 with clinical forms associated with &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;.) &lt;i&gt;braziliensis&lt;/i&gt; were observed, while &lt;i&gt;TLR&lt;/i&gt;9, in contrast, showed a strong interaction with clinical forms linked to &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;i&gt;Leishmania (V&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) braziliensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Leishmania(L&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) amazonensis&lt;/i&gt; are the most pathogenic agents of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Brazil, causing a wide spectrum of clinical and immunopathological manifestations, including: localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL&lt;sup&gt;DTH+/++&lt;/sup&gt;), borderline disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis (BDCL&lt;sup&gt;DTH±&lt;/sup&gt;), anergic diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (ADCL&lt;sup&gt;DTH-&lt;/sup&gt;), and mucosal leishmaniasis (ML&lt;sup&gt;DTH++++&lt;/sup&gt;). It has recently been demonstrated, however, that while &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;.) &lt;i&gt;braziliensis&lt;/i&gt; shows a clear potential to advance the infection from central LCL (a moderate T-cell hypersensitivity form) towards ML (the highest T-cell hypersensitivity pole), &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;.) &lt;i&gt;amazonensis&lt;/i&gt; drives the infection in the opposite direction to ADCL (the lowest T-cell hypersensitivity pole). This study evaluated by immunohistochemistry the expression of &lt;i&gt;Toll-like&lt;/i&gt; receptors (&lt;i&gt;TLRs&lt;/i&gt;) 2, 4, and 9 and their relationships with CD4 and CD8 T-cells, and TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-β cytokines in that disease spectrum. Biopsies of skin and mucosal lesions from 43 patients were examined: 6 cases of ADCL, 5 of BDCL, and 11 of LCL caused by&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;.) &lt;i&gt;amazonensis&lt;/i&gt;; as well as 10 cases of LCL, 4 of BDCL, and 6 of ML caused by&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;.) &lt;i&gt;braziliensis&lt;/i&gt;. CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells demonstrated their highest expression in ML and, in contrast, their lowest in ADCL. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells also showed their lowest expression in ADCL as compared to the other forms of the disease. TNF-α&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;showed increased expression from ADCL to ML, while IL-10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;and TGF-β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; showed increased expression in the opposite direction, from ML to ADCL. With regards to &lt;i&gt;TLR&lt;/i&gt;2, 4, and 9 expressions, strong interactions of &lt;i&gt;TLR&lt;/i&gt;2 and 4 with clinical forms associated with &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;.) &lt;i&gt;braziliensis&lt;/i&gt; were observed, while &lt;i&gt;TLR&lt;/i&gt;9, in contrast, showed a strong interaction with clinical forms linked to &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;.) &lt;i&gt;amazonensis&lt;/i&gt;. These findings strongly suggest the ability of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;Segmentation of heterogeneous patient populations into parsimonious and relatively homogenous groups with similar healthcare needs can facilitate healthcare resource planning and development of effective integrated healthcare interventions for each segment. We aimed to apply a data-driven, healthcare utilization-based clustering analysis to segment a regional health system patient population and validate its discriminative ability on 4-year longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality data.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We extracted data from the Singapore Health Services Electronic Health Intelligence System, an electronic medical record database that included healthcare utilization (inpatient admissions, specialist outpatient clinic visits, emergency department visits, and primary care clinic visits), mortality, diseases, and demographics for all adult Singapore residents who resided in and had a healthcare encounter with our regional health system in 2012. Hierarchical clustering analysis (Ward’s linkage) and K-means cluster analysis using age and healthcare utilization data in 2012 were applied to segment the selected population. These segments were compared using their demographics (other than age) and morbidities in 2012, and longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 146,999 subjects, five distinct patient segments “Young, healthy”; “Middle age, healthy”; “Stable, chronic disease”; “Complicated chronic disease” and “Frequent admitters” were identified. Healthcare utilization patterns in 2012, morbidity patterns and demographics differed significantly across all segments. The “Frequent admitters” segment had the smallest number of patients (1.79% of the population) but consumed 69% of inpatient admissions, 77% of specialist outpatient visits, 54% of emergency department visits, and 23% of primary care clinic visits in 2012. 11.5% and 31.2% of this segment has end stage renal failure and malignancy respectively. The validity of cluster-analysis derived segments is supported by discriminative ability for longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016. Incident rate ratios for healthcare utilization and Cox hazards ratio for mortality increased as patient segments increased in complexity. Patients in the “Frequent admitters” segment accounted for a disproportionate healthcare utilization and 8.16 times higher mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our data-driven clustering analysis on a general patient population in Singapore identified five patient segments with distinct longitudinal healthcare utilization patterns and mortality risk to provide an evidence-based segmentation of a regional health system’s healthcare needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>dfc2be54</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lian Leng Low, Shi Yan, Yu Heng Kwan, Chuen Seng Tan, Julian Thumboo&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The study aimed to describe the evolution of the seroprevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients included in two cohorts in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively collected the information on demographic and clinical characteristics of 4,025 and 3,856 HIV-positive Taiwanese, who were aged 18 years or older at designated hospitals around Taiwan in 2004–2007, when an outbreak of HIV infection was occurring, and 2012–2016, when the outbreak was controlled with the implementation of harm reduction program, respectively. Comparisons of HCV seropositivity were made among different age and risk groups for HIV transmission between these two cohorts.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The overall HCV seroprevalence of the 2004–2007 cohort and 2012–2016 cohort was 43.4% (1,288/2,974) and 18.6% (707/3,793), respectively (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The HCV seroprevalence among injecting drug users (IDUs), though decreasing, was constantly high across the two cohorts, 96.4% and 94.0% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), respectively, and all age groups.

Powdery mildew is a widespread fungal plant disease that can cause significant losses in many crops. Some &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; genes (&lt;i&gt;Mildew resistance locus O&lt;/i&gt;) have proved to confer a durable resistance to powdery mildew in several species. Resistance granted by the &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; gene family members has prompted an increasing interest in characterizing these genes and implementing their use in plant breeding. Lentil (&lt;i&gt;Lens culinaris&lt;/i&gt; Medik.) is a widely grown food legume almost exclusively consumed as dry seed with an average world production of 4.5 million tons. Powdery mildew causes severe losses on certain lentil cultivars under particular environmental conditions. Data mining of the lentil CDC Redberry draft genome allowed to identify up to 15 gene sequences with homology to known &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; genes, designated as &lt;i&gt;LcMLOs&lt;/i&gt;. Further characterization of these gene sequences and their deduced protein sequences demonstrated conformity with key MLO protein characteristics such as the presence of transmembrane and calmodulin binding domains, as well as that of other conserved motifs. Phylogenetic and other comparative analyses revealed that &lt;i&gt;LcMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LcMLO3&lt;/i&gt; are the most likely gene orthologs related to powdery mildew response in other species, sharing a high similarity with other known resistance genes of dicot species, such as pea &lt;i&gt;PsMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula MtMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MtMLO3&lt;/i&gt;. Sets of primers were designed as tools to PCR amplify the genomic sequences of &lt;i&gt;LcMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LcMLO3&lt;/i&gt;, also to screen lentil germplasm in search of resistance mutants. Primers were used to obtain the complete sequences of these two genes in all of the six wild lentil relatives. Respective to each gene, all &lt;i&gt;Lens&lt;/i&gt; sequences shared a high similarity. Likewise, we used these primers to screen a working collection of 58 cultivated and 23 wild lentil accessions in search of length polymorphisms present in these two genes.

Background &lt;p&gt;The need to evaluate the human health safety of fishery resources remain urgent in the mist of the ever-increasing fear of heavy metal toxicity from the consumption of Ghana’s fisheries resource, as a consequence of pollution from several anthropogenic activities including artisanal gold mining. Nevertheless, the bigeye grunt (&lt;i&gt;Brachydeuterus auritus&lt;/i&gt;) and Bagrid catfish (&lt;i&gt;Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt;) remain commercially valuable fish species in West Africa and continue to attract high patronage.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Forty-five specimens each of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; collected from the Weija Dam and the Tema Fishing Habour in Ghana, between June and September 2016, were analysed for seven heavy metals using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Lead and Cadmium were below detection in all samples while Cu was not detected in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;. Levels of the remaining metals (mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) were below FAO/WHO maximum permissible limits in fish and occurred in the rank order Se (3.5) &gt; Zn (2.34) &gt; Cu (0.59) &gt; As (0.37) &gt; Hg (0.19) in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and Se (2.97) &gt; Zn (2.28) &gt; Hg (0.31) &gt; As (0.21) in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;. Only As in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; recorded Estimated Weekly Intake (EWI) greater than FAO/WHO Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI). Also, As in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and Hg in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; had Targeted Hazard Quotient (THQ) greater than 1 for individuals consuming the fishes on daily basis and therefore, raising concerns. However, for both species of fish, cancer risk of As was 1 in 10,000,000,000 and modified Health Benefits values of Se (HBV&lt;sub&gt;Se&lt;/sub&gt;) were positive indicating the health risks that might accompany Hg exposure would be negated. Since toxicity depends on the concentration and quantity of a pollutant consumed, safe maximum consumption rate of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; based on As concentrations was 0.21 mg per day and that of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; was 0.058 mg per day for Hg.

Background &lt;p&gt;The need to evaluate the human health safety of fishery resources remain urgent in the mist of the ever-increasing fear of heavy metal toxicity from the consumption of Ghana’s fisheries resource, as a consequence of pollution from several anthropogenic activities including artisanal gold mining. Nevertheless, the bigeye grunt (&lt;i&gt;Brachydeuterus auritus&lt;/i&gt;) and Bagrid catfish (&lt;i&gt;Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt;) remain commercially valuable fish species in West Africa and continue to attract high patronage.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Forty-five specimens each of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; collected from the Weija Dam and the Tema Fishing Habour in Ghana, between June and September 2016, were analysed for seven heavy metals using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Lead and Cadmium were below detection in all samples while Cu was not detected in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;. Levels of the remaining metals (mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) were below FAO/WHO maximum permissible limits in fish and occurred in the rank order Se (3.5) &gt; Zn (2.34) &gt; Cu (0.59) &gt; As (0.37) &gt; Hg (0.19) in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and Se (2.97) &gt; Zn (2.28) &gt; Hg (0.31) &gt; As (0.21) in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;. Only As in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; recorded Estimated Weekly Intake (EWI) greater than FAO/WHO Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI). Also, As in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and Hg in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; had Targeted Hazard Quotient (THQ) greater than 1 for individuals consuming the fishes on daily basis and therefore, raising concerns. However, for both species of fish, cancer risk of As was 1 in 10,000,000,000 and modified Health Benefits values of Se (HBV&lt;sub&gt;Se&lt;/sub&gt;) were positive indicating the health risks that might accompany Hg exposure would be negated. Since toxicity depends on the concentration and quantity of a pollutant consumed, safe maximum consumption rate of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; based on As concentrations was 0.21 mg per day and that of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; was 0.058 mg per day for Hg. With an average of 0.227 kg fish per meal of an adult human, these translated into not more than 24 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and nine (9) &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; meals in a month but because fish is consumed at 0.0685 kg per person per day in Ghana, these values respectively translates to 93 and 30 safe days of consumption per month.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;At the rate of 0.0685 kg fish per person per day that fish is consumed in Ghana, the consumption of the two species of fish in Ghana would essentially be of little or no consequence to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Risk of heavy metal ingestion from the consumption of two commercially valuable species of fish from the fresh and coastal waters of Ghana</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51ce:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194682</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194682</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521838800000</published><author><name>Francis Gbogbo</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521826743954</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023281?af=R</originId><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><fingerprint>4b1147ec</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><title>Solitonic natural orbitals</title><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b67:7c9981b6</id><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023281?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023281?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><published>1522988918000</published><author><name>Jerzy Cioslowski</name></author><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1523085743269</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/67.full</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Physics, Applied, Materials Science</item></keywords><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices.

Microbes usually exist in communities consisting of myriad different but interacting species. These interactions are typically mediated through environmental modifications; microbes change the environment by taking up resources and excreting metabolites, which affects the growth of both themselves and also other microbes. We show here that the way microbes modify their environment and react to it sets the interactions within single-species populations and also between different species. A very common environmental modification is a change of the environmental pH. We find experimentally that these pH changes create feedback loops that can determine the fate of bacterial populations; they can either facilitate or inhibit growth, and in extreme cases will cause extinction of the bacterial population. Understanding how single species change the pH and react to these changes allowed us to estimate their pairwise interaction outcomes. Those interactions lead to a set of generic interaction motifs—bistability, successive growth, extended suicide, and stabilization—that may be independent of which environmental parameter is modified and thus may reoccur in different microbial systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/64piOgqCVHQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>de71fdc3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christoph Ratzke, Jeff Gore&lt;/p&gt;

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming increasingly integrated into oncological practice and clinical research. NGS methods have also provided evidence for clonal evolution of cancers during disease progression and treatment. The number of variants associated with response to specific therapeutic agents keeps increasing. However, the identification of novel driver mutations as opposed to passenger (phenotypically silent or clinically irrelevant) mutations remains a major challenge. We conducted targeted exome sequencing of advanced solid tumors from 44 pre-treated patients with solid tumors including breast, colorectal and lung carcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomas and others. We catalogued established driver mutations and putative new drivers as predicted by two distinct algorithms. The established drivers we detected were consistent with published observations. However, we also detected a significant number of mutations with driver potential never described before in each tumor type we studied. These putative drivers belong to key cell fate regulatory networks, including potentially druggable pathways. Should our observations be confirmed, they would support the hypothesis that new driver mutations are selected by treatment in clinically aggressive tumors, and indicate a need for longitudinal genomic testing of solid tumors to inform second line cancer treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a1491f56</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antonio Pannuti, Aleksandra Filipovic, Chindo Hicks, Elliot Lefkowitz, Travis Ptacek, Justin Stebbing, Lucio Miele&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; isolates sharing identical DNA fingerprint patterns can be epidemiologically linked. However, municipal health services in the Netherlands are able to confirm an epidemiological link in only around 23% of the patients with isolates clustered by the conventional variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genotyping. This research aims to investigate whether whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a more reliable predictor of epidemiological links between tuberculosis patients than VNTR genotyping.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;VNTR genotyping and WGS were performed in parallel on all &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; complex isolates received at the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in 2016. Isolates were clustered by VNTR when they shared identical 24-loci VNTR patterns; isolates were assigned to a WGS cluster when the pair-wise genetic distance was ≤ 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Cluster investigation was performed by municipal health services on all isolates clustered by VNTR in 2016. The proportion of epidemiological links identified among patients clustered by either method was calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 535 isolates were genotyped, of which 25% (134/535) were clustered by VNTR and 14% (76/535) by WGS; the concordance between both typing methods was 86%. The proportion of epidemiological links among WGS clustered cases (57%) was twice as common than among VNTR clustered cases (31%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;When WGS was applied, the number of clustered isolates was halved, while all epidemiologically linked cases remained clustered. WGS is therefore a more reliable tool to predict epidemiological links between tuberculosis cases than VNTR genotyping and will allow more efficient transmission tracing, as epidemiological investigations based on false clustering can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c5d67f74</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rana Jajou, Albert de Neeling, Rianne van Hunen, Gerard de Vries, Henrieke Schimmel, Arnout Mulder, Richard Anthony, Wim van der Hoek, Dick van Soolingen&lt;/p&gt;

For CyberKnife-mediated prostate cancer treatment, a tumour-tracking approach is applied to correct the target location by acquiring X-ray images of implanted fiducial markers intermittently. This study investigated the dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion during CyberKnife treatment. We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients treated using the CyberKnife (35 Gy delivered in five fractions). Using log files of recorded prostate motion, the intra-fraction prostate motion was simulated. We defined the worst-case intra-fraction prostate motion as the difference between pre- and post-deviation on log files and shifted structure sets according to the corresponding offsets for each beam. The dose–volume indices were calculated and compared with the original plan in terms of clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (CTV plus a 2-mm margin), rectum, bladder, and urethra. Prostate motions of &gt;3, &gt;5, and &gt;10 mm were observed for 31.3, 9.1, and 0.5% of the 1929 timestamps, respectively. Relative differences between the simulated and original plans were mostly less than 1%. Although significant decreases were observed in D&lt;sub&gt;50%&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;98%&lt;/sub&gt; of the target, absolute dose differences were &amp;lt;0.1 Gy compared with the planned dose. The dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion may be small even with longer treatment durations, indicating that the tumour tracking using the CyberKnife could be a robust system for examining prostate motion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9e0317df</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuhei Koike, Iori Sumida, Hirokazu Mizuno, Hiroya Shiomi, Keita Kurosu, Seiichi Ota, Yasuo Yoshioka, Osamu Suzuki, Keisuke Tamari, Kazuhiko Ogawa&lt;/p&gt;

It is an absolute requirement that every time you write about graphene that you mention that the breakthrough in its isolation came from the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0218/230218-graphene-sticky-tape&quot;&gt;adhesive tape&lt;/a&gt;, a low-tech insight at Manchester that led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/&quot;&gt;Nobel&lt;/a&gt; and kicked off a massive field of research. The latest is that earlier this month, a group at MIT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02773-w&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that if you bring two graphene sheets together, parallel but at a slightly different rotational angle (about 1.1 degrees), that the system becomes a superconductor at low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was already unexpected, but the behavior of the material (electron density versus temperature) suggests some real similarities to the copper-oxide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity&quot;&gt;high-temperature superconductors&lt;/a&gt;, and no one saw that coming, either. (Note that “high temperature”, in this field, still means “can be reached in liquid nitrogen as opposed to liquid helium”). Despite a really impressive amount of theoretical and experimental work on the cuprate materials, the full details of their superconductivity are still a matter of debate. It seems to come down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair&quot;&gt;Cooper pairs&lt;/a&gt; (as with the classic low-temperature superconductors, but the mechanism of the electron pairing is different and in ways that still start arguments. This new graphene systems might be able to shed some light on the various proposals, and you can be certain that a great deal of late-night coffee has been consumed in recent weeks to come up with appropriate experiments along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical value of such an understanding could well be huge (and there is, of course, another near-certain Nobel in physics waiting for whoever puts the field on a firmer basis). To give another recent MIT-related example, new superconductor engineering is at the heart of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-newly-formed-company-launch-novel-approach-fusion-power-0309&quot;&gt;recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; the university made about fusion power. The belief is that large-bore magnets of such materials, which now appear feasible, could allow a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak&quot;&gt;tokamak&lt;/a&gt;-design fusion reactor that is far more compact than any previous attempts. Wrestling with the magnets is one of the biggest problems in designing such machines, because you need extremely strong, extremely homogeneous fields. The high-temperature superconductors were recognized early on as having great possibilities in this area, but the first fusion reactor that used only these materials only became operational in 2014 (a spherical tokamak design at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Tokamak Energy&lt;/a&gt; in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphene-layer materials are still operating at very low temperatures – but considering their electron density, it’s actually a lot higher than it should be. No one is going to be make fusion reactors with twisted-graphite magnets any time soon, but twisted graphite might possibly be the platform that leads us to the magnets that fusion reactors will use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a689cbeb</fingerprint><description>I wanted to mention something on the border between chemistry and physics that might well turn out to be important.

We conclude that capillary pericytes do express α-SMA, which rapidly depolymerizes during tissue fixation thus evading detection by immunolabeling.</description><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34861</originId><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16249583648:37a25de:34f43e70</id><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34861</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34861</href></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1521590400000</published><author><name>myemisciozkan@gmail.com (Adriana Di Polo)</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>21</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521648940616</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.28</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accelerating the development of therapeutic strategies for drug-resistant tuberculosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accelerating the development of therapeutic strategies for drug-resistant tuberculosis, Published online: 23 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.28&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Recent progress in the discovery, development and evaluation of new drugs and combination regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis through greater collaboration between industry, donors and academia provides renewed hope for overcoming the challenges in tuberculosis treatment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/flgs4CyVM0k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>92cccee6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accelerating the development of therapeutic strategies for drug-resistant tuberculosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accelerating the development of therapeutic strategies for drug-resistant tuberculosis, Published online: 23 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.28&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Recent progress in the discovery, development and evaluation of new drugs and combination regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis through greater collaboration between industry, donors and academia provides renewed hope for overcoming the challenges in tuberculosis treatment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/flgs4CyVM0k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><title>Accelerating the development of therapeutic strategies for drug-resistant tuberculosis</title><id>YLwIhSxZAzQIEnJq1FGGcXUQMCbQUlr9cyNMExMVeyY=_16251471479:44c04f9:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.28</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/flgs4CyVM0k/nrd.2018.28</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId></origin><published>1521788400000</published><author><name>Michael J.

Background &lt;p&gt;The ageing population and the expected increase in the number of elderly patients make an evidence-based assessment of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in old patients progressively more important. Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO results for patient aged &amp;lt;65 years is well known. However, the risk profile and in-hospital prognosis of advanced age patients with ECMO still need more investigation. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predicted the outcomes for elderly patients who received VA-ECMO.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this retrospective study, medical records for patients with ECMO aged 65 years and over were collected between 2009 and 2012 at a tertiary hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 99 patients (mean age: 76.4±6.4 years) were included. The most common condition requiring VA-ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. Among survivors on VA-ECMO, 28 (28.3%) patients were successfully weaned from support. Thirteen (13.1%) patients were successfully discharged. We found that cardiogenic shock (OR = 3.158, P = 0.013), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR = 1.147, P&amp;lt;0.001), and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) score (OR = 1.054, P = 0.001) were risk factors associated with survival on VA-ECMO. By using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, the APACHE II score and SAPS II score displayed acceptable discriminative power (AUC 0.722; 0.715, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the risk of mortality increases with cardiogenic shock, higher APACHE II score, and higher SAPS II score.

More than 90% of the cases of Parkinson’s disease have unknown etiology. Gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra is the main cause of morbidity in this disease. External factors such as environmental toxins are believed to play a role in the cell loss, although the cause of the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons remains unknown. We have previously shown that aquaglyceroporin AQP9 is expressed in dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes of rodent brain. AQP9 is permeable to a broad spectrum of substrates including purines, pyrimidines, and lactate, in addition to water and glycerol. Here we test our hypothesis that AQP9 serves as an influx route for exogenous toxins and, hence, may contribute to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive) neurons. Using &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes injected with &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; cRNA, we show that AQP9 is permeable to the parkinsonogenic toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Stable expression of AQP9 in HEK cells increases their vulnerability to MPP+ and to arsenite—another parkinsonogenic toxin. Conversely, targeted deletion of &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; in mice protects nigral dopaminergic neurons against MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity. A protective effect of &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; deletion was demonstrated in organotypic slice cultures of mouse midbrain exposed to MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in mice subjected to intrastriatal injections of MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Seven days after intrastriatal MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; injections, the population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in substantia nigra is reduced by 48% in &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice compared with 67% in WT littermates. Our results show that AQP9 –selectively expressed in catecholaminergic neurons—is permeable to MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and suggest that this aquaglyceroporin contributes to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic neurons by providing an entry route for parkinsonogenic toxins. To our knowledge this is the first evidence implicating a toxin permeable membrane channel in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>76988caa</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Katja Stahl, Soulmaz Rahmani, Agnete Prydz, Nadia Skauli, Nanna MacAulay, Maria N.

Obtaining this reference panel can be challenging, prohibitively expensive and limits the ability to migrate to improved sequencing platforms and improved protocols. Methods: We developed qCNV and sCNA-seq, two distinct tools that together provide a new approach for profiling somatic copy number alterations (sCNA) through the analysis of cell free DNA (cfDNA) without a reference panel. Our approach was designed to identify sCNA from cfDNA through the analysis of a single plasma sample and a matched normal DNA sample - both of which can be obtained from the same blood draw. qCNV is an efficient method for extracting read-depth from BAM files and sCNA-seq is a method that uses a probabilistic model of read depth to infer the copy number segmentation of the tumour. We compared the results from our pipeline to the established copy number profile of a cell-line, as well as the results from the plasma-Seq analysis of cfDNA-like mixtures and real, clinical data-sets. Results: With a single, unmatched, germline reference sample, our pipeline recapitulated the known copy number profile of a cell-line and demonstrated similar results to those obtained from plasma-Seq. With less than 1X genome coverage, our approach identified clinically relevant sCNA in samples with as little as 20 % tumour DNA. When applied to plasma samples from cancer patients, our pipeline identified clinically significant mutations.

Despite large efforts, datasets with few sightings are often available for rare species of marine megafauna that typically live at low densities. This paucity of data makes modelling the habitat of these taxa particularly challenging. We tested the predictive performance of different types of species distribution models fitted to decreasing numbers of sightings. Generalised additive models (GAMs) with three different residual distributions and the presence only model MaxEnt were tested on two megafauna case studies differing in both the number of sightings and ecological niches. From a dolphin (277 sightings) and an auk (1,455 sightings) datasets, we simulated rarity with a sighting thinning protocol by random sampling (without replacement) of a decreasing fraction of sightings. Better prediction of the distribution of a rarely sighted species occupying a narrow habitat (auk dataset) was expected compared to the distribution of a rarely sighted species occupying a broad habitat (dolphin dataset). We used the original datasets to set up a baseline model and fitted additional models on fewer sightings but keeping effort constant. Model predictive performance was assessed with mean squared error and area under the curve. Predictions provided by the models fitted to the thinned-out datasets were better than a homogeneous spatial distribution down to a threshold of approximately 30 sightings for a GAM with a Tweedie distribution and approximately 130 sightings for the other models. Thinning the sighting data for the taxon with narrower habitats seemed to be less detrimental to model predictive performance than for the broader habitat taxon. To generate reliable habitat modelling predictions for rarely sighted marine predators, our results suggest (1) using GAMs with a Tweedie distribution with presence-absence data and (2) implementing, as a conservative empirical measure, at least 50 sightings in the models.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b23dbaec</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Auriane Virgili, Matthieu Authier, Pascal Monestiez, Vincent Ridoux&lt;/p&gt;

Sphingolipids are a diverse group of lipids with important roles in beta-cell biology regulating insulin folding and controlling apoptosis. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins with the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA. Here we tested the effect of L-serine supplementation on autoimmune diabetes development and blood glucose homeostasis in female NOD mice. We found that continuous supplementation of L-serine reduces diabetes incidence and insulitis score. In addition, L-serine treated mice had an improved glucose tolerance test, reduced HOMA-IR, and reduced blood glucose levels. L-serine led to a small reduction in body weight accompanied by reduced food and water intake. L-serine had no effect on pancreatic sphingolipids as measured by mass spectrometry. The data thus suggests that L-serine could be used as a therapeutic supplement in the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes and to improve blood glucose homeostasis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9077a943</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laurits J.

We present a new educational initiative called Meet-U that aims to train students for collaborative work in computational biology and to bridge the gap between education and research. Meet-U mimics the setup of collaborative research projects and takes advantage of the most popular tools for collaborative work and of cloud computing. Students are grouped in teams of 4–5 people and have to realize a project from A to Z that answers a challenging question in biology. Meet-U promotes &amp;quot;coopetition,&amp;quot; as the students collaborate within and across the teams and are also in competition with each other to develop the best final product. Meet-U fosters interactions between different actors of education and research through the organization of a meeting day, open to everyone, where the students present their work to a jury of researchers and jury members give research seminars. This very unique combination of education and research is strongly motivating for the students and provides a formidable opportunity for a scientific community to unite and increase its visibility. We report on our experience with Meet-U in two French universities with master’s students in bioinformatics and modeling, with protein–protein docking as the subject of the course. Meet-U is easy to implement and can be straightforwardly transferred to other fields and/or universities. All the information and data are available at www.meet-u.org.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uLDwRntm3uo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5045d524</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nika Abdollahi, Alexandre Albani, Eric Anthony, Agnes Baud, Mélissa Cardon, Robert Clerc, Dariusz Czernecki, Romain Conte, Laurent David, Agathe Delaune, Samia Djerroud, Pauline Fourgoux, Nadège Guiglielmoni, Jeanne Laurentie, Nathalie Lehmann, Camille Lochard, Rémi Montagne, Vasiliki Myrodia, Vaitea Opuu, Elise Parey, Lélia Polit, Sylvain Privé, Chloé Quignot, Maria Ruiz-Cuevas, Mariam Sissoko, Nicolas Sompairac, Audrey Vallerix, Violaine Verrecchia, Marc Delarue, Raphael Guérois, Yann Ponty, Sophie Sacquin-Mora, Alessandra Carbone, Christine Froidevaux, Stéphane Le Crom, Olivier Lespinet, Martin Weigt, Samer Abboud, Juliana Bernardes, Guillaume Bouvier, Chloé Dequeker, Arnaud Ferré, Patrick Fuchs, Gaëlle Lelandais, Pierre Poulain, Hugues Richard, Hugo Schweke, Elodie Laine, Anne Lopes&lt;/p&gt;

Innate immune signals regulate tissue remodeling in the periphery, but how this affects CNS synapses is largely unknown. Here, we show that the interleukin-1 family cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) is produced by developing astrocytes and is developmentally required for normal synapse numbers and neural circuit function in the spinal cord and thalamus. We find that IL-33 signals primarily to microglia under physiologic conditions, that it promotes microglial synapse engulfment, and that it can drive microglial-dependent synapse depletion in vivo.

Despite evidence that the ability to taste is weakened by obesity and can be rescued with weight loss intervention, few studies have investigated the molecular effects of obesity on the taste system. Taste bud cells undergo continual turnover even in adulthood, exhibiting an average life span of only a few weeks, tightly controlled by a balance of proliferation and cell death. Recent data reveal that an acute inflammation event can alter this balance. We demonstrate that chronic low-grade inflammation brought on by obesity reduces the number of taste buds in gustatory tissues of mice—and is likely the cause of taste dysfunction seen in obese populations—by upsetting this balance of renewal and cell death.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OTfX7eySHIY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>beb3cc5a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Kaufman, Ezen Choo, Anna Koh, Robin Dando&lt;/p&gt;

European plum (&lt;i&gt;Prunus domestica&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an ancient domesticated species cultivated in temperate areas worldwide whose genetic structure has been scarcely analyzed to date. In this study, a broad representation of Spanish European plum germplasm collected in Northeastern Spain and a representative set of reference cultivars were compared using nuclear and chloroplast markers. The number of alleles per locus detected with the SSR markers ranged from 8 to 39, with an average of 23.4 alleles, and 8 haplotypes were identified. Bayesian model-based clustering, minimum spanning networks, and the analysis of molecular variance showed the existence of a hierarchical structure. At the first level, two genetic groups were found, one containing ‘Reine Claude’ type reference cultivars altogether with ca. 25% of local genotypes, and a second one much more diverse. This latter group split in two groups, one containing most (ca. 70%) local genotypes and some old Spanish and French reference cultivars, whereas the other included 24 reference cultivars and only six local genotypes. A third partition level allowed a significant finer delineation into five groups. As a whole, the genetic structure of European plum from Northeastern Spain was shown to be complex and conditioned by a geographical proximity factor. This study not only contributes to genetic conservation and breeding for this species at the national level, but also supports the relevance of undertaking similar tasks of collection and characterization in other unexplored areas. Moreover, this kind of research could lead to future coordinated actions for the examination of the whole European plum diversity, to define conservation strategies, and could be used to better understand the genetic control of traits of horticultural interest through association mapping.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ec946bba</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jorge Urrestarazu, Pilar Errea, Carlos Miranda, Luis G.

The high risk of experiencing domestic violence (DV) among married women in India who reside in slum communities underscores the need for effective, evidence-based, and culturally-tailored primary prevention. To inform such DV primary prevention strategies for this population, we herein aimed to identify correlates of DV experience in early marriage. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, potential correlates of DV experience were explored among a geographically-clustered random sample of 100 recently-married women residing in slums in Pune, India. In multivariable regression, DV experience was associated with less educational attainment by the participant’s spouse (standardized β = -0.281, p = 0.004), less satisfaction of the spouse’s family with the &lt;i&gt;maanpaan&lt;/i&gt; (wedding-related gifts provided by the bride’s family) they received at the time of marriage (standardized β = -0.298, p&amp;lt;0.001), poorer conflict negotiation skills (standardized β = -0.308, p&amp;lt;0.001), and greater acknowledgement of DV occurrence in family and friends (standardized β = 0.436, p&amp;lt;0.001). These correlates suggest strategies that could be incorporated into future DV primary prevention interventions for this vulnerable population (i.e. promoting completion of formal education of boys alongside girls, mitigating causes of familial dowry harassment, improving conflict negotiation skills, and challenging norms surrounding DV).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>44227742</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ameeta S.

The present research addresses the question of whether regulatory-mode orientations affect self-forgiveness. We expected that people with a strong locomotion orientation would be more inclined to self-forgiveness because of their tendencies toward movement and change, which focus them on the future, whereas people with a strong assessment orientation would refrain from self-forgiveness due to their evaluative tendencies which focus them on the past. These hypotheses were supported by the results in four studies that tested the relation between regulatory modes and self-forgiveness by measuring (Studies 1, 3 and 4) and manipulating (Study 2) regulatory-mode-orientations. Finally, in Study 4 we examined more closely our hypothesis that the relation between self-forgiveness and regulatory modes is mediated by past and future temporal foci.

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts. Surprisingly, our data show that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells are significantly enhanced in the genital tract TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice during mid-stage &lt;i&gt;Chlamydial&lt;/i&gt; infection. In late-stage infections, both mouse strains developed hydrosalpinx; however, the extent of hydrosalpinx was more severe in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice.

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts. Surprisingly, our data show that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells are significantly enhanced in the genital tract TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice during mid-stage &lt;i&gt;Chlamydial&lt;/i&gt; infection. In late-stage infections, both mouse strains developed hydrosalpinx; however, the extent of hydrosalpinx was more severe in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Together, these data suggest that TLR3 promotes the clearance of &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; during early and mid-stages of genital tract infection, and that loss of TLR3 is detrimental in the development hydrosalpinx.</description><title>Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) promotes the resolution of &amp;lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&amp;lt;/i&gt; genital tract infection in congenic C57BL/6N mice</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd06d:7c9981b6</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195165</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195165</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1523048400000</published><author><name>Sebastian E.

Ocular tuberculosis (TB) commonly causes severe inflammation and vision loss in TB-endemic countries. The mechanism by which tuberculous infection becomes established in the eye is poorly understood. We have developed the zebrafish larva infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium marinum&lt;/i&gt; as a model to study the early pathogenesis of ocular TB. We find that hematogenous bacterial seeding of the eye occurs despite a functional blood retinal barrier. Prototypical early granulomas form in response to bacteria in the eye. These granulomas involve the retinal vasculature and retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex which are characteristic locations for human ocular TB. We find that peripheral blood monocytes are recruited to the nascent ocular granuloma further suggesting that the immune privileged nature of the eye is breached by this inflammatory focus.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4c6f02bb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin Takaki, Lalita Ramakrishnan, Soumyava Basu&lt;/p&gt;
