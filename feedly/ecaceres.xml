Dietary energy intake strongly linked to dialysis outcomes. We aimed to explore the optimal cut-off point of energy intake (EI) for identification of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in hemodialysis patients. The cross-sectional data of 243 hemodialysis patients from multi-dialysis centers in Taiwan was used. The dietary intake was assessed by using the three-day dietary questionnaire, and a 24-hour dietary recall, clinical and biochemical data were also evaluated. The MetS was diagnosed by the Harmonized Metabolic Syndrome criteria. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was to depict the optimal cut-off value of EI for the diagnosis of MetS. The logistic regression was also used to explore the association between inadequate EI and MetS. The optimal cut-off points of EI for identifying the MetS were 26.7 kcal/kg/day for patients aged less than 60 years, or with non-diabetes, and 26.2 kcal/kg/day for patients aged 60 years and above, or with diabetes, respectively. The likelihood of the MetS increased with lower percentiles of energy intake in hemodialysis patients. In the multivariate analysis, the inadequate dietary energy intake strongly determined 3.24 folds of the MetS.

Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20–100%, 150 BAM files in total). To demonstrate feasibility beyond exome data, we introduced read alignments to a targeted 5-gene cell-free DNA sequencing library to simulate &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; amplifications at frequencies consistent with circulating tumor DNA (10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01%) while retaining the multimodal insert size distribution of the original data. We expect Bamgineer to be of use for development and systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms by users using locally-generated data for a variety of applications.

Bruce, Trevor J. Pugh&lt;/p&gt;
Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20–100%, 150 BAM files in total). To demonstrate feasibility beyond exome data, we introduced read alignments to a targeted 5-gene cell-free DNA sequencing library to simulate &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; amplifications at frequencies consistent with circulating tumor DNA (10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01%) while retaining the multimodal insert size distribution of the original data. We expect Bamgineer to be of use for development and systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms by users using locally-generated data for a variety of applications.

Availability and Implementation: The R package DEsingle is freely available at https://github.com/miaozhun/DEsingle and is under Bioconductor&apos;s consideration now.</description><published>1522047600000</published><title>DEsingle for detecting three types of differential expression in single-cell RNA-seq data [CONFIRMATORY RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01137</originId><visual><width>449</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>500</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01137/20180330/images/medium/mp-2017-01137w_0010.gif</url></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01137</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/hRlLNP1YGEs/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01137</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522382400000</published><author><name>Evgeny Putin, Arip Asadulaev, Quentin Vanhaelen, Yan Ivanenkov, Anastasia V.

Microbes usually exist in communities consisting of myriad different but interacting species. These interactions are typically mediated through environmental modifications; microbes change the environment by taking up resources and excreting metabolites, which affects the growth of both themselves and also other microbes. We show here that the way microbes modify their environment and react to it sets the interactions within single-species populations and also between different species. A very common environmental modification is a change of the environmental pH. We find experimentally that these pH changes create feedback loops that can determine the fate of bacterial populations; they can either facilitate or inhibit growth, and in extreme cases will cause extinction of the bacterial population. Understanding how single species change the pH and react to these changes allowed us to estimate their pairwise interaction outcomes. Those interactions lead to a set of generic interaction motifs—bistability, successive growth, extended suicide, and stabilization—that may be independent of which environmental parameter is modified and thus may reoccur in different microbial systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/64piOgqCVHQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004248</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004248</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162259eed6a:49391f:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521049595242</crawled><fingerprint>de71fdc3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christoph Ratzke, Jeff Gore&lt;/p&gt;

Those interactions lead to a set of generic interaction motifs—bistability, successive growth, extended suicide, and stabilization—that may be independent of which environmental parameter is modified and thus may reoccur in different microbial systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/64piOgqCVHQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1521053823081</recrawled><published>1521061200000</published><title>Modifying and reacting to the environmental pH can drive bacterial interactions</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24022-w</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24022-w</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/VxkbeHWyBXY/s41598-018-24022-w</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plac1 Is a Key Regulator of the Inflammatory Response and Immune Tolerance In Mammary Tumorigenesis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plac1 Is a Key Regulator of the Inflammatory Response and Immune Tolerance In Mammary Tumorigenesis, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24022-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24022-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Plac1 Is a Key Regulator of the Inflammatory Response and Immune Tolerance In Mammary Tumorigenesis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/VxkbeHWyBXY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>458</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24022-w/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24022_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><author><name>Hongyan Yuan</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24022-w</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162a9b5209a:142c877:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523265642650</crawled><fingerprint>732b4a47</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plac1 Is a Key Regulator of the Inflammatory Response and Immune Tolerance In Mammary Tumorigenesis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plac1 Is a Key Regulator of the Inflammatory Response and Immune Tolerance In Mammary Tumorigenesis, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24022-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24022-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Plac1 Is a Key Regulator of the Inflammatory Response and Immune Tolerance In Mammary Tumorigenesis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/VxkbeHWyBXY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1523257200000</published><title>Plac1 Is a Key Regulator of the Inflammatory Response and Immune Tolerance In Mammary Tumorigenesis</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3182.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3182.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3182.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Cancer-initiating gatekeeper mutations that arise in stem cells would be especially potent if they stabilize and expand an affected stem cell lineage.

Background &lt;p&gt;The etiology of transient corneal haze in premature infants is not known and how it relates to clinical outcomes in premature infants is not clear.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To study associated factors of transient corneal haze in premature infants.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a retrospective study of 261 premature infants from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening in the neonatal intensive care unit at a tertiary referral hospital. Characteristics of premature infants with and without corneal haze were analyzed by correlation tests, Chi-square tests, and logistic regressions were used for statistical analyses. Associations between corneal haze and birth weight (BW), gestational age at birth (GA), central corneal thickness, intraocular pressure, and other systemic and ophthalmic data were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The incidence of corneal haze was 13.4%. Lower BW, lower GA, packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion, more days on oxygen, older maternal age, bronchopulmonary disease, and stage 3 ROP are associated with corneal haze. The severity of corneal haze decreased with infants’ postmenstrual age. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that BW and maternal age are the most important predictors of corneal haze.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Low BW and older maternal age are the most important predictors of corneal haze in premature infants. Premature infants with corneal haze could carry more systemic and ocular morbidities. Hence they may require more clinical attention. Corneal haze is unlikely to hinder the treatment of ROP. However, it is possible that corneal haze could hinder the examination of ROP in some infants.

Gut bacterial communities have been shown to be influenced by diet, host phylogeny and anatomy, but most of these studies have been done in captive animals. Here we compare the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of wild birds. We characterized the gizzard and intestinal microbiota among 8 wild Neotropical bird species, granivorous or frugivorous species of the orders Columbiformes and Passeriformes. We sequenced the V4 region of the &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene in 94 collected samples from 32 wild birds from 5 localities, and compared bacterial communities by foraging guild, organ, locality and bird taxonomy. &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene-based sequencing data were examined using QIIME with linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) and metabolic pathways were predicted using PICRUSt algorism. We identified 8 bacterial phyla, dominated by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Beta diversity analyses indicated significant separation of gut communities by bird orders (Columbiformes vs. Passerifomes) and between bird species (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In lower intestine, PICRUSt shows a predominance of carbohydrate metabolism in granivorous birds and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways in frugivorous birds. Gizzard microbiota was significantly richer in granivorous, in relation to frugivorous birds (Chao 1; non-parametric t-test, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), suggesting a microbial gizzard function, beyond grinding food. The results suggest that the most important factor separating the bacterial community structure was bird taxonomy, followed by foraging guild. However, variation between localities is also likely to be important, but this could not been assessed with our study design.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>M.

The mechanical environment is a primary factor in the success of distraction osteogenesis. It is known that the interfragmentary movement during the distraction and maturation phase effects the callus formation. In addition to cyclic compression, other movements like shear and bending influence the bone formation process as shown in previous callus distraction studies. Reports of cartilage presence and endochondral ossification in the regenerative zone have been associated with a lack of fixation stability and delayed healing. So far the effects of the direction of interfragmentary movements could not be studied separately. By means of a unique lateral callus distraction model, we investigated the effects of small (0.1 mm) and moderate (0.6 mm), purely axial compression on ossification during callus maturation in sheep. A distraction device incorporating a mobile titanium plate was mounted on the tibia. Following lateral callus distraction, electromechanically controlled movements allowed purely axial cyclic compression of the tissue regenerate. Seven weeks post-operatively, the tissue regenerates were investigated using μCT, histology and immunohistochemistry.

The mechanical environment is a primary factor in the success of distraction osteogenesis. It is known that the interfragmentary movement during the distraction and maturation phase effects the callus formation. In addition to cyclic compression, other movements like shear and bending influence the bone formation process as shown in previous callus distraction studies. Reports of cartilage presence and endochondral ossification in the regenerative zone have been associated with a lack of fixation stability and delayed healing. So far the effects of the direction of interfragmentary movements could not be studied separately. By means of a unique lateral callus distraction model, we investigated the effects of small (0.1 mm) and moderate (0.6 mm), purely axial compression on ossification during callus maturation in sheep. A distraction device incorporating a mobile titanium plate was mounted on the tibia. Following lateral callus distraction, electromechanically controlled movements allowed purely axial cyclic compression of the tissue regenerate. Seven weeks post-operatively, the tissue regenerates were investigated using μCT, histology and immunohistochemistry. The larger amplitude significantly increased bone formation (Fractional bone volume: 19.4% vs. 5.2%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03; trabecular thickness: 0.1 mm vs. 0.06 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006; mean spicule height: 2.6 mm vs. 1.1 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) however, no endochondral ossification occurred. The elimination of shear movement, unimpaired neovascularization as well as the tensile strain stimuli during the distraction phase suppressing chondrogenic differentiation may all contribute to the absence of cartilage. In clinical application of distraction osteogenesis, moderate axial interfragmentary movement augments intramembranous ossification provided shear strain is minimized.</description><published>1523048400000</published><title>Intramembranous bone formation after callus distraction is augmented by increasing axial compressive strain</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/269274v3?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/269274v3?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/269274v3?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Virus genome sequences, generated in ever-higher volumes, can provide new scientific insights and inform our responses to epidemics and outbreaks.

The occurrence of water stress during wheat growth is more frequent due to climate change. Three experiments (cyclic drought, cyclic waterlogging, and cyclic drought plus waterlogging) were conducted to investigate the effects of mild and severe cyclic/single water stress at elongation and heading stages on winter wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt; L.) yield. The effect of either mild drought at elongation or mild waterlogging at heading on wheat yield was not significant; however, significance did occur under other single water stresses. As the stress becomes more severe, the yield loss significantly increases. Extreme drought/waterlogging treatment at elongation caused a greater yield penalty than stress at heading stage. Except the combination of mild drought and mild waterlogging treatment, cyclic water stress significantly decreased wheat yields. The decrease in wheat yield under cyclic severe drought and waterlogging was significantly higher than any other treatment, with percentage decreases of 71.52 and 73.51%, respectively. In general, a yield reduction from mild cyclic water stress did not indicate more severe damage than single treatments; in contrast, grain yield suffered more when water stress occurred again after severe drought and waterlogging. Drought during elongation significantly decreased kernel number, whereas drought at heading/waterlogging during elongation and heading decreased the spike weight, which might be the main reason for the yield penalty. Furthermore, water stress caused variation in the decrease of total biomass and/or harvest index. The present study indicates comprehensive understanding of the types, degree, and stages of water stress are essential for assessing the impact of multiple water stresses on wheat yield.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Jinfeng Ding</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195535</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715295:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>84746a3f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinfeng Ding, Zhengjin Huang, Min Zhu, Chunyan Li, Xinkai Zhu, Wenshan Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Given a selection of older papers from the journal that readers were unfamiliar with, could they pick out the ones that ended up getting cited more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this work, revised and expanded, is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194903&quot;&gt;subject of a paper&lt;/a&gt; in PLOS ONE (open access, by definition), and the author line features some blog pseudonyms, interestingly. A 2003 issue of JACS was selected, and respondents were asked the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers in the issue to you think are the most ‘significant’ (your own definition of ‘significant’ is what is important here)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without looking up numbers, which three papers do you think will have been cited the most to-date?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you most want to point out to other chemists?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you want to shout about from the rooftops (i.e., tell anybody about, not just chemists)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad to say that I seem to have skewed the set of responders a bit, since it appears that many of the people who answered the survey were readers of this blog following a link. Looking over the papers that were suggested, it seems that the correlation between the first set and the third (significant, and should be shared with other chemists) was pretty strong, as you might think, but that correlation between “significant” and “will have been cited the most” was somewhat weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the correlation between what respondents thought would be the most cited articles and the actual ten-years-later citation counts was quite poor (see the paper’s Figure 1). Looking at Figure 2, you can see that none of the other questions, in fact, correlate well with the real citation counts (I would be rather unhappy if these graphs represented project assay correlations!) Of course, it’s also true that the respondents disagreed pretty significantly about which papers were significant in the first place. That’s strong evidence that the survey set was indeed composed of practicing chemists, because we rarely agree on much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there indeed differences between “interesting, thought-provoking” papers and ones that you feel like telling other chemists about? Or between those and the ones that pick up citations? These data, though far from comprehensive, suggest that both of these may be true (as does ones own intuition, for what that’s worth). The paper tries to correlate responses to the reported areas of specialization of the responders, and there may well be something to that. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja034820y&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was cited 325 times over the next ten years, but only five responders to the survey picked it as one that would get cited. All five of them, though, indicated that they specialized in this general area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja0345423&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was selected by many survey responders as one that would pick up citations, but its actual ten-year citation count was average-to-modest. My own guess here (I may have picked this one myself!) was that the title sounded like something “hot”, by current standards, and it surely would have been picked up on. But that shows you the peril of such gut feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this does is drive yet another nail into the idea that current publication-based measures to evaluate research importance, quality, and impact are much good at all. They aren’t. The paper finishes up on just this point, referencing several other initiatives that are trying to overturn citation counts, h-indices, journal impact factors and so on. These things are measures, sure enough, but they’re not necessarily measuring very much, and not necessarily what some of their users think that they’re measuring!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Back in 2013, I mentioned the “JACS Challenge”, an interesting attempt to see if papers that eventually got cited a lot were obvious prima facie.

The present study is aimed at assessing the feasibility of delivering the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine to girls through a school-based program in Hong Kong, as well as to examine the facilitators and barriers associated with their participation. We approached 1,229 eligible girls aged 9 to 14 at eight schools in Hong Kong to join the program and then delivered the bivalent HPV vaccine at 0 and 6 months over the course of one school year. The students and their parents completed separate questionnaires to indicate their decision on whether or not to participate, and to assess their knowledge of cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine. The overall vaccine uptake was 81.4% (1,000/1,229) for the first dose and 80.8% (993/1,229) for the second dose. Parents and students were given separate questionnaires and asked whether or not they would like to participate in the vaccination program. 87.1% (1,010/1,160) of parents and 84.9% (974/1,147) of students indicated that they would join the program. The reasons associated with parents’ decision not to vaccinate their daughters primarily included concerns around side effects and safety. Multivariate regression analysis showed that parents who thought that the vaccine would protect their daughter from getting cervical cancer (OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.39–7.15, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .01), and those who reported having a doctor’s recommendation (OR = 4.54, 95% CI = 1.05–19.57, p &amp;lt; .05) were more likely to join the program. In contrast, parents who had never heard of the vaccine (OR = .15, 95% CI = .03–.71, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .02), those who were willing to pay more than HK$2,000 for the vaccine (OR = .39, 95% CI = .19–.81, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05), or had a preference to access it through a private clinic (OR = .44, 95% CI = .26–.75, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .01) were significantly less likely to allow their daughter to join the program. Delivery of the HPV vaccine with high uptake rate in a school setting is feasible in Hong Kong. Engaging key stakeholders including school administrators, teachers and community physicians, and providing relevant information on safety and vaccine effectiveness to parents were important to the success of the program.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Winnie Wing Yan Yuen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194159</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e0b:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>f40dca57</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Winnie Wing Yan Yuen, Albert Lee, Paul K.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Although severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis-related diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD), there is no reliable biomarker of CAD risks in patients with OSA. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1-Abs) are associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-two adults diagnosed with OSA by polysomnography, 96 patients with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 64 healthy volunteers (HVs) were consecutively enrolled. Serum samples were collected from patients with OSA at diagnostic polysomnography and from patients with ACS at disease onset. Serum NBL1-Ab level was measured by amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay and its association with clinical variables related to atherosclerosis was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;NBL1-Ab level was significantly elevated in patients with both OSA and ACS compared with HVs. Subgroup analyses showed that NBL1-Ab level was markedly higher in patients with severe OSA and OSA patients with a history of CAD. Weak associations were observed between NBL1-Ab level and apnea-hypopnea index, age, mean SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and arousal index, whereas significantly higher NBL1-Ab levels were observed in OSA patients with a history of CAD than in those without a history of CAD. Sensitivity analysis using a logistic regression model also demonstrated that increased NBL1-Ab levels were associated with the previous history of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Elevated NBL1-Ab levels may be associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA, which needs to be confirmed further.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Takuma Matsumura</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195015</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>b0341bac</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takuma Matsumura, Jiro Terada, Taku Kinoshita, Yoriko Sakurai, Misuzu Yahaba, Kenji Tsushima, Seiichiro Sakao, Kengo Nagashima, Toshinori Ozaki, Yoshio Kobayashi, Takaki Hiwasa, Koichiro Tatsumi&lt;/p&gt;

Weak associations were observed between NBL1-Ab level and apnea-hypopnea index, age, mean SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and arousal index, whereas significantly higher NBL1-Ab levels were observed in OSA patients with a history of CAD than in those without a history of CAD. Sensitivity analysis using a logistic regression model also demonstrated that increased NBL1-Ab levels were associated with the previous history of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Elevated NBL1-Ab levels may be associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA, which needs to be confirmed further.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522357200000</published><title>Circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1): A potential biomarker for coronary artery disease in patients with obstructive sleep apnea</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03126-3</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03126-3</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03126-3</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;India and France pledge billions of dollars on solar-energy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India and France pledge billions of dollars on solar-energy, Published online: 14 March 2018;

The speed of theta brain oscillatory activity is thought to play a key role in determining working memory (WM) capacity. Individual differences in the length of a theta cycle (ranging between 4 and 7 Hz) might determine how many gamma cycles (&gt;30 Hz) can be nested into a theta wave. Gamma cycles are thought to represent single memory items; therefore, this interplay could determine individual memory capacity. We directly tested this hypothesis by means of parietal transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) set at slower (4 Hz) and faster (7 Hz) theta frequencies during a visuospatial WM paradigm. Accordingly, we found that 4-Hz tACS enhanced WM capacity, while 7-Hz tACS reduced WM capacity. Notably, these effects were found only for items presented to the hemifield contralateral to the stimulation site. This provides causal evidence for a frequency-dependent and spatially specific organization of WM storage, supporting the theta–gamma phase coupling theory of WM capacity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CD9CmLoVDB8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005348</href></item></canonical><engagement>67</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005348</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162259eed6a:493923:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521049595242</crawled><fingerprint>11c99faa</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nina Wolinski, Nicholas R.

We investigate the influence of the visual appearance of a negotiator on persuasiveness within the context of negotiations. Psychological experiments were conducted to quantitatively analyze the relationship between visual appearance and the use of language. Male and female participants were shown three female and male photographs, respectively. They were asked to report how they felt about each photograph using a seven-point semantic differential (SD) scale for six affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness). Participants then answered how they felt about each negotiation scenario (they were presented with pictures and a situation combined with negotiation sentences) using a seven-point SD scale for seven affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, and degree of persuasion). Two experiments were conducted using different participant groups depending on the negotiation situations. Photographs with good or bad appearances were found to show high or low degrees of persuasion, respectively. A multiple regression equation was obtained, indicating the importance of the three language factors (euphemistic, honorific, and sympathy expressions) to impressions made during negotiation. The result shows that there are optimal negotiation sentences based on various negotiation factors, such as visual appearance and use of language. For example, persons with good appearance might worsen their impression during negotiations by using certain language, although their initial impression was positive, and persons with bad appearance could effectively improve their impressions in negotiations through their use of language, although the final impressions of their negotiation counterpart might still be more negative than those for persons with good appearance. In contrast, the impressions made by persons of normal appearance were not easily affected by their use of language. The results of the present study have significant implications for future studies of effective negotiation strategies considering visual appearance as well as gender.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Maki Sakamoto</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195496</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d739:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>c300347c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maki Sakamoto, Jinhwan Kwon, Hikaru Tamada, Yumi Hirahara&lt;/p&gt;

Without the RPE, a majority of overlying photoreceptors ultimately degenerate, leading to severe, progressive vision loss. Clinical and histological studies suggest that RPE replacement strategies may delay disease progression or restore vision. A prospective, interventional, U.S. Food and Drug Administration–cleared, phase 1/2a study is being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of a composite subretinal implant in subjects with advanced NNAMD. The composite implant, termed the California Project to Cure Blindness–Retinal Pigment Epithelium 1 (CPCB-RPE1), consists of a polarized monolayer of human embryonic stem cell–derived RPE (hESC-RPE) on an ultrathin, synthetic parylene substrate designed to mimic Bruch’s membrane. We report an interim analysis of the phase 1 cohort consisting of five subjects. Four of five subjects enrolled in the study successfully received the composite implant. In all implanted subjects, optical coherence tomography imaging showed changes consistent with hESC-RPE and host photoreceptor integration.

As many similar symptoms are reported in fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), underlying defcits may potentially also be similar. Postural disequilibrium reported in both conditions may thus be explained by similar deviations in postural control strategies. 75 females (25/group FM, CFS and control, age 19–49 years) performed 60 s of quiet standing on a force platform in each of three conditions: 1) firm surface with vision, 2) firm surface without vision and, 3) compliant surface with vision. Migration of center of pressure was decomposed into a slow and a fast component denoting postural sway and lateral forces controlling postural sway, analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Main effects of group for the antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions showed that patients displayed larger amplitudes (AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.021) and lower frequencies (AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) for the slow component, as well as for the fast component (amplitudes: AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001 and frequencies: AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029) compared to controls. Post hoc analyses showed no significant differences between patient groups. In conclusion, both the CFS- and the FM-group differed from the control group.

Feed costs account for over 70% of the annual expenditures in cow/calf production. During the production year the cow uses nutrients to support conceptus growth, milk production, work (grazing and locomotion), and maintenance requirements. The majority of the nutrients are used to support maintenance. Substrate cycling has been identified as one of the major contributors toward energy expenditure associated with maintenance in mature cows. The objective of this study was to determine whether beef cows that differ in the efficiency of weight gain differ in the relative abundance of transcripts for metabolic regulation in adipose tissue. Mature beef cows were subjected to feed restriction followed by ad libitum feed. Adipose tissue from twelve cows with high (n = 6) and low (n = 6) gain based on growth performance during the ad libitum feeding period was evaluated for transcriptome expression differences. A total of 496 genes were differentially expressed and passed Bonferroni correction for the animals with greater gain between restriction and realimentation and 491 genes were differentially expressed among animals with lesser gains between feed restriction and realimentation. Of these two differentially expressed gene lists, 144 genes were common between animals with greater and those with lesser gain. Enriched biological processes included the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, respiratory electron transport chain and fatty acid metabolic processes. Specific to adipose tissue of low gaining animals was glycolysis and to high gain animals was coenzyme, steroid, cellular amino acid, nitrogen compound metabolic processes, and sensory perception. The oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways were commonly associated with the high gain animals between feed restriction and realimentation, as well as with the low gaining animals between the two time points. Unique to the high gaining animals were valine degradation and LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function pathways. In this discovery study, genes involved in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation pathways appear to be critical to mature cows during times of abundant feed after feed restriction.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Hannah Crocker Cunningham</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194104</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d58:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>887574c9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hannah Crocker Cunningham, Kristi M.

Background &lt;p&gt;The management of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with rate-lowering or anti-arrhythmic drugs has markedly changed over the last decade, but it is unknown how these changes have affected patients with NVAF with a permanent pacemaker (PPM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Through Danish nationwide registries, patients with NVAF and a PPM were identified from 2001 to 2012. Changes in concomitant pharmacotherapy and comorbidities were tested using the Cochran–Armitage trend test and linear regression. Patients with NVAF were identified to calculate the proportional amount of PPM implants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 12,231 NVAF patients with a PPM were included in the study, 55.6% of which were men. Median age was 78 years (interquartile range 70–84). From 2001 to 2012, the number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased from 850 to 1344, while the number of NVAF patients increased from 67,478 to 127,261. Thus, the proportional amount of NVAF patients with a PPM decreased from 1.3% to 1.1% (p = 0.015). Overall 45.9% had atrial fibrillation (AF) duration less than one year and the proportion declined from 55.5% to 42.4% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Diabetes mellitus increased from 7.2% to 16.8% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Heart failure (HF) decreased from 36.7% to 29.3% (p = 0.010) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) decreased from 32.4% to 26.1% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Beta-blocker use increased from 38.1% to 58.0% (p &amp;lt;0.001), while digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drug use decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2012, the absolute number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased while the proportional amount decreased. The number of NVAF patients receiving a PPM within one year of AF diagnosis decreased. The prevalence of DM increased, while the prevalence of HF and IHD was high but decreasing. The use of beta-blockers increased markedly, while use of digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drugs decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Frederik Dalgaard</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195175</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca425c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>b6d29348</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Frederik Dalgaard, Martin H.

In 2013, a large measles epidemic occurred in the Aketi Health Zone of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We conducted a two-stage, retrospective cluster survey to estimate the attack rate, the case fatality rate, and the measles-specific mortality rate during the epidemic. 1424 households containing 7880 individuals were included. The estimated attack rate was 14.0%, (35.0% among children aged &amp;lt;5years). The estimated case fatality rate was 4.2% (6.1% among children aged &amp;lt;5years). Spatial analysis and linear regression showed that younger children, those who did not receive care, and those living farther away from Aketi Hospital early in the epidemic had a higher risk of measles related death. Vaccination coverage prior to the outbreak was low (76%), and a delayed reactive vaccination campaign contributed to the high attack rate. We provide evidences suggesting that a comprehensive case management approach reduced measles fatality during this epidemic in rural, inaccessible resource-poor setting.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Etienne Gignoux</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194276</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16225a89689:4e339a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><fingerprint>6935a1f8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Etienne Gignoux, Jonathan Polonsky, Iza Ciglenecki, Mathieu Bichet, Matthew Coldiron, Enoch Thuambe Lwiyo, Innocent Akonda, Micaela Serafini, Klaudia Porten&lt;/p&gt;

Diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon, &lt;i&gt;Salmo salar&lt;/i&gt; were fed high-protein, phosphorus-rich diets (56–60% protein; ca 18g phosphorus kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; diet) whilst being reared at low temperature from start-feeding until parr-smolt transformation. Performances of salmon fed diets based on fish meal (STD) or a mix of fishmeal and hydrolysed fish proteins (HFM) as the major protein sources were compared in terms of mortality, diet digestibility, growth and skeletal deformities. Separate groups of diploids and triploids were reared in triplicate tanks (initially 3000 fish per tank; tank biomass ca. 620 g) from 0–2745 degree-days post-start feeding (ddPSF). Growth metrics (weight, length, condition factor) were recorded at ca. 4 week intervals, external signs of deformities to the operculum, jaws and spinal column were examined in parr sampled at 1390 ddPSF, and external signs of deformity and vertebral anomalies (by radiography) were examined in fish sampled at the end of the trial (2745 ddPSF). The triploid salmon generally had a lower mass per unit length, i.e. lower condition factor, throughout the trial, but this did not seem to reflect any consistent dietary or ploidy effects on either dietary digestibility or the growth of the fish. By the end of the trial fish in all treatment groups had achieved a weight of 50+ g, and had completed the parr-smolt transformation. The triploids had slightly, but significantly, fewer vertebrae (Triploids STD 58.74 ± 0.10; HFM 58.68 ± 0.05) than the diploids (Diploids STD 58.97 ± 0.14; HFM 58.89 ± 0.01), and the incidence of skeletal (vertebral) abnormalities was higher in triploids (Triploids STD 31 ± 0.90%; HFM 15 ± 1.44%) than in diploids (Diploids STD 4 ± 0.80%; HFM 4 ± 0.83%). The HFM diet gave a significant reduction in the numbers of triploid salmon with vertebral anomalies in comparison with the triploids fed the STD diet possibly as a result of differences in phosphorus bioavailability between the two diets. Overall, the incidence of skeletal deformities was lower than reported in previous studies (Diploids 20+%, Triploids 40+%), possibly as a result of the combination of rearing at low-temperature and phosphorus-rich diets being used in the present study.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Stefano Peruzzi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194340</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:412391f:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>e03b8fb2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefano Peruzzi, Velmurugu Puvanendran, Guido Riesen, Rudi Ripman Seim, Ørjan Hagen, Silvia Martínez-Llorens, Inger-Britt Falk-Petersen, Jorge M.

Muscle atrophy (loss of skeletal muscle mass) causes progressive deterioration of skeletal function. Recently, excessive intake of fats was suggested to induce insulin resistance, followed by muscle atrophy. Green tea extracts (GTEs), which contain polyphenols such as epigallocatechin gallate, have beneficial effects on obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, but their effects against muscle atrophy are still unclear. Here, we found that GTEs prevented high-fat (HF) diet–induced muscle weight loss in senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8), a murine model of senescence. SAMP8 mice were fed a control diet, an HF diet, or HF with 0.5% GTEs (HFGT) diet for 4 months. The HF diet induced muscle weight loss with aging (measured as quadriceps muscle weight), whereas GTEs prevented this loss. In HF diet–fed mice, blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations increased in comparison with the control group, and these mice had insulin resistance as determined by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In these mice, serum concentrations of leukocyte cell–derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), which is known to induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, were elevated, and insulin signaling in muscle, as determined by the phosphorylation levels of Akt and p70 S6 kinases, tended to be decreased. In HFGT diet–fed mice, these signs of insulin resistance and elevation of serum LECT2 were not observed. Although our study did not directly show the effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, insulin resistance examined using HOMA-IR indicated an intervention effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, as revealed by partial correlation analysis. Accordingly, GTEs might have beneficial effects on age-related and HF diet–induced muscle weight loss, which correlates with insulin resistance and is accompanied by a change in serum LECT2.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Shintaro Onishi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195753</canonicalUrl><engagement>5</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a4:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>73992784</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shintaro Onishi, Mayu Ishino, Hidefumi Kitazawa, Ai Yoto, Yuki Shimba, Yusuke Mochizuki, Keiko Unno, Shinichi Meguro, Ichiro Tokimitsu, Shinji Miura&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Edwardsiella ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; is a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic rod and the causative agent of enteric septicemia of channel catfish (ESC), which is one of the most prevalent diseases of catfish, causing significant economic losses in the catfish industry. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; is resistant to complement system and macrophage killing, which results in rapid systemic septicemia. However, mechanisms of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; stress responses under conditions of host environment are not studied well. Therefore, in this work, we report &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; stress responses during hydrogen peroxide, low pH, and catfish serum stresses as well as during catfish invasion. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; stress responses were characterized by identifying expression of 13 universal stress protein (USP) genes (&lt;i&gt;usp01&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;usp13&lt;/i&gt;) and seven USP-interacting protein genes (&lt;i&gt;groEL&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;groES&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;dnaK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;grpE&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;clpB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;grpE&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;relA&lt;/i&gt;). Data indicated that three &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt; genes (&lt;i&gt;usp05&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp07&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;usp13&lt;/i&gt;) were highly expressed in all stress conditions.

&lt;i&gt;Edwardsiella ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; is a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic rod and the causative agent of enteric septicemia of channel catfish (ESC), which is one of the most prevalent diseases of catfish, causing significant economic losses in the catfish industry. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; is resistant to complement system and macrophage killing, which results in rapid systemic septicemia. However, mechanisms of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; stress responses under conditions of host environment are not studied well. Therefore, in this work, we report &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; stress responses during hydrogen peroxide, low pH, and catfish serum stresses as well as during catfish invasion. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; stress responses were characterized by identifying expression of 13 universal stress protein (USP) genes (&lt;i&gt;usp01&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;usp13&lt;/i&gt;) and seven USP-interacting protein genes (&lt;i&gt;groEL&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;groES&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;dnaK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;grpE&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;clpB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;grpE&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;relA&lt;/i&gt;). Data indicated that three &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt; genes (&lt;i&gt;usp05&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp07&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;usp13&lt;/i&gt;) were highly expressed in all stress conditions. Similarly, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; heat shock proteins &lt;i&gt;groEL&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;groES&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;dnaK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;grpE&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;clpB&lt;/i&gt; were highly expressed in oxidative stress. Also, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri grpE&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;relA&lt;/i&gt; were highly expressed in catfish spleen and head kidney. These findings contribute to our understanding of stress response mechanisms in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; stress response, and stress-related proteins that are essential for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; could be potential targets for live attenuated vaccine development against ESC.</description><published>1521493200000</published><title>Stress-related genes promote &amp;lt;i&gt;Edwardsiella ictaluri&amp;lt;/i&gt; pathogenesis</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194277</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194277</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194277</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marrit Annika Tuinman, Vicky Lehmann, Mariët Hagedoorn&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;Qualitative studies indicated that cancer survivors may be worried about finding a partner in the future, but whether this concern is warranted is unknown. We examined single people´s interest in dating a cancer survivor, how they perceive survivors’ traits, and their preferences about the timing of disclosing a cancer history.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In three experimental vignette studies, dating website members (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 324) and college students (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 138 and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 131) were randomly assigned to a vignette of a person with or without a history of cancer (experiment 1 &amp;amp; 2), or a cancer survivor beyond or during active follow-up (experiment 3). Respondents rated their interest in dating this fictive person, this person’s traits, and indicated their preferences about the timing of disclosure. ANOVAs with main and interaction effects of condition, gender, and relationship history were conducted, partial eta squared and Cohen’s &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; were used to estimate the magnitude of effects. Correlations were used to investigate relationships between interest in a date and assessment of traits.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors’ traits were assessed more positively, but interest to date them did not differ from healthy vignettes for both men and women. However, widowed respondents were much less interested in a date with a cancer survivor, and women showed less interest in a cancer survivor during active follow-up relative to survivors beyond follow-up. Most respondents wanted to hear about the cancer diagnosis after a few dates, hardly anyone wanted to hear about this before the first date (2% - 5%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion and implications for cancer survivors &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors do not have to expect any more problems in finding a date than people without a cancer history, and can wait a few dates before disclosing.

Deformed wing virus (DWV) is an important pathogen in a broad range of insects, including honey bees. Concordant with the spread of &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt;, DWV is present in the majority of honey bee colonies and can result in either low-level infections with asymptomatic bees that nonetheless exhibit increased colony loss under stress, or high-level infections with acute effects on bee health and viability. DWV can be transmitted vertically or horizontally and evidence suggests that horizontal transmission via &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt; is associated with acute symptomatic infections. Vertical transmission also occurs and is presumably important for the maintenance of DWV in honey bee populations. To further our understanding the vertical transmission of DWV through queens, we performed three experiments: we studied the quantitative effectiveness of vertical transmission, surveyed the prevalence of successful egg infection under commercial conditions, and distinguished among three possible mechanisms of transmission. We find that queen-infection level predicts the DWV titers in their eggs, although the transmission is not very efficient. Our quantitative assessment of DWV demonstrates that eggs in 1/3 of the colonies are infected with DWV and highly infected eggs are rare in newly-installed spring colonies. Additionally, our results indicate that DWV transmission occurs predominantly by virus adhering to the surface of eggs (transovum) rather than intracellularly. Our combined results suggest that the queens’ DWV vectoring capacity in practice is not as high as its theoretical potential. Thus, DWV transmission by honey bee queens is part of the DWV epidemic with relevant practical implications, which should be further studied.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Esmaeil Amiri</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195283</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde34:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>94a2f6db</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Esmaeil Amiri, Per Kryger, Marina D.

With the exploitation of offshore oil and gas gradually moving to deep water, higher temperature differences and pressure differences are applied to the pipeline system, making the global buckling of the pipeline more serious. For unburied deep-water pipelines, the lateral buckling is the major buckling form. The initial imperfections widely exist in the pipeline system due to manufacture defects or the influence of uneven seabed, and the distribution and geometry features of initial imperfections are random. They can be divided into two kinds based on shape: single-arch imperfections and double-arch imperfections. This paper analyzed the global buckling process of a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections by using a numerical simulation method and revealed how the ratio of the initial imperfection’s space length to the imperfection’s wavelength and the combination of imperfections affects the buckling process. The results show that a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections may suffer the superposition of global buckling. The growth ratios of buckling displacement, axial force and bending moment in the superposition zone are several times larger than no buckling superposition pipeline. The ratio of the initial imperfection’s space length to the imperfection’s wavelength decides whether a pipeline suffers buckling superposition. The potential failure point of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is as same as the no buckling superposition pipeline, but the failure risk of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is much higher. The shape and direction of two nearby imperfections also affects the failure risk of pipeline exhibiting global buckling superposition. The failure risk of pipeline with two double-arch imperfections is higher than pipeline with two single-arch imperfections.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Wenbin Liu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194426</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f9:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>1f530e1b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wenbin Liu, Aimin Liu&lt;/p&gt;

The failure risk of pipeline with two double-arch imperfections is higher than pipeline with two single-arch imperfections.</description><published>1521493200000</published><title>Numerical research on the lateral global buckling characteristics of a high temperature and pressure pipeline with two initial imperfections</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1290-b?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1290-b?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1290-b?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521135592000</published><author><name>Dove, A.</name></author><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d2510f:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521143966531</crawled><fingerprint>69f98005</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Technology Feature | In vitro veritas: Biosensors and micro-arrays come to life</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03669-5</originId><published>1521702000000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03669-5</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03669-5</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sewage microbes make a fuel booster&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sewage microbes make a fuel booster, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03669-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03669-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Bacterial enzyme makes the petrol-oxygenating agent toluene.</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>8</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1624ee1a75d:40a4b0f:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741834077</crawled><fingerprint>a4de7d56</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sewage microbes make a fuel booster&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sewage microbes make a fuel booster, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03669-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03669-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Bacterial enzyme makes the petrol-oxygenating agent toluene.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03669-5/d41586-018-03669-5_15548300.jpg</url></visual><title>Sewage microbes make a fuel booster</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194095</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194095</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194095</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Itismita Mohanty, Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin&lt;/p&gt;
This paper examines the effect of maternal socio-economic status in the household, such as their autonomy, ability, freedom and bargaining power, on child birth registration in India using the nationally representative India Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II), 2011–12. We have estimated a multilevel mixed effects model which accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data and allows us to examine the effects of unobserved ‘district’ and ‘community’ characteristics along with individual child level characteristics on probability of birth registration. The results show that between-districts and between individuals differences share a considerably high and an almost equal proportion of the variations in probability of birth registration in India. At individual child level, mother’s socio-economic status such as her ability to move around independently and her exposure to outside world, significantly raise the probability of birth registration. More importantly, the marginal effects of the maternal autonomy indicators: mother’s ability to move around freely and her control over resources, on birth registration vary across districts in India. Other variables such as institutional birth, mother’s antenatal care seeking behaviour, caste, religion, household wealth and parental education are significant determinants of birth registration.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Itismita Mohanty</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194095</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d57:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>711e885</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Itismita Mohanty, Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Trauma is a global burden of disease and one of the main causes of death worldwide. Therefore, many countries around the world have implemented a wide range of different initiatives to minimize mortality rates after trauma. One of these initiatives is the bundling of treatment expertise in trauma centers and the establishment of trauma networks.Germany has a decentralized system of trauma care medical centers. Severely injured patients ought to receive adequate treatment in both level I and level II centers. This study investigated the effectiveness of a decentralized network and the question whether level I and level II centers have comparable patient outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;In 2009, the first trauma network DGU&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; in Germany was certified in the rural area of Eastern Bavaria. All patients admitted to the 25 participating hospitals were prospectively included in this network in the framework of a study sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research between March 2012 and February 2014. 2 hospitals were level I centers (maximal care centers), 8 hospitals were level II centers, and 15 hospitals were level III centers. The criterion for study inclusion was an injury severity score (ISS) ≥ 16 for patients´ primarily admitted to a level I or a level II center. Exclusion criteria were transferal to another hospital within 48 h, an unknown revised injury severity classification II score (RISC II), or primary admittance to a level III center (n = 52). 875 patients were included in the study.Univariate analyses were used regarding the preclinical and clinical parameters, the primary endpoint mortality rate, and the secondary endpoints length of stay, organ failure, and neurological outcome (GOS). The primary endpoint was additionally evaluated by means of multivariable analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Indices for injury severity (GCS, AIS&lt;sub&gt;Head&lt;/sub&gt;, ISS, and NISS) as well as the predicted probability of death (RISC II) were higher in level I centers than in level II centers.No significant differences were found between the mortality rate of the unadjusted analysis [level I: 21.6% (CI: 16.5, 27.9), level II: 18.1% (CI: 14.4, 22.5), p = 0.28] and that of the adjusted analysis [level I SMR: 0.94 (CI: 0.72, 1.21), level II SMR: 1.18 (CI 0.95, 1.48) SMR: expected vs. calculated mortality rate according to RISC II]. Multivariable analysis showed a survival advantage of patients admitted to a level I center with a probability of death of 13% (RISC II). The number need to treat was 10 patients.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that a rural trauma network with centralized and local structures may achieve equivalent results with regard to mortality rates to those obtained in level I and level II centers.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the cost-effectiveness of the elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) regimen in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;This study uses a health economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating previously untreated and treatment experienced chronic hepatitis C patients who have severe and end stage renal disease with the elbasvir-grazoprevir regimen versus no treatment in the French context. The lifetime homogeneous markovian model comprises of forty combined health states including hepatitis C virus and chronic kidney disease. The model parameters were from a multicentre randomized controlled trial, ANRS CO22 HEPATHER French cohort and literature. 1000 Monte Carlo simulations of patient health states for each treatment strategy are used for probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 95% confidence intervals calculations. The results were expressed in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;The mean age of patients in the HEPATHER French cohort was 59.6 years and 56% of them were men. 22.3% of patients had a F0 fibrosis stage (no fibrosis), 24.1% a F1 stage (portal fibrosis without septa), 7.1% a F2 stage (portal fibrosis with few septa), 21.4% a F3 stage (numerous septa without fibrosis) and 25% a F4 fibrosis stage (compensated cirrhosis). Among these HCV genotype 1 patients, 30% had severe renal impairment stage 4, 33% had a severe renal insufficiency stage 5 and 37% had terminal severe renal impairment stage 5 treated by dialysis.&lt;/p&gt; Intervention &lt;p&gt;Fixed-dose combination of direct-acting antiviral agents elbasvir and grazoprevir compared to no-treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;EBR/GZR increased the number of life years (6.3 years) compared to no treatment (5.1 years) on a lifetime horizon. The total number of QALYs was higher for the new treatment because of better utility on health conditions (6.2 versus 3.7 QALYs). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was of €15,212 per QALY gained for the base case analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This cost-utility model is an innovative approach that simultaneously looks at the disease evolution of chronic hepatitis C and chronic kidney disease. EBR/GZR without interferon and ribavirin, produced the greatest benefit in terms of life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in treatment-naïve or experienced patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 and stage 4–5 chronic kidney disease including dialysis patients.

Our electronic characterization further reveals a highly anisotropic electronic structure, where orthogonal one-dimensional electronic bands with an energy gap of ~1 electron volt coexist with confined pore states, making the nanoporous graphene a highly versatile semiconductor for simultaneous sieving and electrical sensing of molecular species.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523554636000</published><title>Bottom-up synthesis of multifunctional nanoporous graphene</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24027-5</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24027-5</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/JowMEFvxGpg/s41598-018-24027-5</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Myotube elasticity of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myotube elasticity of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24027-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24027-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Myotube elasticity of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/JowMEFvxGpg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>223</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24027-5/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24027_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><author><name>Béla Varga</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24027-5</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b924a6a3:c62b96:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523524609699</crawled><fingerprint>8fb9fc6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Myotube elasticity of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myotube elasticity of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24027-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24027-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Myotube elasticity of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/JowMEFvxGpg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1523516400000</published><title>Myotube elasticity of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by ZeYu Wang, YanXia Wu, ShuHui Bu, PengCheng Han, GuoYin Zhang&lt;/p&gt;
Explicit structural inference is one key point to improve the accuracy of scene parsing. Meanwhile, adversarial training method is able to reinforce spatial contiguity in output segmentations. To take both advantages of the structural learning and adversarial training simultaneously, we propose a novel deep learning network architecture called Structural Inference Embedded Adversarial Networks (SIEANs) for pixel-wise scene labeling. The generator of our SIEANs, a novel designed scene parsing network, makes full use of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks to learn the global contextual information of objects in four different directions from RGB-(D) images, which is able to describe the (three-dimensional) spatial distributions of objects in a more comprehensive and accurate way. To further improve the performance, we explore the adversarial training method to optimize the generator along with a discriminator, which can not only detect and correct higher-order inconsistencies between the predicted segmentations and corresponding ground truths, but also exploit full advantages of the generator by fine-tuning its parameters so as to obtain higher consistencies. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SIEANs is able to achieve a better performance on PASCAL VOC 2012, SIFT FLOW, PASCAL Person-Part, Cityscapes, Stanford Background, NYUDv2, and SUN-RGBD datasets compared to the most of state-of-the-art methods.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>ZeYu Wang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7137:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>97df91ae</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by ZeYu Wang, YanXia Wu, ShuHui Bu, PengCheng Han, GuoYin Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives and methods &lt;p&gt;Using a randomized, crossover, counterbalanced approach, cyclists (N = 20, overnight fasted state) engaged in the four 75-km time trials (2-week washout) while ingesting two types of bananas with similar carbohydrate (CHO) but different phenolic content (Cavendish, CAV; mini-yellow, MIY, 63% higher polyphenols), a 6% sugar beverage (SUG), and water only (WAT). CHO intake was set at 0.2 g/kg every 15 minutes. Blood samples were collected pre-exercise and 0 h-, 0.75 h-,1.5 h-, 3 h-, 4.5 h-, 21 h-, 45 h-post-exercise.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Each of the CHO trials (CAV, MIY, SUG) compared to water was associated with higher post-exercise plasma glucose and fructose, and lower leukocyte counts, plasma 9+13 HODES, and IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra. OPLS-DA analysis showed that metabolic perturbation (N = 1,605 metabolites) for WAT (86.8±4.0 arbitrary units) was significantly greater and sustained than for CAV (70.4±3.9, P = 0.006), MIY (68.3±4.0, P = 0.002), and SUG (68.1±4.2, P = 0.002). VIP ranking (&amp;lt;3.0, N = 25 metabolites) showed that both CAV and MIY were associated with significant fold changes in metabolites including those from amino acid and xenobiotics pathways. OPLS-DA analysis of immediate post-exercise metabolite shifts showed a significant separation of CAV and MIY from both WAT and SUG (R2Y = 0.848, Q2Y = 0.409). COX-2 mRNA expression was lower in both CAV and MIY, but not SUG, versus WAT at 21-h post-exercise in THP-1 monocytes cultured in plasma samples. Analysis of immediate post-exercise samples showed a decrease in LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocyte extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in CAV and MIY, but not SUG, compared to WAT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CHO ingestion from bananas or a sugar beverage had a comparable influence in attenuating metabolic perturbation and inflammation following 75-km cycling. Ex-vivo analysis with THP-1 monocytes supported a decrease in COX-2 mRNA expression and reduced reliance on glycolysis for ATP production following ingestion of bananas but not sugar water when compared to water alone.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov, U.S. National Institutes of Health, identifier: NCT02994628&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>David C.

VIP ranking (&amp;lt;3.0, N = 25 metabolites) showed that both CAV and MIY were associated with significant fold changes in metabolites including those from amino acid and xenobiotics pathways. OPLS-DA analysis of immediate post-exercise metabolite shifts showed a significant separation of CAV and MIY from both WAT and SUG (R2Y = 0.848, Q2Y = 0.409). COX-2 mRNA expression was lower in both CAV and MIY, but not SUG, versus WAT at 21-h post-exercise in THP-1 monocytes cultured in plasma samples. Analysis of immediate post-exercise samples showed a decrease in LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocyte extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in CAV and MIY, but not SUG, compared to WAT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CHO ingestion from bananas or a sugar beverage had a comparable influence in attenuating metabolic perturbation and inflammation following 75-km cycling. Ex-vivo analysis with THP-1 monocytes supported a decrease in COX-2 mRNA expression and reduced reliance on glycolysis for ATP production following ingestion of bananas but not sugar water when compared to water alone.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov, U.S. National Institutes of Health, identifier: NCT02994628&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Metabolic recovery from heavy exertion following banana compared to sugar beverage or water only ingestion: A randomized, crossover trial</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195754</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195754</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195754</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yongsheng Zhu, Hanju Sun, Shudong He, Qiuyan Lou, Min Yu, Mingming Tang, Lijun Tu&lt;/p&gt;
Anthocyanins are naturally active substances. In this study, anthocyanins from black rice were obtained by membrane filtration and column chromatography separation. Five anthocyanin monomers in black rice extract were identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and the major anthocyanin monomer (cyanidin-3-glucoside, C3G) was purified by preparative HPLC (Pre-HPLC). The proliferative effects of the anthocyanins on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were investigated by determining the media pH, bacterial populations and metabolic products. After anaerobic incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, not only the pH of the media containing C3G was lower than that of the extract of black rice anthocyanin (BRAE), but the numbers of both Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were also significantly increased. Furthermore, hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, and hydroxybenzoic acids and other metabolites were detected by GC-MS &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our results revealed that the anthocyanins and anthocyanin monomers from black rice had prebiotic activity and they were metabolized into several small molecules by Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Yongsheng Zhu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195754</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a5:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>7673a56e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yongsheng Zhu, Hanju Sun, Shudong He, Qiuyan Lou, Min Yu, Mingming Tang, Lijun Tu&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the double burden of infectious and chronic non-communicable diseases in Africa, health care expenditure disproportionately favours infectious diseases. In this paper, we examine quantitatively the extent of this disproportionate access to diagnoses and treatment of diabetes, hypertension and malaria in Ghana. A total of 220 health facilities was surveyed across the country in 2011. Findings indicate that diagnoses and treatment of infectious diseases were more accessible than NCDs. In terms of treatment, 78% and 87% of health facilities had two of the recommended malaria drugs while less than 35% had essential diabetes and hypertension drugs. There is a significant unmet need for diagnoses and treatment of NCDs in Ghana. These inequities have implications for high morbidity and mortality from NCDs. We recommend the use of task shifting as a model to increase the delivery of NCD services.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Mawuli Komla Kushitor</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194677</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51cd:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>a3e5b8bd</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mawuli Komla Kushitor, Sandra Boatemaa&lt;/p&gt;

In health sector, trust is considered important because it indirectly influences the quality of health care through patient satisfaction, adherence and the continuity of its relationship with health care professionals and the promotion of accurate and timely diagnoses. One of the important requirements of TRSs in the health sector is rating secrecy, which mandates that the identification information about the service consumer should be kept secret to prevent any privacy violation. Anonymity and trust are two imperative objectives, and no significant explicit efforts have been made to achieve both of them at the same time. In this paper, we present a framework for solving the problem of reconciling trust with anonymity in the health sector. Our solution comprises Anonymous &lt;i&gt;Reputation Management&lt;/i&gt; (ARM) protocol and &lt;i&gt;Context-aware Trustworthiness Assessment&lt;/i&gt; (CTA) protocol. ARM protocol ensures that only those service consumers who received a service from a specific service provider provide a recommendation score anonymously with in the specified time limit. The CTA protocol computes the reputation of a user as a service provider and as a recommender. To determine the correctness of the proposed ARM protocol, formal modelling and verification are performed using High Level Petri Nets (HLPN) and Z3 Solver. Our simulation results verify the accuracy of the proposed context-aware trust assessment scheme.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Farhana Jabeen</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7132:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>4913f262</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Farhana Jabeen, Zara Hamid, Wadood Abdul, Sanaa Ghouzali, Abid Khan, Saif Ur Rehman Malik, Mansoor Shaukat Khan, Sarfraz Nawaz&lt;/p&gt;

Whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) affects mental functions, and how any such effects arise from its neural effects, continue to be debated. We investigated whether tDCS applied over the visual cortex (Oz) with a vertex (Cz) reference might affect response times (RTs) in a visual search task. We also examined whether any significant tDCS effects would interact with task factors (target presence, discrimination difficulty, and stimulus brightness) that are known to selectively influence one or the other of the two information processing stages posited by current models of visual search. Based on additive factor logic, we expected that the pattern of interactions involving a significant tDCS effect could help us colocalize the tDCS effect to one (or both) of the processing stages. In Experiment 1 (n = 12), anodal tDCS improved RTs significantly; cathodal tDCS produced a nonsignificant trend toward improvement. However, there were no interactions between the anodal tDCS effect and target presence or discrimination difficulty. In Experiment 2 (n = 18), we manipulated stimulus brightness along with target presence and discrimination difficulty. Anodal and cathodal tDCS both produced significant improvements in RTs. Again, the tDCS effects did not interact with any of the task factors. In Experiment 3 (n = 16), electrodes were placed at Cz and on the upper arm, to test for a possible effect of incidental stimulation of the motor regions under Cz. No effect of tDCS on RTs was found.

Whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) affects mental functions, and how any such effects arise from its neural effects, continue to be debated. We investigated whether tDCS applied over the visual cortex (Oz) with a vertex (Cz) reference might affect response times (RTs) in a visual search task. We also examined whether any significant tDCS effects would interact with task factors (target presence, discrimination difficulty, and stimulus brightness) that are known to selectively influence one or the other of the two information processing stages posited by current models of visual search. Based on additive factor logic, we expected that the pattern of interactions involving a significant tDCS effect could help us colocalize the tDCS effect to one (or both) of the processing stages. In Experiment 1 (n = 12), anodal tDCS improved RTs significantly; cathodal tDCS produced a nonsignificant trend toward improvement. However, there were no interactions between the anodal tDCS effect and target presence or discrimination difficulty. In Experiment 2 (n = 18), we manipulated stimulus brightness along with target presence and discrimination difficulty. Anodal and cathodal tDCS both produced significant improvements in RTs. Again, the tDCS effects did not interact with any of the task factors. In Experiment 3 (n = 16), electrodes were placed at Cz and on the upper arm, to test for a possible effect of incidental stimulation of the motor regions under Cz. No effect of tDCS on RTs was found. These findings strengthen the case for tDCS having real effects on cerebral information processing. However, these effects did not clearly arise from either of the two processing stages of the visual search process. We suggest that this is because tDCS has a DIFFUSE, pervasive action across the task-relevant neuroanatomical region(s), not a discrete effect in terms of information processing stages.</description><published>1521579600000</published><title>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) facilitates overall visual search response times but does not interact with visual search task factors</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021634?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021634?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021634?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1522736146000</published><author><name>Bijyalaxmi Athokpam</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b3f:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><fingerprint>ba1db175</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Alkyl hydrogen atom abstraction reactions of the CN radical with ethanol</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194272</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194272</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194272</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Barbara Padalino, Sharanne L.

This study aimed to document the effects of an eight hour journey on behavioural, clinical, haematological, environmental and respiratory parameters, and to identify possible associations between factors. Twelve horses underwent clinical examination, respiratory endoscopy with tracheal wash (TW) aspiration, and collection of venous and arterial blood before (BJ) and after the journey (AJ). TW were submitted for conventional quantitative bacteriological evaluation and genetic microbiome analyses. Behaviour was assessed in stables prior to transportation and throughout the journey. Transportation caused mild, but significant, effects on fluid and electrolyte balance and an acute phase response, characterized by neutrophilia, hyperfibrinogenaemia and hyperglobulinaemia. The proportion of neutrophils in TW, tracheal mucus and TW bacterial concentration was increased AJ, with preferential replication of &lt;i&gt;Pasteurellaceae&lt;/i&gt;. Horse behaviour &lt;i&gt;en route&lt;/i&gt; predicted clinical and respiratory outcomes. The frequency of stress related behaviours was greatest in the first hour of the journey, and balance-related behaviours were most common in the final hour of the journey. Horses which lowered their heads less frequently &lt;i&gt;en route&lt;/i&gt; and showed more stress-related behaviours had higher physiological stress (serum cortisol and heart rate on arrival), increased tracheal mucus and inflammation scores, and higher TW bacterial concentration AJ (P&amp;lt;0.05). Six horses with abnormal lung auscultation AJ proved to have had higher tracheal inflammation scores at preloading (P = 0.017), an overall higher concentration of bacteria in their TW (P = 0.013), and an increased percentage of neutrophils in TW at five days AJ (P = 0.003) in comparison to the other horses. While transport-related health problems are multifactorial, clinical examination, including auscultation and endoscopic inspection of the lower respiratory tract before and after journey, and behavioural observation &lt;i&gt;en route&lt;/i&gt; may identify animals at increased risk of transport associated respiratory disease.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Barbara Padalino</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194272</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123918:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>9999fc62</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Barbara Padalino, Sharanne L.

In this study, effects of continuous cropping on soil properties, enzyme activities, and relative abundance, community composition and diversity of fungal taxa were investigated. Rhizosphere soil from field continuously cropped for one-year, three-year and five-year by &lt;i&gt;Coptis chinensis&lt;/i&gt; Franch. was collected and analyzed. Illumina high-throughput sequencing analysis showed that continuous cropping of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;chinensis&lt;/i&gt; resulted in a significant and continuous decline in the richness and diversity of soil fungal population. Ascomycota, Zygomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycota were the dominant phyla of fungi detected in rhizosphere soil. Fungal genera such as &lt;i&gt;Phoma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Volutella&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pachycudonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Heterodermia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gibberella&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cladosporium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trichocladium&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Sporothri&lt;/i&gt;x, were more dominant in continuously cropped samples for three-year and five-year compared to that for one-year. By contrast, genera, such as &lt;i&gt;Zygosaccharomyces&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudotaeniolina&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hydnum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Umbelopsis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Humicola&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Crustoderma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Psilocybe&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Coralloidiomyces&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mortierella&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Polyporus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pyrenula&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Monographella&lt;/i&gt; showed higher relative abundance in one-year samples than that in three-year and five-year samples. Cluster analysis of the fungal communities from three samples of rhizosphere soil from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;chinensis&lt;/i&gt; field revealed that the fungal community composition, diversity, and structure were significantly affected by the continuous cropping. Continuous cropping of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;chinensis&lt;/i&gt; also led to significant declines in soil pH, urease, and catalase activities.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the retention and discontinuation reasons of seven biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in a real-world setting of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 1,037 treatment courses with bDMARDs from 2009 to 2016 [female, 81.8%; baseline age, 59.6 y; disease duration 7.8 y; rheumatoid factor positivity 81.5%; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), 4.4; concomitant prednisolone 43.5% and methotrexate 68.6%; Bio-naïve, 57.1%; abatacept (ABT), 21.3%; tocilizumab (TCZ), 20.7%; golimumab (GLM), 16.9%; etanercept (ETN), 13.6%; adalimumab (ADA), 11.1%; infliximab (IFX), 8.5%; certolizumab pegol (CZP), 7.9%] were included in this multi-center, retrospective study. Drug retention and discontinuation reasons at 36 months were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and adjusted by potent confounders using Cox proportional hazards modeling. As a result, 455 treatment courses (43.9%) were stopped, with 217 (20.9%) stopping due to inefficacy, 113 (10.9%) due to non-toxic reasons, 86 (8.3%) due to toxic adverse events, and 39 (3.8%) due to remission. Drug retention rates in the adjusted model were as follows: total retention (ABT, 60.7%; ADA, 32.7%; CZP, 43.3%; ETN, 51.9%; GLM, 45.4%; IFX, 31.1%; and TCZ, 59.2%; P &amp;lt; 0.001); inefficacy (ABT, 81.4%; ADA, 65.7%; CZP, 60.7%; ETN, 71.3%; GLM, 68.5%; IFX, 65.0%; and TCZ, 81.4%; P = 0.015), toxic adverse events (ABT, 89.8%; ADA, 80.5%; CZP, 83.9%; ETN, 89.2%; GLM, 85.5%; IFX, 75.6%; and TCZ, 77.2%; P = 0.50), and remission (ABT, 95.5%; ADA, 88.1%; CZP, 91.1%; ETN, 97.5%; GLM, 94.7%; IFX, 86.4%; and TCZ, 98.4%; P &amp;lt; 0.001).

Drug retention rates in the adjusted model were as follows: total retention (ABT, 60.7%; ADA, 32.7%; CZP, 43.3%; ETN, 51.9%; GLM, 45.4%; IFX, 31.1%; and TCZ, 59.2%; P &amp;lt; 0.001); inefficacy (ABT, 81.4%; ADA, 65.7%; CZP, 60.7%; ETN, 71.3%; GLM, 68.5%; IFX, 65.0%; and TCZ, 81.4%; P = 0.015), toxic adverse events (ABT, 89.8%; ADA, 80.5%; CZP, 83.9%; ETN, 89.2%; GLM, 85.5%; IFX, 75.6%; and TCZ, 77.2%; P = 0.50), and remission (ABT, 95.5%; ADA, 88.1%; CZP, 91.1%; ETN, 97.5%; GLM, 94.7%; IFX, 86.4%; and TCZ, 98.4%; P &amp;lt; 0.001). In the treatment of RA, ABT and TCZ showed higher overall retention, and TCZ showed lower inefficacy compared to IFX, while IFX showed higher discontinuation due to remission compared to ABT, ETN, GLM, and TCZ in adjusted modeling.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Drug retention and discontinuation reasons between seven biologics in patients with rheumatoid arthritis -The ANSWER cohort study-</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3563.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3563.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3563.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>In the initial steps of photosynthesis, reaction centers convert solar energy to stable charge-separated states with near-unity quantum efficiency.

Objective &lt;p&gt;With the increasing awareness of the importance of oral health, patients have an increasing need for integrated care from dentists. In China, the dentistry examination consists of two parts: a practical skills examination and a comprehensive medical examination; to date, no assessment methods that are based on specialized dentistry competencies, unlike the United States, Canada, and other countries, have been established. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to construct a competency model for dentists in China in order to guide the development, admission, training and assessment of dentists.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using a literature review, focus group interviews and in-depth personal interviews, a dentist competency index was developed with an expert consultation questionnaire. A panel of 20 specialist experts was chosen from ten national medical universities to carry out two rounds of Delphi expert analysis, using the boundary value method to filter the indicators and the Analytic Hierarchy Process to calculate the weights of the primary indicators.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Two rounds of Delphi results showed that the expert authority, enthusiasm, and coordination coefficients were high. Constructs of the competency model that included seven primary indicators and 62 secondary indicators determined the weight of each index. The seven primary indicators included the following: clinical skills and medical services, disease prevention and health promotion, interpersonal communication skills, core values and professionalism, medical knowledge and lifelong learning ability, teamwork ability and scientific research ability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the use of the Delphi method to construct an initial model of Chinese physician competency is scientific and feasible. The initial competency model conforms to the characteristics and quality requirements of dentists in China and has a strong scientific basis. The dentist competency model should be used in the National Dental Licensing Examination in China.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Yunxia Geng</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194411</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123927:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>a9767d9c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yunxia Geng, Liying Zhao, Yu Wang, Yiyuan Jiang, Kai Meng, Dongxiang Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

A panel of 20 specialist experts was chosen from ten national medical universities to carry out two rounds of Delphi expert analysis, using the boundary value method to filter the indicators and the Analytic Hierarchy Process to calculate the weights of the primary indicators.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Two rounds of Delphi results showed that the expert authority, enthusiasm, and coordination coefficients were high. Constructs of the competency model that included seven primary indicators and 62 secondary indicators determined the weight of each index. The seven primary indicators included the following: clinical skills and medical services, disease prevention and health promotion, interpersonal communication skills, core values and professionalism, medical knowledge and lifelong learning ability, teamwork ability and scientific research ability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the use of the Delphi method to construct an initial model of Chinese physician competency is scientific and feasible. The initial competency model conforms to the characteristics and quality requirements of dentists in China and has a strong scientific basis. The dentist competency model should be used in the National Dental Licensing Examination in China.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Competency model for dentists in China: Results of a Delphi study</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195159</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195159</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195159</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sávio H.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 dibetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is frequent and associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard to measure cardiac autonomic neuropathy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta–analysis to evaluate the impact of T2DM on HRV parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; October 2017 using the keywords “diabetes” AND (“heart rate variability” OR “HRV”). Included articles had to report HRV parameters in T2DM patients and healthy controls measured during 24 hours with a Holter–electrocardiogram. Measurements of HRV retieved were: RR–intervals (or Normal to Normal intervals—NN), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), percetange of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), total power, Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio, as per Task Force recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included twenty-five case-control studies with 2,932 patients: 1,356 with T2DM and 1,576 healthy controls. T2DM patients had significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) lower RR–intervals (effect size = –0.61; 95%CI –1.21 to –0.01), lower SDNN (–0.65; –0.83 to –0.47), lower RMSSD (–0.92; –1.37 to –0.47), lower pNN50 (–0.46; –0.84 to –0.09), lower total power (–1.52; –2.13 to –0.91), lower LF (–1.08; –1.46 to –0.69]), and lower HF (–0.79; –1.09 to –0.50).

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 dibetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is frequent and associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard to measure cardiac autonomic neuropathy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta–analysis to evaluate the impact of T2DM on HRV parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; October 2017 using the keywords “diabetes” AND (“heart rate variability” OR “HRV”). Included articles had to report HRV parameters in T2DM patients and healthy controls measured during 24 hours with a Holter–electrocardiogram. Measurements of HRV retieved were: RR–intervals (or Normal to Normal intervals—NN), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), percetange of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), total power, Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio, as per Task Force recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included twenty-five case-control studies with 2,932 patients: 1,356 with T2DM and 1,576 healthy controls. T2DM patients had significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) lower RR–intervals (effect size = –0.61; 95%CI –1.21 to –0.01), lower SDNN (–0.65; –0.83 to –0.47), lower RMSSD (–0.92; –1.37 to –0.47), lower pNN50 (–0.46; –0.84 to –0.09), lower total power (–1.52; –2.13 to –0.91), lower LF (–1.08; –1.46 to –0.69]), and lower HF (–0.79; –1.09 to –0.50). LF/HF did not differ between groups. Levels of blood glucose and HbA1c were associated with several HRV parameters, as well as Time from diagnosis of T2DM&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;T2DM was associated with an overall decrease in the HRV of T2DM patients. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity were decreased, which can be explained by the deleterious effects of altered glucose metabolism on HRV, leading to cardiac autonomic neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522702800000</published><title>Heart rate variability in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta–analysis</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25801</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25801</link><crawled>1520944638466</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1520899200000</published><author><name>tim@cos.io (John Repass)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/25801</canonicalUrl><engagement>2</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1621f5d6a02:3fdd7f:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/25801</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>a714593e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Cancer Biology</item></keywords><description>As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/&quot;&gt;Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology&lt;/a&gt;, we published a Registered Report (Repass et al., 2016), that described how we intended to replicate an experiment from the paper ‘&lt;i&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; infection is prevalent in human colorectal carcinoma’ (Castellarin et al., 2012).

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) that are symbiotically associated with &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria can kill target insects via direct infection and toxin action. There are limited reports identifying such organisms in the National Park of Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify EPNs and symbiotic bacteria from Nam Nao National Park, Phetchabun Province, Thailand and to evaluate the larvicidal activity of bacteria against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 12 EPN isolates belonging to &lt;i&gt;Steinernema&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heterorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; were obtained form 940 soil samples between February 2014 and July 2016. EPNs were molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;websteri&lt;/i&gt; (10 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates). Symbiotic bacteria were isolated from EPNs and molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (13 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (11 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonica&lt;/i&gt; (1 isolate). For the bioassay, bacterial suspensions were evaluated for toxicity against third to early fourth instar larvae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; spp. The larvae of both &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; species were orally susceptible to symbiotic bacteria. The highest larval mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; was 99% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (bNN112.3_TH) at 96 h, and the highest mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was 98% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (bNN121.4_TH) at 96 h. In contrast to the control groups (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and distilled water), the mortality rate of both mosquito larvae ranged between 0 and 7% at 72 h.

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) that are symbiotically associated with &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria can kill target insects via direct infection and toxin action. There are limited reports identifying such organisms in the National Park of Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify EPNs and symbiotic bacteria from Nam Nao National Park, Phetchabun Province, Thailand and to evaluate the larvicidal activity of bacteria against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 12 EPN isolates belonging to &lt;i&gt;Steinernema&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heterorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; were obtained form 940 soil samples between February 2014 and July 2016. EPNs were molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;websteri&lt;/i&gt; (10 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates). Symbiotic bacteria were isolated from EPNs and molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (13 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (11 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonica&lt;/i&gt; (1 isolate). For the bioassay, bacterial suspensions were evaluated for toxicity against third to early fourth instar larvae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; spp. The larvae of both &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; species were orally susceptible to symbiotic bacteria. The highest larval mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; was 99% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (bNN112.3_TH) at 96 h, and the highest mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was 98% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (bNN121.4_TH) at 96 h. In contrast to the control groups (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and distilled water), the mortality rate of both mosquito larvae ranged between 0 and 7% at 72 h. Here, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand. Additionally, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; associated with &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand. &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; has potential to be a biocontrol agent for mosquitoes.

Offspring survival is generally more variable than adult survival and may limit population growth. Although white-tailed deer neonate survival has been intensively investigated, recent work has emphasized how specific cover types influence neonate survival at local scales (single study area). These localized investigations have often led to inconsistences within the literature. Developing specific hypotheses describing the relationships among environmental, habitat, and landscape factors influencing white-tailed deer neonate survival at regional scales may allow for detection of generalized patterns. Therefore, we developed 11 hypotheses representing the various effects of environmental (e.g., winter and spring weather), habitat (e.g., hiding and escape cover types), and landscape factors (e.g., landscape configuration regardless of specific cover type available) on white-tailed deer neonate survival up to one-month and from one- to three-months of age. At one-month, surviving fawns experienced a warmer lowest recorded June temperature and more June precipitation than those that perished. At three-months, patch connectance (percent of patches of the corresponding patch type that are connected within a predefined distance) positively influenced survival. Our results are consistent with white-tailed deer neonate ecology: increased spring temperature and precipitation are likely associated with a flush of nutritional resources available to the mother, promoting increased lactation efficiency and neonate growth early in life. In contrast, reduced spring temperature with increased precipitation place neonates at risk to hypothermia. Increased patch connectance likely reflects increased escape cover available within a neonate’s home range after they are able to flee from predators. If suitable escape cover is available on the landscape, then managers could focus efforts towards manipulating landscape configuration (patch connectance) to promote increased neonate survival while monitoring spring weather to assess potential influences on current year survival.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Eric S.

The development of models of macromolecular electrostatics capable of delivering improved fidelity to quantum mechanical calculations is an active field of research in computational chemistry. Most molecular force field development takes place in the context of models with full Cartesian coordinate degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, a number of macromolecular modeling programs use a reduced set of conformational variables limited to rotatable bonds. Efficient algorithms for minimizing the energies of macromolecular systems with torsional degrees of freedom have been developed with the assumption that all atom-atom interaction potentials are isotropic. We describe novel modifications to address the anisotropy of higher order multipole terms while retaining the efficiency of these approaches. In addition, we present a treatment for obtaining derivatives of atom-centered tensors with respect to torsional degrees of freedom. We apply these results to enable minimization of the Amoeba multipole electrostatics potential in a system with torsional degrees of freedom, and validate the correctness of the gradients by comparison to finite difference approximations. In the interest of enabling a complete model of electrostatics with implicit treatment of solvent-mediated effects, we also derive expressions for the derivative of solvent accessible surface area with respect to torsional degrees of freedom.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Nicholas K.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely performed to identify brain lesions in boys with central precocious puberty (CPP). We investigated the prevalence of CPP in Korean boys and the necessity for routine brain MRI examinations. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2003 to December 2016 at a Korean university hospital. Among 151 boys who were diagnosed with CPP, the data of 138 boys who underwent sellar MRI were evaluated. The mean age of the study subjects was 9.51 ± 0.56 years (&amp;lt;8 years [n = 4] and ≥8 years [n = 134]). We excluded patients who had been previously diagnosed with brain tumors and those who did not undergo a sellar MRI because of refusal or the decision of the pediatric endocrinologist. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of intracranial lesions among boys with CPP. Normal sellar MRI findings were observed in 128 of the 138 boys (93%). Mild brain abnormalities were found in 10 boys (7%), while none of the patients had pathological brain lesions. The prevalence (7%) of intracranial lesions among boys who were healthy, did not have neurological symptoms, and were diagnosed with CPP was different from that previously reported. None of the identified lesions necessitated treatment. Although this was a single country study, we found that the previously reported prevalence of brain lesions in boys with CPP is much higher than the prevalence observed in Korea. This study suggests the need to globally reevaluate the prevalence of pathological brain lesions among male pediatric patients with CPP.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Jong Seo Yoon</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195209</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5b:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>8f45462f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jong Seo Yoon, Cheol Hwan So, Hae Sang Lee, Jung Sub Lim, Jin Soon Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

This study suggests the need to globally reevaluate the prevalence of pathological brain lesions among male pediatric patients with CPP.</description><published>1522789200000</published><title>The prevalence of brain abnormalities in boys with central precocious puberty may be overestimated</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023645?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023645?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023645?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/10&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 10&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1520827108000</published><author><name>Sebastian Trippel</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1622364c343:d036c:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521012228931</crawled><fingerprint>4fd8b2ae</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Communication: Strong laser alignment of solvent-solute aggregates in the           gas-phase</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3828.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3828.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3828.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Lysyl oxidases (LOXs), a type of copper- and lysyl tyrosylquinone (LTQ) -dependent amine oxidase, catalyze the oxidative deamination of lysine residues of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as elastins and collagens and generate aldehyde groups.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV is vulnerable to unplanned treatment interruptions–consecutively missed doses over a series of days–which can result in virologic rebound. Yet clinicians lack a simple, valid method for estimating the risk of interruptions. If the likelihood of ART interruption could be derived from a convenient-to-gather summary measure of medication adherence, it might be a valuable tool for both clinical decision-making and research. We constructed an &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; probability model of ART interruption based on average adherence and tested its predictions using data collected on 185 HIV-infected, treatment-naïve individuals over the first 90 days of ART in a prospective cohort study in Mbarara, Uganda. The outcome of interest was the presence or absence of a treatment gap, defined as &gt;72 hours without a dose. Using the pre-determined value of 0.50 probability as the cut point for predicting an interruption, the classification accuracy of the model was 73% (95% CI = 66%– 79%), the specificity was 87% (95% CI = 79%– 93%), and the sensitivity was 59% (95% CI = 48%– 69%). Overall model performance was satisfactory, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.80–0.91) and Brier score of 0.20. The study serves as proof-of-concept that the probability model can accurately differentiate patients on the continuum of risk for short-term ART interruptions using a summary measure of adherence. The model may also aid in the design of targeted interventions.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Rebecca Arden Harris</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194713</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34ab:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>fbd3cb51</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca Arden Harris, Jessica E.

Fossils entombed in amber are a unique resource for reconstructing forest ecosystems, and resolving relationships of modern taxa. Such fossils are famous for their perfect, life-like appearance. However, preservation quality is vast with many sites showing only cuticular preservation, or no fossils. The taphonomic processes that control this range are largely unknown; as such, we know little about potential bias in this important record. Here we employ actualistic experiments, using, fruit flies and modern tree resin to determine whether resin type, gut microbiota, and dehydration prior to entombment affects decay. We used solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) to confirm distinct tree resin chemistry; gut microbiota of flies was modified using antibiotics and categorized though sequencing. Decay was assessed using phase contrast synchrotron tomography. Resin type demonstrates a significant control on decay rate. The composition of the gut microbiota was also influential, with minor changes in composition affecting decay rate. Dehydration prior to entombment, contrary to expectations, enhanced decay.

An epidemiological model is presented that provides a comprehensive description of the transmission pathways involved for recurrent tuberculosis (TB), whereby cured individuals can become reinfected. Our main goal is to determine conditions that lead to the appearance of a backward bifurcation. This occurs when an asymptotically stable infection free equilibrium concurrently exists with a stable non-trivial equilibria even though the basic reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is less than unity. Although, some 10-30% cases of TB are recurrent, the role of recurrent TB as far as the formation of backward bifurcation is concerned, is rarely if ever studied. The model used here incorporates progressive primary infection, exogenous reinfection, endogenous reactivation and recurrent TB as transmission mechanisms that contribute to TB progression.

An epidemiological model is presented that provides a comprehensive description of the transmission pathways involved for recurrent tuberculosis (TB), whereby cured individuals can become reinfected. Our main goal is to determine conditions that lead to the appearance of a backward bifurcation. This occurs when an asymptotically stable infection free equilibrium concurrently exists with a stable non-trivial equilibria even though the basic reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is less than unity. Although, some 10-30% cases of TB are recurrent, the role of recurrent TB as far as the formation of backward bifurcation is concerned, is rarely if ever studied. The model used here incorporates progressive primary infection, exogenous reinfection, endogenous reactivation and recurrent TB as transmission mechanisms that contribute to TB progression. Unlike other studies of TB dynamics that make use of frequency dependent transmission rates, our analysis provides exact backward bifurcation threshold conditions without resorting to commonly applied approximations and simplifying assumptions. Exploration of the model through analytical and numerical analysis reveal that recurrent TB is sometimes capable of triggering hysteresis effects which allow TB to persist when &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 1 even though there is no backward bifurcation. Furthermore, recurrent TB can independently induce backward bifurcation phenomena if it exceeds a certain threshold.</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Backward bifurcation and hysteresis in models of recurrent tuberculosis</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04169-2</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04169-2</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04169-2</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t dismiss citations to journals not published in English &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t dismiss citations to journals not published in English , Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04169-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04169-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Don’t dismiss citations to journals not published in English</content></content><published>1523430000000</published><author><name>Vladimir S.

How do we rapidly process incoming streams of information in working memory, a cognitive mechanism central to human behavior? Dominant views of working memory focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but human hippocampal recordings provide a neurophysiological signature distinct from the PFC. Are these regions independent, or do they interact in the service of working memory? We addressed this core issue in behavior by recording directly from frontotemporal sites in humans performing a visuospatial working memory task that operationalizes the types of identity and spatiotemporal information we encounter every day. Theta band oscillations drove bidirectional interactions between the PFC and medial temporal lobe (MTL; including the hippocampus). MTL theta oscillations directed the PFC preferentially during the processing of spatiotemporal information, while PFC theta oscillations directed the MTL for all types of information being processed in working memory. These findings reveal an MTL theta mechanism for processing space and time and a domain-general PFC theta mechanism, providing evidence that rapid, dynamic MTL–PFC interactions underlie working memory for everyday experiences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5Z-HrtFgn-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004274</href></item></canonical><engagement>7</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004274</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16277feec6e:11ab9b:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522431618158</crawled><fingerprint>5d873c0a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth L.

The path choice behavior of battery electric vehicle (BEV) drivers is influenced by the lack of public charging stations, limited battery capacity, range anxiety and long battery charging time. This paper investigates the congestion/flow pattern captured by stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) traffic assignment problem in transportation networks with BEVs, where the BEV paths are restricted by their battery capacities. The BEV energy consumption is assumed to be a linear function of path length and path travel time, which addresses both path distance limit problem and road congestion effect. A mathematical programming model is proposed for the path-based SUE traffic assignment where the path cost is the sum of the corresponding link costs and a path specific out-of-energy penalty. We then apply the convergent Lagrangian dual method to transform the original problem into a concave maximization problem and develop a customized gradient projection algorithm to solve it. A column generation procedure is incorporated to generate the path set. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and the solution algorithm.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Wentao Jing</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194354</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e18:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>de4e082b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wentao Jing, Mohsen Ramezani, Kun An, Inhi Kim&lt;/p&gt;

The relationships of the monogeneric family Plastoceridae Crowson, 1972 (Coleoptera: Elateroidea) have remained contentious due to its modified morphology, incorrect information on incomplete metamorphosis of females and the absence of molecular data. We produced the sequences for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;angulosus&lt;/i&gt; (Germar, 1844) (the type-species of &lt;i&gt;Plastocerus&lt;/i&gt; Schaum, 1852) and performed molecular phylogenetic analyses to estimate its position. The analyses of Elateroidea (186 spp.) and Elateridae (110 spp.) molecular datasets of two mitochondrial and two nuclear gene fragments repeatedly placed &lt;i&gt;Plastocerus&lt;/i&gt; Schaum, 1852 in relationships with the elaterid genera &lt;i&gt;Oxynopterus&lt;/i&gt; Hope, 1842 and &lt;i&gt;Pectocera&lt;/i&gt; Hope, 1842. Alternative topologies were rejected by likelihood tests. Therefore, Plastoceridae Crowson, 1972 are down-ranked to the subfamily Plastocerinae in Elateridae Leach, 1815. We suggest that the morphology-based placement and high rank for some elateroid lineages were inferred from the presence of homoplasies which evolved due to incomplete sclerotization. Distantly related soft-bodied elateroids share freely movable and transverse coxae, a shortened prosternum, and a weakly sclerotized abdomen with free ventrites. Importantly, the apomorphic structures characteristic for their closest relatives, such as the prosternal process, mesoventral cavity, and intercoxal keel in the first abdominal ventrite are regularly absent. Consequently, morphology-based phylogenetic analyses suggest deeply rooted positions for lineages without expressed apomorphic character states. Molecular data represent an independent character system that is not affected by the convergent morphological evolution, and therefore molecular phylogenies can elucidate the relationships of incompletely sclerotized lineages.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Ladislav Bocak</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194026</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9fe:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>d0af45d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ladislav Bocak, Michal Motyka, Matej Bocek, Milada Bocakova&lt;/p&gt;

Spatial heterogeneity in the strength or agents of selection can lead to geographic variation in ecologically important phenotypes. Many dendrobatid frogs sequester alkaloid toxins from their diets and often exhibit fixed mutations at Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, a voltage-gated sodium ion channel associated with alkaloid toxin resistance. Yet previous studies have noted an absence of resistance mutations in individuals from several species known to sequester alkaloid toxins, suggesting possible intraspecific variation for alkaloid resistance in these species. Toxicity and alkaloid profiles vary substantially between populations in several poison frog species (genus &lt;i&gt;Dendrobates&lt;/i&gt;) and are correlated with variation in a suite of related traits such as aposematic coloration. If resistance mutations are costly, due to alterations of channel gating properties, we expect that low toxicity populations will have reduced frequencies and potentially even the loss of resistance alleles. Here, we examine whether intraspecific variation in toxicity in three dendrobatid frogs is associated with intraspecific variation in alleles conferring toxin resistance. Specifically, we examine two species that display marked variation in toxicity throughout their native ranges (&lt;i&gt;Dendrobates pumilio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granuliferus&lt;/i&gt;) and one species with reduced toxicity in its introduced range (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auratus&lt;/i&gt;). However, we find no evidence for population-level variation in alkaloid resistance at Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4. In fact, contrary to previous studies, we found that alkaloid resistance alleles were not absent in any populations of these species. All three species exhibit fixed alkaloid resistance mutations throughout their ranges, suggesting that these mutations are maintained even when alkaloid sequestration is substantially reduced.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Michael L.

Many dendrobatid frogs sequester alkaloid toxins from their diets and often exhibit fixed mutations at Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, a voltage-gated sodium ion channel associated with alkaloid toxin resistance. Yet previous studies have noted an absence of resistance mutations in individuals from several species known to sequester alkaloid toxins, suggesting possible intraspecific variation for alkaloid resistance in these species. Toxicity and alkaloid profiles vary substantially between populations in several poison frog species (genus &lt;i&gt;Dendrobates&lt;/i&gt;) and are correlated with variation in a suite of related traits such as aposematic coloration. If resistance mutations are costly, due to alterations of channel gating properties, we expect that low toxicity populations will have reduced frequencies and potentially even the loss of resistance alleles. Here, we examine whether intraspecific variation in toxicity in three dendrobatid frogs is associated with intraspecific variation in alleles conferring toxin resistance. Specifically, we examine two species that display marked variation in toxicity throughout their native ranges (&lt;i&gt;Dendrobates pumilio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granuliferus&lt;/i&gt;) and one species with reduced toxicity in its introduced range (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auratus&lt;/i&gt;). However, we find no evidence for population-level variation in alkaloid resistance at Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4. In fact, contrary to previous studies, we found that alkaloid resistance alleles were not absent in any populations of these species. All three species exhibit fixed alkaloid resistance mutations throughout their ranges, suggesting that these mutations are maintained even when alkaloid sequestration is substantially reduced.</description><published>1520974800000</published><title>Sodium ion channel alkaloid resistance does not vary with toxicity in aposematic &amp;lt;i&gt;Dendrobates&amp;lt;/i&gt; poison frogs: An examination of correlated trait evolution</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24094-8</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24094-8</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/NZGlsDjdoQo/s41598-018-24094-8</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Contributions of cuticle permeability and enzyme detoxification to pyrethroid resistance in the major malaria vector &lt;i&gt;Anopheles gambiae&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Contributions of cuticle permeability and enzyme detoxification to pyrethroid resistance in the major malaria vector &amp;lt;i&gt;Anopheles gambiae&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24094-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24094-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Contributions of cuticle permeability and enzyme detoxification to pyrethroid resistance in the major malaria vector &lt;i&gt;Anopheles gambiae&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/NZGlsDjdoQo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Gildas A.

A suitable irrigation method adopted to arid desert conditions, including a special soil structure and specialized plants, has been continuously studied and improved. A field study was conducted in the Awei irrigation area of Aletai in Xinjiang in 2015 and 2016 to investigate the applicability of shallow subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI) in an arid desert area. A completely randomized block design with three replications and three treatments for drip tape subsurface depths at 5, 10, 20 cm was established. The results indicated that the vertical distribution of the soil moisture of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI, buried depth at 20 cm) was mainly concentrated at 0–60 cm, while SSDI (buried depth at 5 and 10 cm) was concentrated at 0–30 cm. However, the roots distributions were concentrated at 0–30 cm for SDI and SSDI. The chlorophyll content and water consumption intensity for alfalfa first increased and then decreased in arid desert conditions. The dry yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of SSDI (buried depth at 10 cm) were higher than those of SDI.

In this study, we used nine superconducting qubits to demonstrate a promising path toward quantum supremacy. By individually tuning the qubit parameters, we were able to generate thousands of distinct Hamiltonian evolutions and probe the output probabilities. The measured probabilities obey a universal distribution, consistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert space. As the number of qubits increases, the system continues to explore the exponentially growing number of states. Extending these results to a system of 50 qubits has the potential to address scientific questions that are beyond the capabilities of any classical computer.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Neill, C., Roushan, P., Kechedzhi, K., Boixo, S., Isakov, S.

In this study, we used nine superconducting qubits to demonstrate a promising path toward quantum supremacy. By individually tuning the qubit parameters, we were able to generate thousands of distinct Hamiltonian evolutions and probe the output probabilities. The measured probabilities obey a universal distribution, consistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert space. As the number of qubits increases, the system continues to explore the exponentially growing number of states. Extending these results to a system of 50 qubits has the potential to address scientific questions that are beyond the capabilities of any classical computer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523554636000</published><title>A blueprint for demonstrating quantum supremacy with superconducting qubits</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34518</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34518</link><crawled>1521551971142</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521504000000</published><author><name>olivier.marre@gmail.com (Baptiste Lefebvre)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34518</canonicalUrl><engagement>2</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16243909346:2ef0cd3:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34518</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>20a73759</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><description>In recent years, multielectrode arrays and large silicon probes have been developed to record simultaneously between hundreds and thousands of electrodes packed with a high density.

The relapse of nasal deformity is a challenge for modern correction of cleft lip. A comprehensive understanding in the biomechanical perspective of both the formation and correction of the cleft lip nasal deformity would lead to improved stability of the corrective outcome. In this study, a finite element model of secondary cleft lip nasal deformity was constructed, on which two critical corrective maneuvers were mimicked in the form of force-loading. The intercrural suture was simulated by a force loaded at the intermediate crus of the alar cartilage directing anteriorly and medially, and the suture suspending the alar cartilage to the upper lateral cartilage was simulated by a force loaded at the lateral crus directing superiorly and medially. The equivalent von-mises stress and the total deformation consequent to different patterns of loading were captured. Our biomechanical analyses suggested that the intercrural suture at the nasal tip might be more effective in generating widespread morphological change than the suspension suture, but left much higher level of stress within the skin envelope if placed too high. Synergistic effect was observed between the two sutures in both the resultant deformation and stress. In addition, our simulations were partially supported by clinical photogrammetry data.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Hanyao Huang</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793628:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>940c8d61</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanyao Huang, Yeping Li, Xiangyou Luo, Xu Cheng, Bing Shi, Jingtao Li&lt;/p&gt;

Protein trafficking within cilia is mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery composed of large protein complexes. The BBSome consists of eight BBS proteins encoded by causative genes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and has been implicated in the trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), by connecting the IFT machinery to cargo GPCRs. Membrane recruitment of the BBSome to promote cargo trafficking has been proposed to be regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase ARL6/BBS3, through its interaction with the BBS1 subunit of the BBSome. We here investigated how the BBSome core subcomplex composed of BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 assembles and interacts with ARL6, and found that the ARL6–BBS1 interaction is reinforced by BBS9. &lt;i&gt;BBS1&lt;/i&gt;-knockout (KO) cells showed defects in the ciliary entry of other BBSome subunits and ARL6, and in ciliary retrograde trafficking and the export of the GPCRs, Smoothened and GPR161. The trafficking defect of these GPCRs was rescued by the exogenous expression of wild-type BBS1, but not by its mutant lacking BBS9-binding ability. Our data thus indicate that the intact BBSome is required for retrograde trafficking of GPCRs out of cilia.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Shohei Nozaki</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195005</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4252:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>761ea815</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shohei Nozaki, Yohei Katoh, Takuya Kobayashi, Kazuhisa Nakayama&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;This study explored spatial-temporal variation in diagnoses of gonorrhoea to identify and quantify endemic areas and clusters in relation to patient characteristics and outcomes of partner notification (PN) across England, UK.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Endemic areas and clusters were identified using a two-stage analysis with Kulldorff’s scan statistics (SaTScan).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2,571,838 tests, 53,547 diagnoses were gonorrhoea positive (positivity = 2.08%). The proportion of diagnoses in heterosexual males was 1.5 times that in heterosexual females. Among index cases, men who have sex with men (MSM) were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with gonorrhoea than heterosexual males (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity and deprivation rank, 4 endemic areas were identified including 11,047 diagnoses, 86% of which occurred in London. 33 clusters included 17,629 diagnoses (34% of total diagnoses in 2012 and 2013) and spanned 21 locations, some of which were dominated by heterosexually acquired infection, whilst others were MSM focused. Of the 53,547 diagnoses, 14.5% (7,775) were the result of PN. The proportion of patients who attended services as a result of PN varied from 0% to 61% within different age, gender and sexual orientation cohorts. A third of tests resulting from PN were positive for gonorrhoea. 25% of Local Authorities (n = 81, 95% CI: 20.2, 29.5) had a higher than expected proportion for female PN diagnoses as compared to 16% for males (n = 52, 95% CI: 12.0, 19.9).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The English gonorrhoea epidemic is characterised by spatial-temporal variation. PN success varied between endemic areas and clusters. Greater emphasis should be placed on the role of PN in the control of gonorrhoea to reduce the risk of onward transmission, re-infection, and complications of infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Allen O’Brien</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195178</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76927:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>86d9427a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allen O’Brien, Ellie Sherrard-Smith, Bersabeh Sile, Charlotte Watts, Ian Simms&lt;/p&gt;

After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity and deprivation rank, 4 endemic areas were identified including 11,047 diagnoses, 86% of which occurred in London. 33 clusters included 17,629 diagnoses (34% of total diagnoses in 2012 and 2013) and spanned 21 locations, some of which were dominated by heterosexually acquired infection, whilst others were MSM focused. Of the 53,547 diagnoses, 14.5% (7,775) were the result of PN. The proportion of patients who attended services as a result of PN varied from 0% to 61% within different age, gender and sexual orientation cohorts. A third of tests resulting from PN were positive for gonorrhoea. 25% of Local Authorities (n = 81, 95% CI: 20.2, 29.5) had a higher than expected proportion for female PN diagnoses as compared to 16% for males (n = 52, 95% CI: 12.0, 19.9).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The English gonorrhoea epidemic is characterised by spatial-temporal variation. PN success varied between endemic areas and clusters. Greater emphasis should be placed on the role of PN in the control of gonorrhoea to reduce the risk of onward transmission, re-infection, and complications of infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522702800000</published><title>Spatial clusters of gonorrhoea in England with particular reference to the outcome of partner notification: 2012 and 2013</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00475</originId><visual><width>560</width><contentType>image/png; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>283</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/templates/jsp/_style2/_achs/images/CoverImages_2by1Scaled/jmcmar.png</url></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00475</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/mBvpu-ZtcUs/acs.jmedchem.8b00475</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522987200000</published><author><name>Christopher J.

Numerous peripheral tissues possess self-sustaining daily biologic rhythms that are regulated at the molecular level by clock genes such as &lt;i&gt;PER1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PER2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLOCK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and BMAL1&lt;/i&gt;. Physiological function of nasal mucosa exhibits rhythmic variability to a day-night environmental cycle.

In human and rat nasal mucosa, the levels of these genes are asymmetrically expressed in nasal mucosa derived from right and left cavities in normal controls, allergic patients, and rat. In human nasal mucosa, the expression levels of these genes were higher in the decongested side than the congested mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, these clock genes are expressed in a rhythmic circadian manner under the regular light/dark cycles. The expression levels of MUC5AC, a key mucin genes produced in superficial epithelium, are higher in decongested side than that congested side in human nasal mucosa.

Metrics to quantify child growth vary across studies of the developmental origins of health and disease. We conducted a scoping review of child growth studies in which length/height, weight or body mass index (BMI) was measured at ≥ 2 time points. From a 10% random sample of eligible studies published between Jan 2010-Jun 2016, and all eligible studies from Oct 2015-June 2016, we classified growth metrics based on author-assigned labels (e.g., ‘weight gain’) and a ‘content signature’, a numeric code that summarized the metric’s conceptual and statistical properties. Heterogeneity was assessed by the number of unique content signatures, and label-to-content concordance. In 122 studies, we found 40 unique metrics of childhood growth. The most common approach to quantifying growth in length, weight or BMI was the calculation of each child’s change in z-score. Label-to-content discordance was common due to distinct content signatures carrying the same label, and because of instances in which the same content signature was assigned multiple different labels. In conclusion, the numerous distinct growth metrics and the lack of specificity in the application of metric labels challenge the integration of data and inferences from studies investigating the determinants or consequences of variations in childhood growth.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Michael Leung</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194565</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37b3:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>34cbd772</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Leung, Nandita Perumal, Elnathan Mesfin, Aditi Krishna, Seungmi Yang, William Johnson, Diego G.

The modulatory role of the primary motor cortex (M1), reflected by an inhibitory effect of M1-stimulation on clinical pain, motivated us to deepen our understanding of M1’s role in pain modulation. We used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)-induced virtual lesion (VL) to interrupt with M1 activity during noxious heat pain. We hypothesized that TMS-VL will effect experimental pain ratings. Three VL protocols were applied consisting of single-pulse TMS to transiently interfere with right M1 activity: (1) VL&lt;sub&gt;M1&lt;/sub&gt;- TMS applied to 11 subjects, 20 msec before the individual’s first pain-related M1 peak activation, as determined by source analysis (sLORETA), (2) VL&lt;sub&gt;-50&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 50 ms prior to noxious stimulus onset), and (3) VL&lt;sub&gt;+150&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 150 ms after noxious stimulus onset). Each protocol included 3 conditions (&apos;pain-alone&apos;, &apos; TMS-VL&apos;, and ‘SHAM-VL’), each consisted of 30 noxious heat stimuli. Pain ratings were compared, in each protocol, for TMS-VL vs. SHAM-VL and vs. pain-alone conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance, corrected for multiple comparisons revealed no significant differences in the pain ratings between the different conditions within each protocol. Therefore, our results from this exploratory study suggest that a single pulse TMS-induced VL that is targeted to M1 failed to interrupt experimental pain processing in the specific three stimulation timing examined here.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Lee-Bareket Kisler</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a1:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>228e14c4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lee-Bareket Kisler, Ilan Gurion, Yelena Granovsky, Alon Sinai, Elliot Sprecher, Simone Shamay-Tsoory, Irit Weissman-Fogel&lt;/p&gt;

Three VL protocols were applied consisting of single-pulse TMS to transiently interfere with right M1 activity: (1) VL&lt;sub&gt;M1&lt;/sub&gt;- TMS applied to 11 subjects, 20 msec before the individual’s first pain-related M1 peak activation, as determined by source analysis (sLORETA), (2) VL&lt;sub&gt;-50&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 50 ms prior to noxious stimulus onset), and (3) VL&lt;sub&gt;+150&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 150 ms after noxious stimulus onset). Each protocol included 3 conditions (&apos;pain-alone&apos;, &apos; TMS-VL&apos;, and ‘SHAM-VL’), each consisted of 30 noxious heat stimuli. Pain ratings were compared, in each protocol, for TMS-VL vs. SHAM-VL and vs. pain-alone conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance, corrected for multiple comparisons revealed no significant differences in the pain ratings between the different conditions within each protocol. Therefore, our results from this exploratory study suggest that a single pulse TMS-induced VL that is targeted to M1 failed to interrupt experimental pain processing in the specific three stimulation timing examined here.</description><published>1523307600000</published><title>Can a single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation targeted to the motor cortex interrupt pain processing?</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31134</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31134</link><crawled>1521045930551</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1520985600000</published><author><name>vishwa.goudar@gmail.com (Dean V Buonomano)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31134</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16225670237:463525:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31134</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>d38d9a6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><description>Much of the information the brain processes and stores is temporal in nature—a spoken word or a handwritten signature, for example, is defined by how it unfolds in time.

Based on extensive Langevin Dynamics simulations we investigate the structural properties of a two-dimensional ensemble of magnetic rods with a peapod-like morphology, i.e, rods consisting of aligned single dipolar beads. Self-assembled configurations are studied for different directions of the dipole with respect to the rod axis. We found that with increasing misalignment of the dipole from the rod axis, the smaller the packing fraction at which the percolation transition is found. For the same density, the system exhibits different aggregation states for different misalignment. We also study the stability of the percolated structures with respect to temperature, which is found to be affected by the microstructure of the assembly of rods.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Jorge L.

We report experimental and numerical results on pattern formation of self-organizing &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium discoideum&lt;/i&gt; cells in a microfluidic setup under a constant buffer flow. The external flow advects the signaling molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) downstream, while the chemotactic cells attached to the solid substrate are not transported with the flow. At high flow velocities, elongated cAMP waves are formed that cover the whole length of the channel and propagate both parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction. While the wave period and transverse propagation velocity are constant, parallel wave velocity and the wave width increase linearly with the imposed flow. We also observe that the acquired wave shape is highly dependent on the wave generation site and the strength of the imposed flow. We compared the wave shape and velocity with numerical simulations performed using a reaction-diffusion model and found excellent agreement. These results are expected to play an important role in understanding the process of pattern formation and aggregation of &lt;i&gt;D. discoideum&lt;/i&gt; that may experience fluid flows in its natural habitat.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Torsten Eckstein</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194859</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4242:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>78135b38</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Torsten Eckstein, Estefania Vidal-Henriquez, Albert Bae, Vladimir Zykov, Eberhard Bodenschatz, Azam Gholami&lt;/p&gt;

These results are expected to play an important role in understanding the process of pattern formation and aggregation of &lt;i&gt;D. discoideum&lt;/i&gt; that may experience fluid flows in its natural habitat.</description><published>1522270800000</published><title>Influence of fast advective flows on pattern formation of &amp;lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium discoideum&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194910</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194910</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194910</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Steven W.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved therapy for treatment of epilepsy and depression. While also shown to be promising in several preclinical and clinical studies to treat cardiovascular diseases, optimal therapeutic stimulation paradigms are still under investigation. Traditionally, parameters such as frequency, current, and duty cycle are used to adjust the efficacy of VNS therapy. This study explored the effect of novel stochastic VNS (S-VNS) on acute heart rate (HR) dynamics. The effect of S-VNS was evaluated in Sprague Dawley rats by comparing the acute HR and HR variability (HRV) responses to standard, periodic VNS (P-VNS) across different frequencies (FREQs, 10–30 Hz). Our results demonstrate that both S-VNS and P-VNS produced negative chronotropic effects in a FREQ-dependent manner with S-VNS inducing a significantly smaller drop in HR at 10 Hz and 20 Hz compared to P-VNS (p&amp;lt;0.05). S-VNS demonstrated a FREQ-dependent drop in the SD1/SD2 ratio, a measure of HRV, which was absent in P-VNS, suggesting that S-VNS may acutely modulate the nonlinear relationship between short- and long-term HRV. In conclusion, S-VNS is a novel stimulation procedure that may provide different physiological outcomes from standard P-VNS, as indicated by our analysis of HR dynamics. Our study provides a rationale for further detailed investigations into the therapeutic potential of S-VNS as a novel neuromodulation technique.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Steven W.

The well-characterized resting state of the cofactor does not bind substrate, so its mode of action remains enigmatic. Carbon monoxide was recently found to replace a bridging sulfide, but the mechanistic relevance was unclear. Here we report the structural analysis of vanadium nitrogenase with a bound intermediate, interpreted as a μ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-bridging, protonated nitrogen that implies the site and mode of substrate binding to the cofactor. Binding results in a flip of amino acid glutamine 176, which hydrogen-bonds the ligand and creates a holding position for the displaced sulfide.

The well-characterized resting state of the cofactor does not bind substrate, so its mode of action remains enigmatic. Carbon monoxide was recently found to replace a bridging sulfide, but the mechanistic relevance was unclear. Here we report the structural analysis of vanadium nitrogenase with a bound intermediate, interpreted as a μ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-bridging, protonated nitrogen that implies the site and mode of substrate binding to the cofactor. Binding results in a flip of amino acid glutamine 176, which hydrogen-bonds the ligand and creates a holding position for the displaced sulfide. The intermediate likely represents state E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; of the Thorneley-Lowe model and provides clues to the remainder of the catalytic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522345097000</published><title>A bound reaction intermediate sheds light on the mechanism of nitrogenase</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01751</originId><author><name>Richard S.

The importance of patch quality for amphibians is frequently overlooked in distribution models. Here we demonstrate that it is highly important for the persistence of endemic and endangered amphibians found in the threatened and fragile ecosystems that are the rocky plateaus in Western Maharashtra, India. These plateaus are ferricretes of laterite and characterise the northern section of the Western Ghats/Sri Lanka Biodiversity Hotspot, the eighth most important global hotspot and one of the three most threatened by population growth. We present statistically supported habitat associations for endangered and data-deficient Indian amphibians, demonstrating significant relationships between individual species and their microhabitats. Data were collected during early monsoon across two seasons. Twenty-one amphibian taxa were identified from 14 lateritic plateaus between 67 and 1179m above sea level. Twelve of the study taxa had significant associations with microhabitats using a stepwise analysis of the AICc subroutine (distLM, Primer-e, v7). Generalist taxa were associated with increased numbers of microhabitat types. Non-significant associations are reported for the remaining 9 taxa. Microhabitat distribution was spatially structured and driven by climate and human activity. Woody plants were associated with 44% of high-elevation taxa. Of the 8 low-elevation taxa 63% related to water bodies and 60% of those were associated with pools. Rock size and abundance were important for 33% of high elevation specialists. Three of the 4 caecilians were associated with rocks in addition to soil and stream presence. We conclude the plateaus are individualistic patches whose habitat quality is defined by their microhabitats within climatic zones.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Christopher J.

Background &lt;p&gt;While links between disability and poverty are well established, there have been few longitudinal studies to clarify direction of causality, particularly among older adults in low and middle income countries. We aimed to study the effect of care dependence among older adult residents on the economic functioning of their households, in catchment area survey sites in Peru, Mexico and China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Households were classified from the evolution of the needs for care of older residents, over two previous community surveys, as ‘incident care’, ‘chronic care’ or ‘no care’, and followed up three years later to ascertain economic outcomes (household income, consumption, economic strain, satisfaction with economic circumstances, healthcare expenditure and residents giving up work or education to care).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Household income did not differ between household groups. However, income from paid work (Pooled Count Ratio pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–1.00) and government transfers (pCR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69–0.93) were lower in care households. Consumption was 12% lower in chronic care households (pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99). Household healthcare expenditure was higher (pCR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26–1.90), and catastrophic healthcare spending more common (pRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.64–2.22) in care households.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While endogeneity cannot be confidently excluded as an explanation for the findings, this study indicates that older people’s needs for care have a discernable impact on household economics, controlling for baseline indicators of long-term economic status. Although living, typically, in multigenerational family units, older people have not featured prominently in global health and development agendas. Population ageing will rapidly increase the number of households where older people live, and their societal significance. Building sustainable long-term care systems for the future will require some combination of improved income security in old age; incentivisation of informal care through compensation for direct and opportunity costs; and development of community care services to support, and, where necessary, supplement or substitute the central role of informal caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Maëlenn M.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Using our previously developed and tested Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Stigma Scale, we investigated factors associated with perceived SRH stigma among adolescent girls in Ghana.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We drew upon data from our survey study of 1,063 females 15-24yrs recruited from community- and clinic-based sites in two Ghanaian cities. Our Adolescent SRH Stigma Scale comprised 20 items and 3 sub-scales (Internalized, Enacted, Lay Attitudes) to measure stigma occurring with sexual activity, contraceptive use, pregnancy, abortion and family planning service use. We assessed relationships between a comprehensive set of demographic, health and social factors and SRH Stigma with multi-level multivariable linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In unadjusted bivariate analyses, compared to their counterparts, SRH stigma scores were higher among girls who were younger, Accra residents, Muslim, still in/dropped out of secondary school, unemployed, reporting excellent/very good health, not in a relationship, not sexually experienced, never received family planning services, never used contraception, but had been pregnant (all p-values &amp;lt;0.05). In multivariable models, higher SRH stigma scores were associated with history of pregnancy (β = 1.53, CI = 0.51,2.56) and excellent/very good self-rated health (β = 0.89, CI = 0.20,1.58), while lower stigma scores were associated with older age (β = -0.17, 95%CI = -0.24,-0.09), higher educational attainment (β = -1.22, CI = -1.82,-0.63), and sexual intercourse experience (β = -1.32, CI = -2.10,-0.55).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings provide insight into factors contributing to SRH stigma among this young Ghanaian female sample.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Different types of bone conduction transducers with different physical and electro-acoustic properties are available for audiometric hearing threshold measurements. The reference equivalent threshold vibratory force levels (RETVFL) specified in ISO 389–3 are based on measurements conducted with the B71 and KH70 transducers but apply to all types of transducers available for bone conduction audiometry. The objective of this study was to compare bone conduction hearing thresholds measured by different transducers.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;In a prospective study the hearing thresholds were measured psychometrically between 125 Hz and 8000 Hz using the Radioear B71, B81 and Präcitronic KH70 transducers.&lt;/p&gt; Study sample &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one normal hearing participants and fifteen hearing impaired participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In both groups significant differences were found between the thresholds measured with the different transducers at the low frequencies 125 Hz and 250 Hz and the high frequencies 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz and 8000 Hz.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Different types of bone conduction transducers with different physical and electro-acoustic properties are available for audiometric hearing threshold measurements. The reference equivalent threshold vibratory force levels (RETVFL) specified in ISO 389–3 are based on measurements conducted with the B71 and KH70 transducers but apply to all types of transducers available for bone conduction audiometry. The objective of this study was to compare bone conduction hearing thresholds measured by different transducers.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;In a prospective study the hearing thresholds were measured psychometrically between 125 Hz and 8000 Hz using the Radioear B71, B81 and Präcitronic KH70 transducers.&lt;/p&gt; Study sample &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one normal hearing participants and fifteen hearing impaired participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In both groups significant differences were found between the thresholds measured with the different transducers at the low frequencies 125 Hz and 250 Hz and the high frequencies 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz and 8000 Hz. In the normal hearing group, deviations from the reference threshold 0 dB HL towards lower thresholds were observed for the B71 and B81 at 125 Hz and at the high frequencies 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz and 8000 Hz.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RETVFL-values should be reassessed and provided specifically for the different transducers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523480400000</published><title>Influence of transducer types on bone conduction hearing thresholds</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-c?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-c?rss=1</link><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521740379000</published><author><name>Ash, C.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1373.3.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:4150438:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-c?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>f49f3ba8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Immunology, Physiology</item></keywords><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Metabolic syndrome, leaky guts, and infection</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283804v1?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283804v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283804v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Protein/RNA clusters arise frequently in spatially-regulated biological processes, from the asymmetric distribution of P granules and PAR proteins in developing embryos to localized receptor oligomers in migratory cells.

Background &lt;p&gt;Few studies have investigated the difference in bacterial contamination between conventional reused ventilator systems and disposable closed ventilator-suction systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial contamination rates of the reused and disposable ventilator systems, and the association between system disconnection and bacterial contamination of ventilator systems.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The enrolled intubated and mechanically ventilated patients used a conventional reused ventilator system and a disposable closed ventilator-suction system, respectively, for a week; specimens were then collected from the ventilator circuit systems to evaluate human and environmental bacterial contamination. The sputum specimens from patients were also analyzed in this study.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The detection rate of bacteria in the conventional reused ventilator system was substantially higher than that in the disposable ventilator system. The inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the disposable closed ventilator-suction system had higher bacterial concentrations than the conventional reused ventilator system. The bacterial concentration in the heated humidifier of the reused ventilator system was significantly higher than that in the disposable ventilator system. Positive associations existed among the bacterial concentrations at different locations in the reused and disposable ventilator systems, respectively. The predominant bacteria identified in the reused and disposable ventilator systems included &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter spp&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Elizabethkingia spp&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas spp&lt;/i&gt;., and &lt;i&gt;Stenotrophomonas (Xan) maltophilia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Both the reused and disposable ventilator systems had high bacterial contamination rates after one week of use.

We examine the seasonality of asthma-related hospital admissions in Melbourne, Australia, in particular the contribution and predictability of episodic thunderstorm asthma. Using a time-series ecological approach based on asthma admissions to Melbourne metropolitan hospitals, we identified seasonal peaks in asthma admissions that were centred in late February, June and mid-November. These peaks were most likely due to the return to school, winter viral infections and seasonal allergies, respectively. We performed non-linear statistical regression to predict daily admission rates as functions of the seasonal cycle, weather conditions, reported thunderstorms, pollen counts and air quality. Important predictor variables were the seasonal cycle and mean relative humidity in the preceding two weeks, with higher humidity associated with higher asthma admissions. Although various attempts were made to model asthma admissions, none of the models explained substantially more variation above that associated with the annual cycle. We also identified a list of high asthma admissions days (HAADs). Most HAADs fell in the late-February return-to-school peak and the November allergy peak, with the latter containing the greatest number of daily admissions. Many HAADs in the spring allergy peak may represent episodes of thunderstorm asthma, as they were associated with rainfall, thunderstorms, high ambient grass pollen levels and high humidity, a finding that suggests thunderstorm asthma is a recurrent phenomenon in Melbourne that occurs roughly once per five years. The rarity of thunderstorm asthma events makes prediction challenging, underscoring the importance of maintaining high standards of asthma management, both for patients and health professionals, especially during late spring and early summer.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Jeremy D.

The rarity of thunderstorm asthma events makes prediction challenging, underscoring the importance of maintaining high standards of asthma management, both for patients and health professionals, especially during late spring and early summer.</description><published>1523566800000</published><title>Seasonal asthma in Melbourne, Australia, and some observations on the occurrence of thunderstorm asthma and its predictability</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/157?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/157?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/157?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523554635000</published><author><name>Kimble, J.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/157.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fecea4:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><fingerprint>cb24f62a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>John Sulston (1942-2018)</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3978.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3978.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3978.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>A key question for understanding speech evolution is whether or not the vocalizations of our closest living relatives—nonhuman primates—represent the precursors to speech.

After all, messing around with that is what keeps everyone in the drug industry employed, and the unmessed varieties of such binding events are what keep us all vertical and above room temperature, so it’s a worthy subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental picture is of two proteins adopting complementary shapes along some kinds of binding surfaces. “Complementary” is doing a lot of work in that sentence, though, because we could be talking about hydrophobic interactions (whatever those are), hydrogen bonding, or outright charged residues that are pairing up positive/negative. In fact, since we’re talking about proteins here, all of these can be operating at the same time, and probably are. And there are all sorts of entropic/enthalpic things going on, too – things are happening to water molecules at the surface of the proteins as they come together (as well as to the bulk water that used to be between them), parts of each protein are probably moving around and getting more or less constrained, other internal interactions within each partner are adjusting, etc. It’s a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s still a somewhat orderly mess. In the end, these two complex three-dimensional shapes have found some sort of defined relationship that’s overall lower-energy than what they started with, and now this is their new shape. What if that’s not the case, though? This unnerving thought is brought on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25762&quot;&gt;by this paper&lt;/a&gt;, published late last month in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. We’re talking intrinsically disordered proteins again – those beasts, rather more common than was once thought, that have large sections of them that have no particular defined shape at all. (Indeed, some of them are disordered from snout to tail). I’ve generally thought of these, though, as flopping around in that way until they encounter a binding partner, at which point they settle down into some defined shape and slot themselves obligingly into my &lt;em&gt;weltanschauung&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As should have been quite clear by now, though, proteins don’t care what I think about them. This paper shows a particular protein interaction (between histone H1 and prothymosin-alpha) that is down in the picomolar affinity range. The histone protein has a small structured region in the middle, but the N- and C-terminals head off into complete disorder. Prothymosin is disordered all the way through. If you’d asked me about this at one time, I would have been certain that this sort of binding required the formation of a solid, well-defined structure with plenty of clear interactions. But that’s not what’s going on. The paper shows that &lt;em&gt;both proteins are still disordered even as a complex.&lt;/em&gt; In the NMR, you can see the structured globular part of the histone, but that’s the only order in sight. The circular dichroism spectra reflect this as well – the complex, in fact, is just the CD spectra of the two partners added on top of each other, with no sign of induced helicity, etc. The team did a whole series of FRET experiments, attaching the partner groups on a number of different residues, and there’s really no pattern to it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the interaction? Sheer charge. The partners are strongly positive/strongly negative, but they don’t seem to care what residues associate with what. Doubling the ionic strength of the buffer decreases the binding constant by &lt;em&gt;six orders of magnitude&lt;/em&gt;, so yeah, it’s pretty much an ionic thing all the way. They’re just shifting around unfolded on a 100ns-timescale, with no apparent need for anything more organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were already signs that something like this was going on. Such histone protein tails had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbc.org/content/281/4/1853&quot;&gt;already been shown&lt;/a&gt;, most disconcertingly, to bind their protein partners even when their sequences had been scrambled, and they’re not the only proteins that have demonstrated such behavior. It makes sense: if you don’t got no defined structure, you don’t need no defined sequence, right? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096800040700285X?via%3Dihub#bib11&quot;&gt;Here’s a good try&lt;/a&gt; at classifying protein binding along scales of static/dynamic and order/disorder, with this latest example falling thoroughly into the “dynamic disordered” quadrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should we think about this stuff? Well, for now, I’m modeling this in my head as “proteins have all sorts of binding modes that fit different needs in the cell”. There are some, obviously, that need pretty hard, defined structures both at their interface and in the other parts of the protein. There are some where a protein’s ordered regions bind other ordered regions, with disordered parts still boogieing around, and others where a totally disordered protein folds one end of its structure up into an ordered complex while still leaving the far end loose. All of that I’ve been able to handle without much problem. But, as this latest paper shows, we have to stretch this concept to include “disordered binding” itself. In these cases, I suppose that the key event is just bringing these proteins together somehow, without so much need for three-dimensional perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, it looks like these sorts of disordered binding modes may be a lot more common in the proteome than any of us thought. We’re all going to have to accommodate that reality, apparently. Are we going to be able to attack such things with small molecules, though? I have to say that given the choice, I would try something else first. With a disordered protein we’ve always been able to make the argument that binding something to it in its unstructured state might throw its conformational manifold off enough to disturb its function – and of course, targeting it in a structured binding complex is always theoretically possible right up front. But picomolar-level binding that has no defined structure at the binding interface? I will read about this with interest, and I will think about its implications, but I would not like to lead a drug discovery project against it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Let’s think for a bit about how proteins bind to each other.

Pearl millet is a cereal crop known for its high tolerance to drought, heat and salinity stresses as well as for its nutritional quality. The molecular mechanism of drought tolerance in pearl millet is unknown. Here we attempted to unravel the molecular basis of drought tolerance in two pearl millet inbred lines, ICMB 843 and ICMB 863 using RNA sequencing. Under greenhouse condition, ICMB 843 was found to be more tolerant to drought than ICMB 863. We sequenced the root transcriptome from both lines under control and drought conditions using an Illumina Hi-Seq platform, generating 139.1 million reads. Mapping of sequenced reads against the foxtail millet genome, which has been relatively well-annotated, led to the identification of several differentially expressed genes under drought stress. Total of 6799 and 1253 differentially expressed genes were found in ICMB 843 and ICMB 863, respectively. Pathway and gene function analysis by KEGG online tool revealed that the drought response in pearl millet is mainly regulated by pathways related to photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. The changes in expression of drought-responsive genes determined by RNA sequencing were confirmed by reverse-transcription PCR for 7 genes. These results are a first step to understanding the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance in pearl millet and lay a foundation for its genetic improvement.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Ambika Dudhate</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793638:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>46ff3c4c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ambika Dudhate, Harshraj Shinde, Daisuke Tsugama, Shenkui Liu, Tetsuo Takano&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of the study was to develop Tizanidine HCl (TZN) and Meloxicam (MLX) loaded bilayer mucoadhesive films intended for buccal administration, aiming to enhance the bioavailability. Bilayer films were prepared by solvent evaporation technique selecting arabinoxylan (ARX) as a sustained release (SR) layer forming polymer and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) E-15 as an immediate release (IR) layer-forming polymer. Prepared films were subjected to &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug release, surface morphology, mechanical strength, compatibility of the ingredients, drug contents, &lt;i&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/i&gt; mucoadhesion strength and drug permeation. Crossover study design was applied to study the i&lt;i&gt;n-vivo&lt;/i&gt; pharmacokinetics by using albino rabbits. Various pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; of both drugs loaded in films were compared with standard solution/dispersion administered to the rabbits at the dose of 1mg/kg. The results unveiled instant release and permeation of MLX from IR layer, while good controlled release and permeation characteristics of TZN from SR films over 8 h. films were of uniform thickness with smooth surface and satisfactory mechanical strength. Mucoadhesion strength was sufficient to provide suitable contact time with mucosal membrane. The pharmacokinetic study exhibited prompt absorption of MLX with better AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (6655.64 ng/ml*h vs 6538.99 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (436.98 ng/ml vs 411.33 ng/ml) from oral dispersion. Similarly buccal films has shown enhanced half-life (9.91hr vs 2.51 hr), AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (1043.4 ng/ml*h vs 149.1 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (91.92 ng/ml vs 42.29 ng/ml) from oral solution. A statistical investigation disclosed a significantly improved pharmacokinetics of TZN and MLX after their absorption across buccal route following administration of buccal film &lt;i&gt;(p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05)&lt;/i&gt;. ARX proved expedient and bilayer buccal films as a drug delivery system ascertained the dual effect of providing instant release of one active agent and persistent release of another one with improved pharmacokinetics.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Muhammad Zaman</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194410</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123926:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>7e821da9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Zaman, Muhammad Hanif, Zaib Ali Shaheryar&lt;/p&gt;

Prepared films were subjected to &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug release, surface morphology, mechanical strength, compatibility of the ingredients, drug contents, &lt;i&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/i&gt; mucoadhesion strength and drug permeation. Crossover study design was applied to study the i&lt;i&gt;n-vivo&lt;/i&gt; pharmacokinetics by using albino rabbits. Various pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; of both drugs loaded in films were compared with standard solution/dispersion administered to the rabbits at the dose of 1mg/kg. The results unveiled instant release and permeation of MLX from IR layer, while good controlled release and permeation characteristics of TZN from SR films over 8 h. films were of uniform thickness with smooth surface and satisfactory mechanical strength. Mucoadhesion strength was sufficient to provide suitable contact time with mucosal membrane. The pharmacokinetic study exhibited prompt absorption of MLX with better AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (6655.64 ng/ml*h vs 6538.99 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (436.98 ng/ml vs 411.33 ng/ml) from oral dispersion. Similarly buccal films has shown enhanced half-life (9.91hr vs 2.51 hr), AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (1043.4 ng/ml*h vs 149.1 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (91.92 ng/ml vs 42.29 ng/ml) from oral solution. A statistical investigation disclosed a significantly improved pharmacokinetics of TZN and MLX after their absorption across buccal route following administration of buccal film &lt;i&gt;(p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05)&lt;/i&gt;. ARX proved expedient and bilayer buccal films as a drug delivery system ascertained the dual effect of providing instant release of one active agent and persistent release of another one with improved pharmacokinetics.</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Development of Tizanidine HCl-Meloxicam loaded mucoadhesive buccal films: &amp;lt;i&gt;In-vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;in-vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; evaluation</title></item><item><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13421</originId><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13421</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/02/predation</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;“Beall’s List”, as a way to keep track of predatory publishers, has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/01/30/the-predatory-publishers-list-goes-dark&quot;&gt;officially offline&lt;/a&gt; for some time now. Jeffrey Beall himself has said that it was taken down under “intense pressure” from his employer (the University of Colorado at Denver), although his employer says no, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/18/librarians-list-predatory-journals-reportedly-removed-due-threats-and-politics&quot;&gt;not at all&lt;/a&gt;, this was his personal decision. (I know which side of that story I believe more). The businesses in this area are a touchy and litigious lot – well, at least in threatening to file lawsuits, anyway – and many legal departments would surely just rather not deal with all of the potential trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It now appears, though, that the list &lt;a href=&quot;https://beallslist.weebly.com/&quot;&gt;is back online&lt;/a&gt; in updated form, but is being &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02921-2&quot;&gt;maintained anonymously&lt;/a&gt;. One of the people behind it told &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; that they spend several hours a week dealing with inquiries and maintaining the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the journal titles aren’t already listed, the manager says they carry out an “in-depth analysis” of the publishers’ policies, checking them against a set of criteria originally laid out by Beall, and researching whether they are indexed on journal ‘whitelists’, such as the Directory of Open Access Journals or Journal Citation Reports. Journals or publishers deemed untrustworthy by the manager are included in an ‘update’ addendum on the blog. By March 2018, the new site had added 85 stand-alone journals and 27 publishers to Beall’s original lists of more than one thousand titles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for them. There are people who object to the idea that such journals are being called out anonymously, and there’s no doubt that the situation is open to potential abuse (although that doesn’t seem to be what’s happening so far). But what else to do when you’re barraged by threats if you do this work openly under your own name? Cabell’s is a company that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/07/25/cabells-new-predatory-journal-blacklist-review/&quot;&gt;taken on the challenge&lt;/a&gt;, with a subscription model blacklist (and whitelist), and it would be interesting to know what kind of flak they get from the hack publishers of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As that last link says, though, there can be some confusion (and has been on Cabell’s list and others) between low-quality journals and predatory ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So what are the problems? The most serious is that, as currently configured, Cabell’s Blacklist perpetuates the common problem of conflating low-quality journal publishing with deceptive or predatory publishing. In this case, the conflation happens because many of the blacklisting criteria Cabell’s applies are really quality criteria (“poor grammar and/or spelling,” “does not have a clearly stated peer review policy,” “no policy for digital preservation,” etc.) that can easily end up gathering fundamentally honest but less-competently-run journals into the same net as those journals that are actively trying to perpetrate a scam. Predatory and incompetent journals do often evince some of the same traits, but these traits don’t always indicate predatory intent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things overlap to a good degree, but not perfectly. Many of the predatory outfits, the we-have-three-hundred-journals-and-add-two-every-day folks, tend to be very sloppy and unprofessional quick-buck artists. But there are some rather slick ones, too, that at first glance don’t look that much different from actual journals. Meanwhile, there are actual journals, the smaller and/or newer ones, that can be rough around the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by an “actual journal”, then? There are perfectly good open-access journals, so we can’t say that the distinction is whether someone has to pay to read it. I’d say that the big distinction is some level of editorial control – and by that, I don’t only mean “Just a proportion of the papers make it in”, although that’s often the case. Even in more wide-open journals such as &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, papers are reviewed to make sure that they appear to be technically sound (they just don’t make calls on a paper’s impact or importance), and the same goes for many of the other respectable open-access titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings up another criterion: a real journal has some care for what it publishes. A fake or predatory journal, though, does not give a damn. Their reason to exist is to publish as many manuscripts as they can get and collect the payments for them, and if those manuscripts are faked, incoherent, or plagiarized? &lt;em&gt;Oh well.&lt;/em&gt; Did the payment clear? All right, then. Plenty of other journals and their publishers are trying to make money – and how – but their method of doing so runs through some variation of “Attain and preserve some level of respect from the readers and authors”. That’s as opposed to “Shear those sheep and keep the line moving”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to publish everything that comes in the door and maintain that respect, because the stuff that comes in that door is seriously contaminated with garbage. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/004641.html&quot;&gt;Here’s a famous post&lt;/a&gt; from the science-fiction publishing world, from editor Theresa Nielsen Hayden, called “Slushkiller”, about what comes in the transom where she works. About 70% of the submissions can be dismissed out of hand, usually within seconds, because the writing is &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; disjointed or incoherent. Another 25% of the stuff is written reasonably competently, but has a totally overused or borrowed plotline or has some other such flaw that would make it unsaleable. Now you’re down to the last five per cent or so, which is where the real editorial decisions actually start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific publishing is not as different as one might hope. I don’t know how many green-ink religious revelation manuscripts &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; get, but I’ll bet its a nonzero number. There are surely a lot of papers that come in written in such a disorganized manner that they cannot even be reviewed. Beyond that, there are many, many manuscripts that are readable and apparently not wrong, but are still not right for the journal they’ve been submitted to (often because of those impact and importance factors, which is where &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, etc. come in). &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, for example, has said that it rejects about 60% of submitted manuscripts without review, so although the proportion is a bit better than it was at Tor Books, it still means that a solid majority of all submissions don’t even clear the first hurdle of editorial attention. &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, for its part, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/15/plos-one-faced-decline-submissions-new-editor-speaks/&quot;&gt;said recently&lt;/a&gt; that it ends up rejecting about 50% of its submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast with a predatory journal could not be greater. They can, and do, publish whatever gibberish comes in, as long as the money is good, while all the time pretending to be what they are not. Editorial attention of any type is incompatible with their business model. That, to me, is the difference, and that is why these journals must be shunned.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>“Beall’s List”, as a way to keep track of predatory publishers, has been officially offline for some time now.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a granulomatous disease that has affected humanity for thousands of years. The production of cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, is fundamental in the formation and maintenance of granulomas and in the control of the disease. Recently, the introduction of TNF-α-blocking monoclonal antibodies, such as Infliximab, has brought improvements in the treatment of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, but this treatment also increases the risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Our objective was to analyze, in an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model, the influence of Infliximab on the granulomatous reactions and on the production of antigen-specific cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-12p40, IL-10 and IL-17) from beads sensitized with soluble Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) antigens cultured in the presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from TB patients. We evaluated 76 individuals, with tuberculosis active, treated and subjects with positive PPD. Granuloma formation was induced in the presence or absence of Infliximab for up to 10 days. The use of Infliximab in cultures significantly blocked TNF-α production (p &amp;lt;0.05), and led to significant changes in granuloma structure, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, only in the treated TB group. On the other hand, there was a significant reduction in the levels of IFN-γ, IL-12p40, IL-10 and IL-17 after TNF-α blockade in the three experimental groups (p &amp;lt;0.05). Taken together, our results demonstrate that TNF-α blockade by Infliximab directly influenced the structure of granuloma only in the treated TB group, but negatively modulated the production of Th1, Th17 and regulatory T cytokines in the three groups analyzed.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Djalma A.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). Natural killer cell responses play a crucial role in autoimmune disease through innate immunity, in which killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are closely involved. Although the genetic combination of KIRs with their specific HLA class I ligands has been associated with IBD in Caucasians, such KIR-HLA receptor-ligand combinations are not fully understood in the Japanese. We investigated 14 KIR genes along with HLA-Bw and -C ligands in 90 patients with UC and 50 patients with CD and compared them with the characteristics of 325 healthy control subjects. The frequency of HLA-Bw4 was significantly increased in patients with UC (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;; odds ratio [OR] = 3.39) and CD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0065; OR = 2.32) versus controls. The UC group had a significantly higher frequency of KIR2DS3 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024; OR = 1.94) and lower frequency of KIR2DS4 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019; OR = 0.40) and KIR2DL1-HLA-C2 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.035; OR = 0.47). The Tel-A/B haplotype was significantly decreased in UC patients (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0056; OR = 0.49).

Although associations between oral health and pneumonia have been reported in previous studies, particularly in the institutionalized elderly, few prospective studies have investigated the association between oral condition and pneumonia among community-dwelling people and whether the findings among inpatients or patients in nursing homes are applicable to the general population is still unclear. The oral bacteria propagated in the periodontal regions may drop into the lung and increase the risk of pneumonia. We, therefore, investigated the association of tooth loss with mortality from pneumonia in a cohort study of Japanese dentists. Members of the Japan Dental Association (JDA) participated in the LEMONADE (Longitudinal Evaluation of Multi-phasic, Odontological and Nutritional Associations in Dentists) Study. From 2001 to 2006, they completed a baseline questionnaire on lifestyle and health factors including the number of teeth lost (excluding third molars). We followed 19,775 participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 51.4 ± 11.7 years; 1,573 women [8.0%] and 18,202 men [92.0%]) for mortality from pneumonia (ICD-10, J12-J18). Mortality data were collected via the fraternal insurance program of the JDA. The hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with adjustment for sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, physical activity and diabetes history. During the median follow-up period of 9.5 years, we documented 68 deaths from pneumonia. Participants who were edentulous at baseline were at significantly increased risk of mortality from pneumonia. The multivariable-adjusted HRs were 2.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09–3.95) for the edentulous and 1.60 (95% CI, 0.83–3.10) for loss of 15–27 teeth relative to loss of 0–14 teeth (trend &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.026). The HR per one tooth loss was also significant; 1.031 (95% CI, 1.004–1.060). In conclusion, a large number of teeth lost may indicate an increased risk of mortality from pneumonia in community-dwelling populations.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Shino Suma</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793630:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>a79ebb1b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shino Suma, Mariko Naito, Kenji Wakai, Toru Naito, Masaaki Kojima, Osami Umemura, Makoto Yokota, Nobuhiro Hanada, Takashi Kawamura&lt;/p&gt;

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sensitive inflammatory marker rapidly increased in response to infection, injury or trauma during the acute phase. Resolution of the acute phase and SAA reduction are well documented, however the exact mechanism remains elusive. Two inducible SAA proteins, SAA1 and SAA2, with their variants could contribute to systemic inflammation. While unconjugated human variant SAA1α is already commercially available, the variants of SAA2 are not. Antibodies against SAA have been identified in apparently healthy blood donors (HBDs) in smaller, preliminary studies. So, our objective was to detect anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in the sera of 300 HBDs using ELISA, characterize their specificity and avidity. Additionally, we aimed to determine the presence of anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations and examine their effects on released IL-6 from SAA/SAA1α-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Autoantibodies against SAA and SAA1α had a median (IQR) absorbance OD (A&lt;sub&gt;450&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.655 (0.262–1.293) and 0.493 (0.284–0.713), respectively. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α exhibited heterogeneous to high avidity and reached peak levels between 41–50 years, then diminished with age in the oldest group (51–67 years). Women consistently exhibited significantly higher levels than men. Good positive correlation was observed between anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α were detected in IVIg, their fractions subsequently isolated, and shown to decrease IL-6 protein levels released from SAA/SAA1α-treated PBMCs. In conclusion, naturally occurring antibodies against SAA and anti-SAA1α could play a physiological role in down-regulating their antigen and proinflammatory cytokines leading to the resolution of the acute phase and could be an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Tadeja Kuret</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195346</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575fc:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>bbb665c1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tadeja Kuret, Katja Lakota, Polonca Mali, Saša Čučnik, Sonja Praprotnik, Matija Tomšič, Snezna Sodin-Semrl&lt;/p&gt;
Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sensitive inflammatory marker rapidly increased in response to infection, injury or trauma during the acute phase. Resolution of the acute phase and SAA reduction are well documented, however the exact mechanism remains elusive. Two inducible SAA proteins, SAA1 and SAA2, with their variants could contribute to systemic inflammation. While unconjugated human variant SAA1α is already commercially available, the variants of SAA2 are not. Antibodies against SAA have been identified in apparently healthy blood donors (HBDs) in smaller, preliminary studies. So, our objective was to detect anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in the sera of 300 HBDs using ELISA, characterize their specificity and avidity. Additionally, we aimed to determine the presence of anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations and examine their effects on released IL-6 from SAA/SAA1α-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Autoantibodies against SAA and SAA1α had a median (IQR) absorbance OD (A&lt;sub&gt;450&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.655 (0.262–1.293) and 0.493 (0.284–0.713), respectively.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Negative workplace behaviour, especially negative communication is a recognised problem in many organisations and is known to have serious impact on workplace performance, productivity and personal wellbeing. Emergency Departments (ED) can be high stress environments in which communication and perceptions of respect between physicians and other staff may underlie individual functioning. We conducted a study to estimate the influence of incivility (ICV) among physicians in the ED.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed an online survey to assess workplace incivility in the ED. We focussed on frequency, origin, reasons and situations where ICV was reported. To measure the levels and the potential influence of ICV on psychological safety, social stress and personal wellbeing we correlated our questionnaire to standard psychological scales. Statistical analysis included Students t-test, chi squared distribution and Pearson correlation coefficient.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We invited all seventy-seven ED physicians to participate in our survey. Among those that completed (n = 50, 65%) the survey, 9% of ED physicians reported frequent (1/week) and 38% occasional (1/month) incidents of ICV. 28% of physicians reported experiencing ICV once per quarter and 21% reported a frequency of only once per year, no physician reported ICV on a daily basis. Levels of ICV were significantly higher in interactions with specialists from outside then within the ED (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).ICV was perceived particularly during critical situations. Our findings showed a significant correlation between internal (within the ED team) ICV and psychological safety. To ED physicians internal ICV was associated with lower levels of psychological safety (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). ICV displayed from sources outside the ED team was not associated with psychological safety, but we found a significant influence of external ICV on personal irritability and reduced wellbeing (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of incivility was high among the ED physicians. Although this was a small sample, the association between workplace ICV and psychological safety, personal irritation as well personal comfort suggests that ICV may be an important variable underlying ED team performance. These findings further underscore the need to foster a culture of respect and good communication between departments, as levels of ICV were highest with physicians from outside the ED. Future research would benefit from examining strategies to prevent and reduce ICV and identify reasons for personal variation in perception of ICV. During critical situations and in general collaboration with specialists, awareness of ICV and countermeasures are important to avoid decreased performance and negative impact on staff and patient.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Karsten Klingberg</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194933</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0b:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>9c69324b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karsten Klingberg, Khaled Gadelhak, Sabrina N.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies has investigated majority influence in nonhuman animals. However, due to both terminological and methodological issues, evidence for conformity in nonhuman animals is scarce and controversial. Preliminary evidence suggests that wild birds, wild monkeys, and fish show conformity, that is, forgoing personal information in order to copy the majority.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies has investigated majority influence in nonhuman animals. However, due to both terminological and methodological issues, evidence for conformity in nonhuman animals is scarce and controversial. Preliminary evidence suggests that wild birds, wild monkeys, and fish show conformity, that is, forgoing personal information in order to copy the majority. By contrast, chimpanzees seem to lack this tendency. The present study is the first to examine whether dogs (&lt;i&gt;Canis familiaris)&lt;/i&gt; show conformity. Specifically, we tested whether dogs conform to a majority of conspecifics rather than stick to what they have previously learned. After dogs had acquired a behavioral preference via training (i.e., shaping), they were confronted with counter-preferential behavior of either no, one or three conspecifics. Traditional frequentist analyses show that the dogs’ behavior did not differ significantly between the three conditions. Complementary Bayesian analyses suggest that our data provide moderate evidence for the null hypothesis. In conclusion, our results suggest that dogs stick to what they have learned rather than conform to the counter-preferential behavior of others. We discuss the possible statistical and methodological limitations of this finding. Furthermore, we take a functional perspective on conformity and discuss under which circumstances dogs might show conformity after all.</description><published>1521838800000</published><title>Dogs (&amp;lt;i&gt;Canis familiaris&amp;lt;/i&gt;) stick to what they have learned rather than conform to their conspecifics’ behavior</title></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Evaluating_the_London_Dispersion_Coefficients_of_Protein_Force_Fields_Using_the_Exchange-Hole_Dipole_Moment_Model/6024410</originId><published>1522022400000</published><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Evaluating_the_London_Dispersion_Coefficients_of_Protein_Force_Fields_Using_the_Exchange-Hole_Dipole_Moment_Model/6024410</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><engagement>7</engagement><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Evaluating_the_London_Dispersion_Coefficients_of_Protein_Force_Fields_Using_the_Exchange-Hole_Dipole_Moment_Model/6024410</link><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16262e106e0:59e9bde:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522077337312</crawled><fingerprint>888e9bb1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><description>London dispersion is one of the fundamental intermolecular interactions involved in protein folding and dynamics. The popular CHARMM36, Amber ff14sb, and OPLS-AA force fields represent these interactions through the C6 /r 6 term of the Lennard-Jones potential.

In this work, dispersion coefficients of all three force fields were compared to correspondingvalues from quantum-chemical calculations using the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) model.

Despite having large C 6 dispersion coefficients, these force fields predict side-chain hydration energies that are in generally good agreement with the experimental values, including for hydrocarbon residues where the dispersion component is the dominant attractive solute–solvent interaction. This suggests that these force fields predict the correct total strength of dispersion interactions, despite C6 coefficients that are considerably larger than XDM predicts. An analytical expression for the water–methane dispersion energy using XDM dispersion coefficients shows that that higher-order dispersion terms(i.e., C 8 and C 10 ) account for roughly 37.5% of the hydration energy of methane.

Amino acid signaling mediated by the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is fundamental to cell growth and metabolism. However, how cells negatively regulate amino acid signaling remains largely unknown. Here, we show that interaction between 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc), a subunit of multiple amino acid transporters, and the multifunctional hub protein girders of actin filaments (Girdin) down-regulates mTORC1 activity. 4F2hc interacts with Girdin in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)- and amino acid signaling–dependent manners to translocate to the lysosome. The resultant decrease in cell surface 4F2hc leads to lowered cytoplasmic glutamine (Gln) and leucine (Leu) content, which down-regulates amino acid signaling. Consistently, Girdin depletion augments amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation and inhibits amino acid deprivation–induced autophagy. These findings uncovered the mechanism underlying negative regulation of amino acid signaling, which may play a role in tightly regulated cell growth and metabolism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tMWvVxdBQbk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005090</href></item></canonical><engagement>2</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005090</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162259eed6a:493921:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521049595242</crawled><fingerprint>4afaf308</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Liang Weng, Yi-Peng Han, Atsushi Enomoto, Yasuyuki Kitaura, Shushi Nagamori, Yoshikatsu Kanai, Naoya Asai, Jian An, Maki Takagishi, Masato Asai, Shinji Mii, Takashi Masuko, Yoshiharu Shimomura, Masahide Takahashi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The comparison between long acting insulin analogues (LAIA) and human insulin (NPH) has been investigated for decades, with many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews giving mixed results. This overlapping and contradictory evidence has increased uncertainty on coverage decisions at health systems level.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To conduct an overview of systematic reviews and update existing reviews, preparing new meta-analysis to determine whether LAIA are effective for T1D patients compared to NPH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified systematic reviews of RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of LAIA glargine or detemir, compared to NPH insulin for T1D, assessing glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and hypoglycemia. Data sources included Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and hand-searching. The methodological quality of studies was independently assessed by two reviewers, using AMSTAR and Jadad scale. We found 11 eligible systematic reviews that contained a total of 25 relevant clinical trials. Two reviewers independently abstracted data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found evidence that LAIA are efficacious compared to NPH, with estimates showing a reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia episodes (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.57; 0.76) and A1C (95% CI 0.23; 0.12). No significance was found related to severe hypoglycemia (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.71; 1.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study design has allowed us to carry out the most comprehensive assessment of RCTs on this subject, filling a gap in diabetes research.

Aranbaltza is an archaeological complex formed by at least three open-air sites. Between 2014 and 2015 a test excavation carried out in Aranbaltza III revealed the presence of a sand and clay sedimentary sequence formed in floodplain environments, within which six sedimentary units have been identified. This sequence was formed between 137–50 ka, and includes several archaeological horizons, attesting to the long-term presence of Neanderthal communities in this area. One of these horizons, corresponding with Unit 4, yielded two wooden tools. One of these tools is a beveled pointed tool that was shaped through a complex operational sequence involving branch shaping, bark peeling, twig removal, shaping, polishing, thermal exposition and chopping. A use-wear analysis of the tool shows it to have traces related with digging soil so it has been interpreted as representing a digging stick. This is the first time such a tool has been identified in a European Late Middle Palaeolithic context; it also represents one of the first well-preserved Middle Palaeolithic wooden tool found in southern Europe. This artefact represents one of the few examples available of wooden tool preservation for the European Palaeolithic, allowing us to further explore the role wooden technologies played in Neanderthal communities.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Joseba Rios-Garaizar</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195044</canonicalUrl><engagement>48</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4254:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>3d1a2f4e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joseba Rios-Garaizar, Oriol López-Bultó, Eneko Iriarte, Carlos Pérez-Garrido, Raquel Piqué, Arantza Aranburu, María José Iriarte-Chiapusso, Illuminada Ortega-Cordellat, Laurence Bourguignon, Diego Garate, Iñaki Libano&lt;/p&gt;

In the present study, we examined the effects of different drying conditions on the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages. We approached this objective by comparing invertebrate assemblages in perennial and intermittent sites along two intermittent Mediterranean streams with contrasting predictability, duration, and spatial patterns of drying: Fuirosos (high predictability, short duration, downstream drying pattern) and Rogativa (low predictability, long duration, patchy drying pattern). Specifically, we quantified the contribution of individual taxa to those differences, the degree of nestedness, and shifts in the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages along flow intermittence gradients. We observed greater effects of drying on the benthic invertebrate composition in Fuirosos than in Rogativa, resulting in a higher dissimilarity of assemblages between perennial and intermittent sites, as well as a lower degree of nestedness. Furthermore, a higher number of biotic metrics related to richness, abundance and biological traits were significantly different between perennial and intermittent sites in Fuirosos, despite a shorter dry period compared to Rogativa. At the same time, slightly different responses were detected during post-drying (autumn) than pre-drying (spring) conditions in this stream. In Rogativa, shifts in benthic invertebrate assemblages along increasing gradients of flow intermittence were found for three metrics (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) and Odonata, Coleoptera and Heteroptera (OCH) abundances and aerial active dispersal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combined gradients of dry period duration and distance to nearest perennial reach can generate complex, and different, responses of benthic invertebrate assemblages, depending on the flow intermittence metric. Our study advances the notion that special attention should be paid to the predictability, duration and spatial patterns of drying in intermittent streams in order to disentangle the effects of drying on benthic invertebrate assemblages, in particular in areas subject to high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in drying conditions.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>María Mar Sánchez-Montoya</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193933</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2807:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>2ad5a22a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by María Mar Sánchez-Montoya, Daniel von Schiller, Gonzalo G.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that combined gradients of dry period duration and distance to nearest perennial reach can generate complex, and different, responses of benthic invertebrate assemblages, depending on the flow intermittence metric. Our study advances the notion that special attention should be paid to the predictability, duration and spatial patterns of drying in intermittent streams in order to disentangle the effects of drying on benthic invertebrate assemblages, in particular in areas subject to high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in drying conditions.</description><published>1522270800000</published><title>Understanding the effects of predictability, duration, and spatial pattern of drying on benthic invertebrate assemblages in two contrasting intermittent streams</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193957</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193957</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193957</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Li Chen, Jilei Zhang, Jiawei Wang, Patrick Butaye, Patrick Kelly, Min Li, Feng Yang, Jiansen Gong, Afrah Kamal Yassin, Weina Guo, Jing Li, Chunlian Song, Chengming Wang&lt;/p&gt;
Antimicrobial resistance against colistin has emerged worldwide threatening the efficacy of one of the last-resort antimicrobials used for the treatment of &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriacea&lt;/i&gt;e. To investigate the presence of the recently identified colistin resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt;) in China, we established PCRs to detect &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;5 on 213 anal and 1,339 nasal swabs from apparently healthy pigs (n = 1,454) in nine provinces, and 1,696 cloacal and 1,647 oropharyngeal samples from poultry (n = 1,836) at live-bird markets in 24 provinces of China. The prevalence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; in swine swabs (41.4%; 642/1,552) was significantly higher than in swabs from poultry (11.5%; 384/3,343). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; gene was found in geese (49.5%, 54/109), chickens (17.2%, 257/1,498), pigeons (17.2%, 17/99) and ducks (15.4%, 20/130). In a similar trend, the prevalence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; in swine swabs (33.1%; 514/1552) was significantly higher than in swabs from poultry (5.6%; 187/3,343). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; was identified in geese (17.4%, 19/109), chickens (9.9%, 148/1,498), ducks (7.7%, 10/130) and pigeons (3%, 3/99). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;4 prevalence in the nasal swabs from pigs (59.2%, 58/98) was significantly higher than that in anal swabs (29.6%, 29/98) (P&amp;lt;0.001). Similarly, the &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; prevalence in the nasal swabs from pigs (61.2%, 60/98) was significantly higher than in anal swabs (44.9%, 44/98) (P = 0.02), and significantly higher in oropharyngeal swabs (7.2%, 109/1,507) than in the cloacal swabs (3.7%, 56/1,507) (P&amp;lt;0.001). This study further confirms the presence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; in animals and indicates these genes are prevalent and widespread in food producing animals (pig and poultry) in China.

Depression is a common issue in institutionalized elderly people. The “Attentively Embracing Story” theory is applied to help individuals transform negative thoughts into positive, and reflect on spiritual healing. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a “Story-Centred Care Intervention Program” based on the “Attentively Embracing Story” theory in improving depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and heart rate variability in institutionalized elderly people. Seventy long-term care residents were recruited from two long-term care facilities and randomized into the story-centred care intervention (n = 35) and control groups (n = 35). We excluded five long-term care residents who did not complete the post-test measures and five long-term care residents who had interference events on the outcome measures. Finally, sixty long-term care residents (40 women and 20 men; age 84.3±5.98 years) were included in the final analysis.

Depression is a common issue in institutionalized elderly people. The “Attentively Embracing Story” theory is applied to help individuals transform negative thoughts into positive, and reflect on spiritual healing. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a “Story-Centred Care Intervention Program” based on the “Attentively Embracing Story” theory in improving depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and heart rate variability in institutionalized elderly people. Seventy long-term care residents were recruited from two long-term care facilities and randomized into the story-centred care intervention (n = 35) and control groups (n = 35). We excluded five long-term care residents who did not complete the post-test measures and five long-term care residents who had interference events on the outcome measures. Finally, sixty long-term care residents (40 women and 20 men; age 84.3±5.98 years) were included in the final analysis. Data were collected at four times (pre-intervention and post-intervention, 1 and 3-month follow-up) and analyzed with the generalized estimating equation approach.Instruments, including Geriatric Depression Scale, Short Portable Mind Status Questionnaire, and a CheckMyHeart device to measure heart rate variability, were used in study. The degree of improvement in depressive symptoms was significantly higher in the story-centred care intervention group than in the control group after providing the story-centred care intervention program (p &amp;lt; .001) and at 1 and 3-month follow-up (p = .001, p = .006, respectively; GDS-15 score reduced 1.816 at the 3-month follow-up). Participants receiving the story-centred care intervention program showed significantly greater improvement than those in the control group in the cognitive function at 1and 3-month follow-up (p = .009, p = .024, respectively; SPMSQ score reduced 0.345 at the 3-month follow-up). The heart rate variability parameters (SDNN, RMSSD) did not show a statistically significant increase. However an increasing trend in the parameters was observed in the intervention group (SDNN increased 16.235ms at the 3-month follow-up; RMSSD increased 16.424 ms at the 3-month follow-up).

Chronic constipation is a functional gastrointestinal disease that is detrimental to the quality of patient life. &lt;i&gt;Cassia obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; L. (CO) and &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; M. (FV) are commonly used as medicinal foods in many countries. We aimed to examine the laxative effect and their underlying mechanism of CO and FV mixture on loperamide (lop)-induced constipated rats. To determine the laxative effects of these compounds, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: the control, lop-induced constipated (2mg/kg), and three doses (100, 300, and 500mg/kg) of CO and FV mixture-, and Bisacodyl (bis, 3.3mg/kg)-treated groups. The mixture of CO and FV and bis were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks. For induction of constipation, the lop were treated with a dose of 2 mg/kg twice a day on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week after treatments of CO and FV extracts and bis. The results were revealed that the CO and FV mixture has the laxative effects more than those in CO and FV-alone treatments on constipated rats by determining the stool parameters, including stool number and weight. Indeed, stool parameters, such as, stool number, weight, and water contents and colonic peristalsis from the intestinal transit length and ratio were dramatically improved by CO and FV mixture treatment. Histological study also revealed that CO and FV mixture enhanced the thicknesses of mucosa and muscular layers of the colon in constipated rats. For their underlying mechanism, the mRNAs and proteins expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR) M2 and M3 and their downstream signaling were preserved by CO and FV mixture treatment in constipated rats. Therefore, this study suggests that treatment with CO and FV mixture has beneficial effects against constipation. We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Seung Hee Jang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195624</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d748:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>302f39ea</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Hee Jang, Dong Kwon Yang&lt;/p&gt;

We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</description><published>1522962000000</published><title>The combination of &amp;lt;i&gt;Cassia obtusifolia&amp;lt;/i&gt; L. and &amp;lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&amp;lt;/i&gt; M. exhibits a laxative effect on loperamide-induced constipation of rats</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-d?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-d?rss=1</link><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523554635000</published><author><name>Hines, P.

The hypothesis that pigs placed on diets with reduced indispensable amino acid (AA) content attempts to offset the reduction in the nutrient density with increased feed intake was tested. In the experiment, feeds with a high or a low AA content were administrated to pigs fed &lt;i&gt;ad-libitum&lt;/i&gt; or restrictively according to a 2 × 2 factorial design. Ninety-six barrows were housed in 8 pens (12 pigs/pen) equipped with automatic feeders. Within pen, and from 47 body weight (BW) onwards, 6 pigs were fed &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt;. The others pigs were allowed to consume, as a maximum, the feed amounts indicated by the breeding company feeding plane to optimize the feed efficiency. In early (86–118 kg BW) and late (118–145 kg BW) finishing, the pigs of 4 pens received feeds with high indispensable AA contents (8.1 and 7.5 g lysine/kg in the two periods, respectively). The other pigs received feeds with reduced indispensable AA contents (lysine, methionine, threonine and tryptophan) by 9 and 18% in early and late finishing, respectively.

It is an absolute requirement that every time you write about graphene that you mention that the breakthrough in its isolation came from the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0218/230218-graphene-sticky-tape&quot;&gt;adhesive tape&lt;/a&gt;, a low-tech insight at Manchester that led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/&quot;&gt;Nobel&lt;/a&gt; and kicked off a massive field of research. The latest is that earlier this month, a group at MIT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02773-w&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that if you bring two graphene sheets together, parallel but at a slightly different rotational angle (about 1.1 degrees), that the system becomes a superconductor at low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was already unexpected, but the behavior of the material (electron density versus temperature) suggests some real similarities to the copper-oxide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity&quot;&gt;high-temperature superconductors&lt;/a&gt;, and no one saw that coming, either. (Note that “high temperature”, in this field, still means “can be reached in liquid nitrogen as opposed to liquid helium”). Despite a really impressive amount of theoretical and experimental work on the cuprate materials, the full details of their superconductivity are still a matter of debate. It seems to come down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair&quot;&gt;Cooper pairs&lt;/a&gt; (as with the classic low-temperature superconductors, but the mechanism of the electron pairing is different and in ways that still start arguments. This new graphene systems might be able to shed some light on the various proposals, and you can be certain that a great deal of late-night coffee has been consumed in recent weeks to come up with appropriate experiments along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical value of such an understanding could well be huge (and there is, of course, another near-certain Nobel in physics waiting for whoever puts the field on a firmer basis). To give another recent MIT-related example, new superconductor engineering is at the heart of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-newly-formed-company-launch-novel-approach-fusion-power-0309&quot;&gt;recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; the university made about fusion power. The belief is that large-bore magnets of such materials, which now appear feasible, could allow a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak&quot;&gt;tokamak&lt;/a&gt;-design fusion reactor that is far more compact than any previous attempts. Wrestling with the magnets is one of the biggest problems in designing such machines, because you need extremely strong, extremely homogeneous fields. The high-temperature superconductors were recognized early on as having great possibilities in this area, but the first fusion reactor that used only these materials only became operational in 2014 (a spherical tokamak design at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Tokamak Energy&lt;/a&gt; in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphene-layer materials are still operating at very low temperatures – but considering their electron density, it’s actually a lot higher than it should be. No one is going to be make fusion reactors with twisted-graphite magnets any time soon, but twisted graphite might possibly be the platform that leads us to the magnets that fusion reactors will use.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>I wanted to mention something on the border between chemistry and physics that might well turn out to be important.

Adapting community-based protected areas to local context and evaluating their success across a range of possible socio-economic and ecological outcomes depends, in part, on understanding the perceptions of local actors. This article presents results from a mixed methods study that focuses on how and why religious identity, a prominent aspect of Ghanaian culture, is related to perceptions of the performance of several Community Resource Management Areas (CREMAs). CREMAs are a form of Ghanaian protected area that emphasizes community participation and a range of socio-economic and ecological objectives. Using importance-satisfaction analysis, large-scale survey results show that respondents that identify as Christians consistently assign greater importance to CREMA outcomes than do those that identify with Traditional religions. Education and whether respondents were native to an area (both of which were correlated with religious identity) were also systematically related to perceptions of CREMA importance, with those that are educated and non-native to an area tending to assign higher importance to CREMA outcomes. Follow up focus group participants from the Avu Lagoon CREMA suggest that the patterns result from differing ‘openness’ to new ideas, relative dependence on natural resources, acceptance of Traditional practices associated with conservation, and a sense, for some, that ecological conditions are divinely ordained. Christianity, education and non-nativity are associated with much larger performance gaps, particularly with respect to socio-economic impacts. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for conservation interventions and the use of perceptions in assessing protected area performance.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Grant Murray</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195498</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>9befc27c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Grant Murray, Andrew Agyare&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; is the most speciose genus of the order Cingulata, including approximately 40% of known living armadillos. Nine species are currently recognized, although comprehensive analyses of the entire genus have never been done. Our aim is to revise the taxonomy of the long-nosed armadillos and properly define the taxa. We examined 2126 specimens of &lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; preserved in 39 different museum collections, including 17 type specimens. Three complementary methods were applied to explore morphological datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative morphological variation in discrete characters was assessed by direct observations of specimens. Linear morphometric variation was based on external data and cranial measurements of 887 adult skulls. The shape and size of the skull was abstracted through two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of dorsal, lateral and ventral views of respectively 421, 211, and 220 adult specimens. Our results converge on the recognition of eight living species (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;beniensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kappleri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mazzai&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;novemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pastasae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pilosus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sabanicola&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;), and three subspecies of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hybridus&lt;/i&gt;, and a new subspecies from Cordoba described here).

Our first aim was to compare the anaerobic threshold (AnT) determined by the incremental protocol with the reverse lactate threshold test (RLT), investigating the previous cycling experience effect. Secondarily, an alternative RLT application based on heart rate was proposed. Two groups (12 per group-according to cycling experience) were evaluated on cycle ergometer. The incremental protocol started at 25 W with increments of 25 W at each 3 minutes, and the AnT was calculated by bissegmentation, onset of blood lactate concentration and maximal deviation methods. The RLT was applied in two phases: a) lactate priming segment; and b) reverse segment; the AnT (AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt;) was calculated based on a second order polynomial function. The AnT from the RLT was calculated based on the heart rate (AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt;) by the second order polynomial function. In regard of the Study 1, most of statistical procedures converged for similarity between the AnT determined from the bissegmentation method and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt;. For 83% of non-experienced and 75% of experienced subjects the bias was 4% and 2%, respectively. In Study 2, no difference was found between the AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt; and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt;. For 83% of non-experienced and 91% of experienced subjects, the bias between AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt; and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt; was similar (i.e. 6%). In summary, the AnT determined by the incremental protocol and RLT are consistent. The AnT can be determined during the RLT via heart rate, improving its applicability. However, future studies are required to improve the agreement between variables.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Leonardo Henrique Dalcheco Messias</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194313</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d6d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>f1393110</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leonardo Henrique Dalcheco Messias, Emanuel Elias Camolese Polisel, Fúlvia Barros Manchado-Gobatto&lt;/p&gt;

However, future studies are required to improve the agreement between variables.</description><published>1520974800000</published><title>Advances of the reverse lactate threshold test: Non-invasive proposal based on heart rate and effect of previous cycling experience</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Grobe, Andrea Wüstenhagen, Christian Baarlink, Robert Grosse, Katharina Grikscheit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; formation of epithelial cell-cell contacts relies on actin-based protrusions as well as tightly controlled turnover of junctional actin once cells encounter each other and adhesion complexes assemble. The specific contributions of individual actin regulators on either protrusion formation or junctional actin turnover remain largely unexplored. Based on our previous findings of Formin-like 2 (FMNL2)-mediated control of junctional actin dynamics, we investigated its potential role in membrane protrusions and impact on newly forming epithelial contacts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of FMNL2 in human MCF10A cells combined with optogenetic control of Rac1 activity confirmed its critical function in the establishment of intercellular contacts. While lamellipodial protrusion rates remained unaffected, FMNL2 knockout cells were characterized by impaired filopodia formation similar to depletion of the Rho GTPase Cdc42. Silencing of Cdc42, however, failed to affect FMNL2-mediated contact formation. Hence, we propose a cell-cell contact-specific and Rac1-mediated function of FMNL2 entirely independent of Cdc42. Consistent with this, direct visualizations of native epithelial junction formation revealed a striking and specifically Rac1- and not Cdc42-dependent recruitment of FMNL2 to newly forming junctions as well as established cell-cell contacts within epithelial sheets.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Hanna Grobe</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f3:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>f712f6c3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Grobe, Andrea Wüstenhagen, Christian Baarlink, Robert Grosse, Katharina Grikscheit&lt;/p&gt;

Landscape connectivity is integral to the persistence of metapopulations of wide ranging carnivores and other terrestrial species. The objectives of this research were to investigate the landscape characteristics essential to use of areas by lynx and bobcats in northern New England, map a habitat availability model for each species, and explore connectivity across areas of the region likely to experience future development pressure. A Mahalanobis distance analysis was conducted on location data collected between 2005 and 2010 from 16 bobcats in western Vermont and 31 lynx in northern Maine to determine which variables were most consistent across all locations for each species using three scales based on average 1) local (15 minute) movement, 2) linear distance between daily locations, and 3) female home range size. The bobcat model providing the widest separation between used locations and random study area locations suggests that they cue into landscape features such as edge, availability of cover, and development density at different scales. The lynx model with the widest separation between random and used locations contained five variables including natural habitat, cover, and elevation—all at different scales. Shrub scrub habitat—where lynx’s preferred prey is most abundant—was represented at the daily distance moved scale. Cross validation indicated that outliers had little effect on models for either species. A habitat suitability value was calculated for each 30 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; pixel across Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine for each species and used to map connectivity between conserved lands within selected areas across the region. Projections of future landscape change illustrated potential impacts of anthropogenic development on areas lynx and bobcat may use, and indicated where connectivity for bobcats and lynx may be lost. These projections provided a guide for conservation of landscape permeability for lynx, bobcat, and species relying on similar habitats in the region.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Laura E.

The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is an evolutionary conserved cholesterol binding protein localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Expression of TSPO is upregulated in activated microglia in various neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic disorders. Therefore, TSPO radioligands are used as biomarkers in positron emission tomography (PET) studies. In particular, a common A147T polymorphism in the TSPO gene affects binding of several high affinity TSPO radioligands. Given the relevance of TSPO as a diagnostic biomarker in disease processes, we systematically searched for mutations in the human TSPO gene by a wide array of evolution and structure based bioinformatics tools and identified potentially deleterious missense mutations. The two most frequently observed missense mutations A147T and R162H were further analysed in structural models of human wildtype and mutant TSPO proteins. The effects of missense mutations were studied on the atomic level using molecular dynamics simulations. To analyse putative effects of A147T and R162H variants on protein stability we established primary dermal fibroblast cultures from wt and homozygous A147T and R162H donors. Stability of endogenous TSPO protein, which is abundantly expressed in fibroblasts, was studied using cycloheximide protein degradation assay. Our data show that the A147T mutation significantly alters the flexibility and stability of the mutant protein. Furthermore both A147T and R162H mutations decreased the half-life of the mutant proteins by about 25 percent, which could in part explain its effect on reduced pregnenolone production and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study is the first comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of genetic variants in the TSPO gene, thereby extending the knowledge about the clinical relevance of TSPO nsSNPs.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Vladimir M.

The Service is divided into a clinic (SIS-C) where all referred children undergo a pre-vaccination visit and an area within the Pediatric Emergency Department (SIS-PED) where children are vaccinated if indicated.

Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms play a pivotal role in the regulation of numerous cellular functions, making them extensively studied and highly attractive drug targets. Utilizing the crystal structure of the PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; C1B domain, we have developed hydrophobic isophthalic acid derivatives that modify PKC functions by binding to the C1 domain of the enzyme. In the present study, we aimed to improve the drug-like properties of the isophthalic acid derivatives by increasing their solubility and enhancing the binding affinity.

We describe the development and application of a suite of modular tools for high-resolution detection of proteins and intracellular protein complexes by electron microscopy (EM). Conditionally stable GFP- and mCherry-binding nanobodies (termed csGBP and csChBP, respectively) are characterized using a cell-free expression and analysis system and subsequently fused to an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) enzyme. Expression of these cassettes alongside fluorescently labelled proteins results in recruitment and stabilisation of APEX, whereas unbound APEX nanobodies are efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This greatly simplifies correlative analyses, enables detection of less-abundant proteins, and eliminates the need to balance expression levels between fluorescently labelled and APEX nanobody proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system to bimolecular complementation (‘EM split-fluorescent protein’), for localisation of protein–protein interactions at the ultrastructural level.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrmHIECypRw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005473</href></item></canonical><engagement>6</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005473</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e9:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522950975641</crawled><fingerprint>9519aa11</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas Ariotti, James Rae, Nichole Giles, Nick Martel, Emma Sierecki, Yann Gambin, Thomas E.

Thus far, HD algorithms are evaluated using scalar metrics, such as root-mean-square error, that fail to quantify the structure of errors caused by the structure of the sample. Here, we show that the spatial distribution of localization errors within super-resolved images of biological structures are vectorial in nature, leading to systematic structural biases that severely degrade image resolution. We further demonstrate that the shape of the microscope&apos;s point-spread function (PSF) fundamentally affects the characteristics of imaging artifacts. We built a Robust Statistical Estimation algorithm (RoSE) to minimize these biases for arbitrary structures and PSFs. RoSE accomplishes this minimization by estimating the likelihood of blinking events to localize molecules more accurately and eliminate false localizations. Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Mazidi, H.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/03/293670</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1628b0f58db:927c621:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522751461595</crawled><fingerprint>2da0cb1a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><description>Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) depends on sequential detection and localization of individual molecular blinking events.

We further demonstrate that the shape of the microscope&apos;s point-spread function (PSF) fundamentally affects the characteristics of imaging artifacts. We built a Robust Statistical Estimation algorithm (RoSE) to minimize these biases for arbitrary structures and PSFs. RoSE accomplishes this minimization by estimating the likelihood of blinking events to localize molecules more accurately and eliminate false localizations. Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description><published>1522738800000</published><title>Minimizing Structural Bias in Single-Molecule Super-Resolution Microscopy [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00714</originId><author><name>Collins Nganou, Noam Adir, Martin Mkandawire</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/GxIVJT1qgbc/acs.jpcb.8b00714</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><visual><width>441</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>500</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00714/20180315/images/medium/jp-2018-00714h_0012.gif</url></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00714</href></item></canonical><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00714/20180315/images/medium/jp-2018-00714h_0012.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00714&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Early diagnosis is critical for individuals with Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) in clinical practice because its progress is irreversible. In the existing literature, support vector machine (SVM) has always been applied to distinguish between AD and healthy controls (HC) based on neuroimaging data. But previous studies have only used a single SVM to classify AD and HC, and the accuracy is not very high and generally less than 90%. The method of random support vector machine cluster was proposed to classify AD and HC in this paper. From the Alzheimer&apos;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the subjects including 25 AD individuals and 35 HC individuals were obtained. The classification accuracy could reach to 94.44% in the results. Furthermore, the method could also be used for feature selection and the accuracy could be maintained at the level of 94.44%.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is a thrombotic microangiopathy arising from consumption of both coagulation factors and platelets. DIC is triggered by a number of clinical conditions including severe infection, trauma and obstetric complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition is paramount. A high clinical index of suspicion is needed to ensure that patients at risk of developing DIC are appropriately investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In order to establish the clinical conditions most frequently associated with DIC, we reviewed all DIC screens received at a tertiary hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa over a 1 year period.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The commonest clinical condition associated with DIC in our population was infection with 84% of patients infected with an identified pathogen. The most frequently diagnosed pathogen was HIV followed by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; and other bacterial infections. In the majority of cases, bacteria were isolated from blood cultures. In 47 patients, HIV was the only pathogen which could be isolated. A relative risk ratio of 2.73 and an odds ratio of 29.97 was attributed to HIV for development of a DIC. A malignancy was present in 51 of the patients of which approximately 60% had co-existing infection. No cause could be attributed in 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Infection was identified in the majority of the patients diagnosed with DIC in this study. HIV showed the highest relative risk ratio of all pathogens although previous studies have not suggested that HIV was strongly associated with DIC. In almost half of the HIV infected patients, there was no other pathogen isolated despite extensive investigation. This suggests that HIV has a strong association with the development of DIC, warranting further research into the relationship between HIV and disseminated microvascular thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Elizabeth S.

This suggests that HIV has a strong association with the development of DIC, warranting further research into the relationship between HIV and disseminated microvascular thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523566800000</published><title>Pathogenic factors associated with development of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) in a tertiary academic hospital in South Africa</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2725.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2725.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2725.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is a laminated brain region in which neurogenesis begins during early embryonic development and continues until adulthood.

On a daily basis, planktonic organisms migrate vertically and thus experience widely varying conditions in their physico-chemical environment. In the Gulf of Finland, these changes are larger than values predicted by climate change scenarios predicted for the next century (up to 0.5 units in pH and 5°C in temperature). In this work, we are interested in how temporal variations in physico-chemical characteristics of the water column on a daily and weekly scale influence oxidative stress level and antioxidant responses in the planktonic copepod of the genus &lt;i&gt;Acartia&lt;/i&gt;. Responses were determined from samples collected during a two-week field survey in the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Our results showed that GST (Glutathione-S-transferase) enzyme activity increased in the surface waters between Weeks I and II, indicating antioxidant defense mechanism activation. This is most likely due to elevating temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen observed between these two weeks. During Week II also GSSG (oxidized glutathione) was detected, indicating that copepods responded to stressor(s) in the environment. Our results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Acartia&lt;/i&gt; copepods seem fairly tolerant to weekly fluctuations in environmental conditions in coastal and estuarine areas, in terms of antioxidant defense and oxidative stress. This could be directly connected to a very efficient glutathione cycling system acting as antioxidant defense system for neutralizing ROS and avoiding elevated levels of LPX.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Olivier Glippa</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179363e:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>6e289a4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Olivier Glippa, Jonna Engström-Öst, Mirella Kanerva, Anni Rein, Kristiina Vuori&lt;/p&gt;

In this work, we are interested in how temporal variations in physico-chemical characteristics of the water column on a daily and weekly scale influence oxidative stress level and antioxidant responses in the planktonic copepod of the genus &lt;i&gt;Acartia&lt;/i&gt;. Responses were determined from samples collected during a two-week field survey in the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Our results showed that GST (Glutathione-S-transferase) enzyme activity increased in the surface waters between Weeks I and II, indicating antioxidant defense mechanism activation. This is most likely due to elevating temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen observed between these two weeks. During Week II also GSSG (oxidized glutathione) was detected, indicating that copepods responded to stressor(s) in the environment. Our results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Acartia&lt;/i&gt; copepods seem fairly tolerant to weekly fluctuations in environmental conditions in coastal and estuarine areas, in terms of antioxidant defense and oxidative stress. This could be directly connected to a very efficient glutathione cycling system acting as antioxidant defense system for neutralizing ROS and avoiding elevated levels of LPX.</description><published>1523653200000</published><title>Oxidative stress and antioxidant defense responses in &amp;lt;i&gt;Acartia&amp;lt;/i&gt; copepods in relation to environmental factors</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lusha Wei, Tongjing Yan, Yifei Wu, Hui Chen, Baoshan Zhang&lt;/p&gt;
As predominant components of hemicelluloses in grasses, methylglucuroarabinoxylans (MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are sources for the production of acidic xylooligosaccharides (U-XOS). &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; MR44, an engineered biocatalyst to secrete only the XynC xylanase and Axh43 arabinoxylan hydrolase is capable of processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to exclusively U-XOS. The present studies are directed at the explosion on direct alkaline extraction serving for production of U-XOS. Response Surface Methodology was used to optimize xylan extraction conditions on the sweet sorghum bagasse to achieve maximum hemicelluloses yield. The optimized condition was as follows: extraction time of 3.91 h, extraction temperature of 86.1°C, and NaOH concentration (w/w) of 12.33%. Crude xylan extracted with NaOH revealed a compositional analysis of xylose (79.0%), arabinose (5.3%), glucose (1.7%), lignin and ash (5.6%). After neutralization this xylan preparation supported growth of MR44, processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; from sweet sorghum and accumulating U-XOS. The quality of U-XOS produced by MR44 using alkaline-treated sweet sorghum bagasse was comparable to that obtained from purified MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

British &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; complex [&lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato) mosquito distribution, abundance, and potential for disease transmission are intimately linked to their environment. Pond and lake dyes that block light to restrict algal photosynthesis are a relatively new product assumed to be an environmentally friendly since they are based on food dyes. Their use in urban garden ponds raises questions linked to mosquito oviposition, since coloured water can be an attractant. &lt;i&gt;Culex (&lt;/i&gt;mostly &lt;i&gt;pipiens)&lt;/i&gt; is commonly found in UK gardens and is a potential vector of viruses including the West Nile Virus (WNV). Any factors that significantly change the distribution and population of &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; could impact future risks of disease transmission. A gravid trap was used to catch female &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes for use in oviposition choice tests in laboratory and semi-field conditions. Two types of pond dye, blue and shadow (which looks slightly red), were tested for their impact on oviposition and survival of wild caught &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt;. There were no significant differences in the number of egg batches laid when gravid mosquitoes were given a choice between either blue dye and clear water or shadow dye and clear water indicating that these dyes are not attractants. Larvae hatched from egg batches laid by wild-caught gravid females were used to measure survival to adulthood with or without dye, in a habitat controlled to prevent further colonisation. The experiment was run twice, once in the summer and again in the autumn, whereas the dyes had no impact on emergence in the summer, there were highly significant reductions in emergence of adults in both dye treated habitats in the autumn. Containers with or without shadow dye were placed outside to colonise naturally and were sampled weekly for larvae and pupae over a 6 month period through summer and autumn. There was a significant negative effect of shadow dye on pupal abundance in a three week period over the summer, but otherwise there was no effect. It is likely that population abundance and food was a more powerful factor for mosquito survival than the dye.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Natali Ortiz-Perea</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2804:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>38533848</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Natali Ortiz-Perea, Rebecca Gander, Oliver Abbey, Amanda Callaghan&lt;/p&gt;
British &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; complex [&lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato) mosquito distribution, abundance, and potential for disease transmission are intimately linked to their environment. Pond and lake dyes that block light to restrict algal photosynthesis are a relatively new product assumed to be an environmentally friendly since they are based on food dyes. Their use in urban garden ponds raises questions linked to mosquito oviposition, since coloured water can be an attractant. &lt;i&gt;Culex (&lt;/i&gt;mostly &lt;i&gt;pipiens)&lt;/i&gt; is commonly found in UK gardens and is a potential vector of viruses including the West Nile Virus (WNV). Any factors that significantly change the distribution and population of &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; could impact future risks of disease transmission. A gravid trap was used to catch female &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes for use in oviposition choice tests in laboratory and semi-field conditions. Two types of pond dye, blue and shadow (which looks slightly red), were tested for their impact on oviposition and survival of wild caught &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt;. There were no significant differences in the number of egg batches laid when gravid mosquitoes were given a choice between either blue dye and clear water or shadow dye and clear water indicating that these dyes are not attractants. Larvae hatched from egg batches laid by wild-caught gravid females were used to measure survival to adulthood with or without dye, in a habitat controlled to prevent further colonisation. The experiment was run twice, once in the summer and again in the autumn, whereas the dyes had no impact on emergence in the summer, there were highly significant reductions in emergence of adults in both dye treated habitats in the autumn. Containers with or without shadow dye were placed outside to colonise naturally and were sampled weekly for larvae and pupae over a 6 month period through summer and autumn. There was a significant negative effect of shadow dye on pupal abundance in a three week period over the summer, but otherwise there was no effect. It is likely that population abundance and food was a more powerful factor for mosquito survival than the dye.</description><published>1522270800000</published><title>The effect of pond dyes on oviposition and survival in wild UK &amp;lt;i&gt;Culex&amp;lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194121</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194121</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194121</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kandace M.

Mimicry can occur in several contexts, including sexual interactions. In some cases, males mimic females to gain access to potential mates. In contrast, there are relatively few examples of species where females mimic males, and we know very little about what drives these patterns. Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain female mimicry of males. The first is that mimicry is used to reduce harassment of females by males. The second is that mimicry is used to display dominance over other females. In this study, we tested these hypotheses in &lt;i&gt;Brachyrhaphis&lt;/i&gt; fishes, wherein females of several species have pigmentation on their anal fin of the same coloration and shape, and in the same location, as the genitalia of males. To test if female mimicry of males reduces male harassment, we experimentally manipulated female pigmentation and observed male preference for females with and without male-like pigmentation. To test the effect that female mimicry of males has on female dominance, we observed how females respond to anal fin pigmentation patterns of companion females. We found that neither of these hypotheses was supported by our data. We conclude that similarities in anal fin pigmentation between male and female &lt;i&gt;Brachyrhaphis&lt;/i&gt; fishes is not an adaptation to reduce male harassment or to signal dominance between females. Alternative explanations must exist, including the possibility that these similarities are simply non-adaptive.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Kandace M.

Vocal development is usually studied from the perspective of neuroscience. In this issue, Zhang and Ghazanfar propose a way in which body growth might condition the process. They study the vocalizations of marmoset infants with a wide range of techniques that include computational models and experiments that mimic growth reversal. Their results suggest that the qualitative changes that occur during development are rooted in the nonlinear interaction between the nervous system and the biomechanics involved in respiration. This work illustrates how an integrative approach enriches our understanding of behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zvNFkUWyj-M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005544</href></item></canonical><engagement>6</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005544</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1624ed044f7:554aee:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521740694775</crawled><fingerprint>28edc485</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel B.

Previous research has linked the use of certain emotion regulation strategies to the vicarious experience of personal distress (PD) and empathic concern (EC). However, it has not yet been tested whether (1) vicarious PD is positively associated with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, (2) vicarious EC is positively associated with adaptive emotion regulation strategies or whether (3) PD and EC mediate the link between emotion regulation and reports of approach/avoidance in response to a person in distress. To that end, we assessed people’s reports of PD (i.e., anxious, troubled and upset) and EC (i.e., concerned, sympathetic and soft-hearted) in response to a video depicting a person in a threatening situation (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 78). Afterwards, we assessed participants’ reports of avoidance and approach with regard to the character and their disposition to use maladaptive and adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Results showed that both PD and EC were positively related to maladaptive strategies and negatively related to adaptive strategies, and that the association between maladaptive regulation strategies (i.e., rumination) and the willingness to avoid the person in distress was mediated by reports of greater PD. This study thus expands previous evidence on the relationship between maladaptive regulation strategies and affective empathy and provides novel insights into the main role that PD plays in the association between maladaptive strategies and social avoidance.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Delphine Grynberg</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194248</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087e0:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><fingerprint>a37b37d3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Delphine Grynberg, Belén López-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;

The PgdS enzyme is a poly-γ-glutamic (γ-PGA) hydrolase, which has potential application for a controllable degradation of γ-PGA by enzymatic depolymerization; however, the structure of PgdS is still unknown. Here, to study in detail the full-length PgdS structure, we analyze the low-resolution architecture of PgdS hydrolase from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; in solution using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) method. Combining with other methods, like dynamic light scattering and mutagenesis analyses, a model for the full length structure and the possible substrate delivery route of PgdS are proposed. The results will provide useful hints for future investigations into the mechanisms of γ-PGA degradation by the PgdS hydrolase and may provide valuable practical information.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Jumei Zeng</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195355</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76937:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>232224db</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jumei Zeng, Yun Jin, Zhongchuan Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Injuries are very common and can occur at any point of time in a day. Unintended injuries in kindergarten children are the most common and need immediate life saving care which is known as first aid. This study aimed to investigate knowledge, attitude, practice, and associated factors of first aid among kindergarten teachers of Lideta sub-city Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study was conducted among kindergarten teachers. Data was collected using pretested, structured and self-administered questionnaire S1 File. The collected data was entered in to Epi Data version 3.1 software and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify association between kindergarten teachers’ knowledge and attitudes towards first aid and different variables. Odds ratios with 95% CI and p&amp;lt;0.05 were computed to determine the presence of the association.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;One hundred and ninety-four teachers participated in the study with a response rate of 95%. Only 40% of the teachers were knowledgeable and 75% of them had positive attitude for first aid. Eighty percent of teachers encountered with children in need of first aid. Kindergarten teachers older than 35 years [AOR = 4.2, 95%CI: (1.02, 16.9)], five years’ experience [AOR = 3.1, 95%CI: (1.2, 7.6)], having previous first aid training [AOR = 3.1, 95%CI: (1.2, 7.7)], source of first aid information and teachers serving in private kindergarten are associated with having knowledge of first aid. Long time experience, type of kindergarten, previous training, and exposure to children in need of first aid were positive association with attitude towards first aid.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Low first aid knowledge and high positive attitude among kindergarten teachers. Having long time experience, being older age, previous first aid training, and serving in private kindergarten were positively associated with first aid knowledge and positive attitude.

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common disease of cattle and wildlife, with economic repercussions and implications for animal and human health. The surveillance of bTB in wildlife is particularly important, to shed light on the epidemiological role of wild species and for the adaptation of control measures. In France, a bTB surveillance system for free-ranging wildlife, the Sylvatub system, was launched in 2011 on wild boars, red deer, roe deer and badgers. It relies on active and passive surveillance activities, constrained by practical difficulties, such as the accessibility of wild animals, and regulatory rules for the trapping of badgers, for example. We report here the first assessment of stakeholders’ perceptions of the Sylvatub system and its acceptability, based on 20 individual semi-structured interviews with three types of stakeholder (collectors, coordinators, officers) in areas with different rates of bTB infection. With the caveat that these findings cannot be assumed to be representative of the national situation, we found that the Sylvatub system was considered useful by all the stakeholders interviewed. Those from the world of hunting participate in surveillance mostly to help livestock farmers, who are not systematically involved in bTB surveillance in wildlife. Many practical and regulatory constraints were raised, which could be offset by recognition of the work done by the “hunting community”, to maintain the willingness of these individuals to participate. We also identified a need for improvements in communication and information. Qualitative information, such as that collected here, is essential to improve our understanding of the reasons favoring and disfavoring participation in surveillance, and should be taken into account in the evaluation process. These results are relevant to hunters and to veterinary authorities wishing to identify the determinants of participation in the Sylvatub system. They could provide support for decision-making processes to improve surveillance strategies.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Julie Rivière</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194447</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a621:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>759063fa</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julie Rivière, Yann Le Strat, Pascal Hendrikx, Barbara Dufour&lt;/p&gt;

Sorghum (&lt;i&gt;Sorghum bicolor&lt;/i&gt;) extract is traditionally used as red biocolorant in West Africa to colour foods, among which &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt;, a soft cheese. This biocolorant is a source of the phytoalexin apigeninidin and phenolic acids, and users claim that it has preservative effects next to its colouring properties. If such a claim can be scientifically substantiated, it adds a valuable functional property to this natural red colorant, thereby increasing its potential applications in the food industry. Hence, the present study evaluated the antimicrobial properties of dye sorghum extracts using challenge tests in broth and &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt; as a model of a popular food application. The alkaline extract and hot aqueous extract were used for dyeing &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt; by 87.7% and 12.3% of the traders, respectively. The dyeing procedure is perceived as a preservation strategy, and is also a means to maximise the revenues. However, results demonstrated that the application of sorghum biocolorant on &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt; had no inhibitory effect on the growth of fungi (&lt;i&gt;Penicillium chrysogenum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cladosporium macrocarpum&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7. Furthermore, sorghum biocolorant in broth had no effect on growth of &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7. Consequently, the commonly used extracts for colouring soft West-African cheese did not show a preservative effect. In addition, dyeing did not affect the physico-chemical properties of &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt;. Still, the red colour hampered visual detection of microbial growth, thus clarifying the preservative effect reported by users.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Folachodé U.

Sinkholes are a well-known geologic hazard but their past occurrence, useful for subsidence risk prediction, is difficult to define, especially for ancient historic times. Consequently, our knowledge about Holocene carbonate landscapes is often limited. A multidisciplinary study of Trieste Karst (Italy), close to early Roman military fortifications, led to the identification of possible ancient road tracks, cut by at least one sinkhole. Electrical Resistivity Tomography through the sinkhole has suggested the presence of a cave below its bottom, possibly responsible of the sinkhole formation, while Ground Penetrating Radar has detected no tectonic disturbances underneath the tracks. Additionally, archaeological surveys led to the discovery of over 200 Roman shoe hobnails within or close to the investigated route. According to these data, the tracks are interpreted as the remains of a main Roman road, whose itinerary has been reconstructed for more than 4 km together with other elements of ancient landscape. Our results provide the first known evidence of a Roman main road swallowed by sinkholes and suggest that Holocene karst landscapes could be much different from what previously believed. In fact, sinkholes visible nowadays in the investigated region could have been flat areas filled by sediments up to the Roman time.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Federico Bernardini</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194939</canonicalUrl><engagement>41</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162592da6fd:4e7f8f8:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521914586877</crawled><fingerprint>9df99bf0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Bernardini, Giacomo Vinci, Emanuele Forte, Stefano Furlani, Michele Pipan, Sara Biolchi, Angelo De Min, Andrea Fragiacomo, Roberto Micheli, Paola Ventura, Claudio Tuniz&lt;/p&gt;

Despite its public availability, a majority of this data remains hard to query to the research community due to a lack of efficient data representation and indexing solutions. One of the available techniques to represent read data is a condensed form as an assembly graph. Such a representation contains all sequence information but does not store contextual information and metadata. We present two new approaches for a compressed representation of a graph coloring: a lossless compression scheme based on a novel application of wavelet tries as well as a highly accurate lossy compression based on a set of Bloom filters. Both strategies retain a coloring with dynamically changing graph topology. We present construction and merge procedures for both methods and evaluate their performance on a wide range of different datasets. By dropping the requirement of a fully lossless compression and using the topological information of the underlying graph, we can reduce memory requirements by up to three orders of magnitude. Representing individual colors as independently stored modules, our approaches are fully dynamic and can be efficiently parallelized.

Despite its public availability, a majority of this data remains hard to query to the research community due to a lack of efficient data representation and indexing solutions. One of the available techniques to represent read data is a condensed form as an assembly graph. Such a representation contains all sequence information but does not store contextual information and metadata. We present two new approaches for a compressed representation of a graph coloring: a lossless compression scheme based on a novel application of wavelet tries as well as a highly accurate lossy compression based on a set of Bloom filters. Both strategies retain a coloring with dynamically changing graph topology. We present construction and merge procedures for both methods and evaluate their performance on a wide range of different datasets.

Background &lt;p&gt;Aluminum phosphide (AlP) is used as pesticide in some countries for protection of stored grains. Human poisoning with AlP due to suicide attempt or accidental environmental exposure is associated with very high mortality partially due to development of severe metabolic acidosis. Previous studies have shown that hemoglobin has high buffering capacity and erythrocytes can potentially be used for management of metabolic acidosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fresh packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion on survival and cardiovascular function in AlP-poisoned rats.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Rats were poisoned with AlP by gavage. Fresh packed RBC was transfused via tail vein after AlP administration. Acid-base balance, vital signs and mortality was assessed and compared in experimental groups. Infusion of fresh packed RBC (1.5 ml) one hour after AlP (4–15 mg/kg) intoxication was associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate. Packed RBC infusion improved blood pH, HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. Plasma troponin level was also reduced and ECG changes were reversed following packed RBC infusion in AlP intoxicated rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our results showed that fresh RBC transfusion could ameliorate metabolic acidosis and enhance survival in AlP-poisoned rat.

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of underweight and overweight or obesity and their socio-demographic and lifestyle factors in a female adult population in Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;In a national cross-sectional population-based survey in the 2015–16 Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey, 12,160 women aged 18–49 years and not currently pregnant completed questionnaires and anthropometric measurements. Nutritional status was determined using Asian body mass index cut-offs: underweight (BMI&amp;lt;18.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), overweight (23.0–27.4 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and obesity (≥27.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Multinomial logistic regression modelling was used to determine the association between socio-demographic and lifestyle factors and weight status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of underweight was 14.1%, overweight 28.1% and obesity 13.1%. Among different age groups, the prevalence of underweight was the highest among 18 to 29 year-olds (20.2%), while overweight or obesity was the highest in the age group 30 to 49 years (around 50%). In multinomial logistic regression, being 30 to 49 years old, poorer and richer wealth status, living in all the other regions of Myanmar and ever contraceptive use were inversely and current tobacco use, not working and having less than two children ever born were positively associated with underweight relative to normal weight. Older age, having secondary education, urban residence, wealthier economic status, living with a partner, living in the Northern and Southern regions of Myanmar, having less than two children ever born and having ever used contraceptives were positively and current tobacco use was negatively associated with overweight or obesity relative to normal weight.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A dual burden of both underweight and overweight or obesity among female adults was found in Myanmar.

Aim &lt;p&gt;Warfarin is a cornerstone for the prevention of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation (AF), and several efforts have been taken to increase its usage and safety, including risk stratification schemes. Our aim was to investigate the temporal trends in initiation of warfarin and its effects on incidence of bleeding and thromboembolism in patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation 1996–2011.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;All patients with a first-time diagnosis of non-valvular atrial fibrillation were identified from nationwide administrative registries. Trends were determined by linear regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total 153,682 patients were included. Initiation of warfarin increased from 14% to 41% (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Events of thromboembolism decreased from 3.9% to 2.6% annually (p&amp;lt;0.0001). The greatest decline in thromboembolic events was observed for patients with a CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;VASc score &gt;1, where the annual decline was -0.12% (95%CI: -0.161; -0.084)) for those treated with warfarin and -0.073% (95%CI: -0.116;-0.030)) for those not treated with warfarin.

During the same period, thromboembolic events declined by a third and bleeding increased by a fifth, suggesting a beneficial effect associated with higher warfarin use.

These features facilitate a wide range of hypothesis testing for researchers and make EREFinder an excellent tool to aid in estrogen-related research.</description><published>1521010800000</published><title>EREFinder: Genome-wide detection of estrogen response elements [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04442-4</originId><published>1523516400000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04442-4</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04442-4</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deadly tumours are often born of childhood mutations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly tumours are often born of childhood mutations, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04442-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04442-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Early chromosomal disruption can set the stage for kidney cancer decades later.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162baba357b:f5ba51:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523551188347</crawled><fingerprint>424b64e1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deadly tumours are often born of childhood mutations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly tumours are often born of childhood mutations, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04442-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04442-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Early chromosomal disruption can set the stage for kidney cancer decades later.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04442-4/d41586-018-04442-4_15631140.jpg</url></visual><title>Deadly tumours are often born of childhood mutations</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194456</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194456</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194456</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sigal Kfir, Raghavendra Basavaraja, Noa Wigoda, Shifra Ben-Dor, Irit Orr, Rina Meidan&lt;/p&gt;
To unveil novel global changes associated with corpus luteum (CL) maturation, we analyzed transcriptome data for the bovine CL on days 4 and 11, representing the developing vs. mature gland. Our analyses revealed 681 differentially expressed genes (363 and 318 on day 4 and 11, respectively), with ≥2 fold change and FDR of &amp;lt;5%. Different gene ontology (GO) categories were represented prominently in transcriptome data at these stages (e.g. days 4: cell cycle, chromosome, DNA metabolic process and replication and on day 11: immune response; lipid metabolic process and complement activation). Based on bioinformatic analyses, select genes expression in day 4 and 11 CL was validated with quantitative real-time PCR. Cell specific expression was also determined in enriched luteal endothelial and steroidogenic cells. Genes related to the angiogenic process such as &lt;i&gt;NOS3&lt;/i&gt;, which maintains dilated vessels and &lt;i&gt;MMP9&lt;/i&gt;, matrix degrading enzyme, were higher on day 4. Importantly, our data suggests day 11 CL acquire mechanisms to prevent blood vessel sprouting and promote their maturation by expressing &lt;i&gt;NOTCH4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JAG1&lt;/i&gt;, greatly enriched in luteal endothelial cells. Another endothelial specific gene, &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt;, was identified here in the CL for the first time. &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt; is an adhesion molecule enabling lymphocyte migration, its higher levels at mid cycle are expected to support the transmigration of immune cells into the CL at this stage. Together with steroidogenic genes, most of the genes regulating de-novo cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (e.g &lt;i&gt;HMGCS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HMGCR&lt;/i&gt;) and cholesterol uptake from plasma (&lt;i&gt;LDLR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOD&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) were upregulated in the mature CL. These findings provide new insight of the processes involved in CL maturation including blood vessel growth and stabilization, leucocyte transmigration as well as progesterone synthesis as the CL matures.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Sigal Kfir</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194456</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad281c:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>98bfe610</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sigal Kfir, Raghavendra Basavaraja, Noa Wigoda, Shifra Ben-Dor, Irit Orr, Rina Meidan&lt;/p&gt;

The recent discovery of two new species of kiwaid squat lobsters on hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean and in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean has prompted a re-analysis of Kiwaid biogeographical history. Using a larger alignment with more fossil calibrated nodes than previously, we consider the precise relationship between Kiwaidae, Chirostylidae and Eumunididae within Chirostyloidea (Decapoda: Anomura) to be still unresolved at present. Additionally, the placement of both new species within a new “&lt;i&gt;Bristly&lt;/i&gt;” clade along with the seep-associated &lt;i&gt;Kiwa puravida&lt;/i&gt; is most parsimoniously interpreted as supporting a vent origin for the family, rather than a seep-to-vent progression. Fossil-calibrated divergence analysis indicates an origin for the clade around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary in the eastern Pacific ~33–38 Ma, coincident with a lowering of bottom temperatures and increased ventilation in the Pacific deep sea. Likewise, the mid-Miocene (~10–16 Ma) rapid radiation of the new &lt;i&gt;Bristly&lt;/i&gt; clade also coincides with a similar cooling event in the tropical East Pacific. The distribution, diversity, tree topology and divergence timing of Kiwaidae in the East Pacific is most consistent with a pattern of extinctions, recolonisations and radiations along fast-spreading ridges in this region and may have been punctuated by large-scale fluctuations in deep-water ventilation and temperature during the Cenozoic; further affecting the viability of Kiwaidae populations along portions of mid-ocean ridge.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Christopher Nicolai Roterman</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194696</canonicalUrl><engagement>4</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849f4:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>4ae872f0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher Nicolai Roterman, Won-Kyung Lee, Xinming Liu, Rongcheng Lin, Xinzheng Li, Yong-Jin Won&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Azathioprine is a widely used immunosuppressive drug. Genetic polymorphisms and activity of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) have been associated with azathioprine efficacy and toxicity in several populations. We investigated whether these associations also exist for ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) patients, who receive azathioprine maintenance therapy after remission induction with cyclophosphamide.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;207 AAV patients treated with cyclophosphamide induction and azathioprine maintenance therapy were included and followed for 60 months. &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype and tertiles of TPMT activity were compared to relapse free survival and occurrence of adverse events, particularly leukopenia. Multivariable regression was performed to account for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In univariable analysis, relapse free survival was not significantly associated with &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype (P = 0.41) or TPMT activity (P = 0.07), although it tended to be longer in lower tertiles of TPMT activity. There was no significant association of TPMT genotype and activity with occurrence of any adverse event. In multiple regression, leukocyte counts at the end of cyclophosphamide induction were related to risk of leukopenia during azathioprine therapy [P&amp;lt;0.001; OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.43–0.68)] and risk of relapse during follow-up [P = 0.001; HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.07–1.29)] irrespective of TMPT genotype or activity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;TPMT genotype and activity were not independent predictors of relapse, and could not predict leukopenia or other adverse effects from azathioprine.

&lt;i&gt;Melilotus&lt;/i&gt; is an important genus of legume plants and an herbage with excellent nitrogen fixation; it can tolerate extreme environmental conditions and possesses important medicinal value.

The &lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L and &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K sequences were highly conserved, whereas the &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L-F and ITS sequences contained variable and parsimony-informative sites. In our analyses of the single and combined regions, we calculated the pairwise distance, haplotype and nucleotide diversity and gaps and then constructed phylogenetic trees to assess the genetic diversity, and our results revealed significant variations among the different accessions. The genetic distance values were between zero and nine, and based on the combined regions, the highest frequency value was approximately four. &lt;i&gt;Melilotus&lt;/i&gt; showed high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, particularly in the ITS sequences, with values of 0.86 and 0.0087, respectively.

Background &lt;p&gt;People who use a cochlear implant together with a contralateral hearing aid—so-called bimodal listeners—have poor localisation abilities and sounds are often not balanced in loudness across ears. In order to address the latter, a loudness balancing algorithm was created, which equalises the loudness growth functions for the two ears. The algorithm uses loudness models in order to continuously adjust the two signals to loudness targets. Previous tests demonstrated improved binaural balance, improved localisation, and better speech intelligibility in quiet for soft phonemes. In those studies, however, all stimuli were preprocessed so spontaneous head movements and individual head-related transfer functions were not taken into account. Furthermore, the hearing aid processing was linear.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;In the present study, we simplified the acoustical loudness model and implemented the algorithm in a real-time system. We tested bimodal listeners on speech perception and on sound localisation, both in normal loudness growth configuration and in a configuration with a modified loudness growth function. We also used linear and compressive hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The comparison between the original acoustical loudness model and the new simplified model showed loudness differences below 3% for almost all tested speech-like stimuli and levels.

In adult-acquired infection, HBV antigens are usually cleared, whereas in infancy-acquired infection, they persist. Individuals infected during infancy therefore represent the majority of patients chronically infected with HBV (CHB). A therapy that can promote viral antigen clearance in most CHB patients has not been developed and would represent a major health care advance and cost mitigator. Using an age-dependent mouse model of HBV clearance and persistence in conjunction with human blood and liver tissue, we studied mechanisms of viral clearance to identify new therapeutic targets.

In adult-acquired infection, HBV antigens are usually cleared, whereas in infancy-acquired infection, they persist. Individuals infected during infancy therefore represent the majority of patients chronically infected with HBV (CHB). A therapy that can promote viral antigen clearance in most CHB patients has not been developed and would represent a major health care advance and cost mitigator. Using an age-dependent mouse model of HBV clearance and persistence in conjunction with human blood and liver tissue, we studied mechanisms of viral clearance to identify new therapeutic targets. We demonstrate that age-dependent expression of the costimulatory molecule OX40 ligand (OX40L) by hepatic innate immune cells is pivotal in determining HBV immunity, and that treatment with OX40 agonists leads to improved HBV antigen clearance in young mice, as well as increased strength of T cell responses in young mice and adult mice that were exposed to HBV when they were young and developed a CHB serological profile.

In the context of an ageing population, understanding the transmission of infectious diseases such as scabies through well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases. Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random models to real data on scabies in residential care homes. In particular, we review and benchmark different numerical methods for the integration of the differential equation system, and then select the most appropriate of these methods to perform inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo.

In the context of an ageing population, understanding the transmission of infectious diseases such as scabies through well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases. Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random models to real data on scabies in residential care homes. In particular, we review and benchmark different numerical methods for the integration of the differential equation system, and then select the most appropriate of these methods to perform inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We test the goodness-of-fit of this model using posterior predictive intervals and propagate forward the resulting parameter uncertainty in a Bayesian framework to consider the economic cost of delayed interventions against scabies, quantifying the benefits of prompt action in the event of detection. We also revisit the previous methodology used to assess the safety of treatments in small population sub-units—in this context ivermectin—and demonstrate that even a very slight relaxation of the implicit assumption of homogeneous death rates significantly increases the plausibility of the hypothesis that ivermectin does not cause excess mortality based upon the data of Barkwell and Shields [1].&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UwFpGqUcNck&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1522095842894</recrawled><published>1522098000000</published><title>Scabies in residential care homes: Modelling, inference and interventions for well-connected population sub-units</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195826</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195826</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195826</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dong Hyun Ryu, Yong Hun Jung, Kyung Woon Jeung, Byung Kook Lee, Young Won Jeong, Jong Geun Yun, Dong Hun Lee, Sung Min Lee, Tag Heo, Yong Il Min&lt;/p&gt;
Unrecognized endobronchial intubation frequently occurs after emergency intubation. However, no study has evaluated the effect of one-lung ventilation on end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We compared the hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during one-lung ventilation with those during conventional two-lung ventilation in a pig model of CPR, to determine the effect of the former on ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A randomized crossover study was conducted in 12 pigs intubated with double-lumen endobronchial tube to achieve lung separation. During CPR, the animals underwent three 5-min ventilation trials based on a randomized crossover design: left-lung, right-lung, or two-lung ventilation. Arterial blood gases were measured at the end of each ventilation trial. Ventilation was provided using the same tidal volume throughout the ventilation trials. Comparison using generalized linear mixed model revealed no significant group effects with respect to aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and carotid blood flow; however, significant group effect in terms of ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In the post hoc analyses, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was lower during the right-lung ventilation than during the two-lung (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) or left-lung ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). However, no difference in ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was detected between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and oxygen saturation (SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) differed among the three types of ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, respectively). The post hoc analyses revealed a higher PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, lower PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and lower SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during right-lung ventilation than during two-lung or left-lung ventilation. However, the levels of these blood gases did not differ between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. In a pig model of CPR, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was significantly lower during right-lung ventilation than during two-lung ventilation.

The overall survival (OS) of patients with ovarian cancer is poor while epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinico-pathologic characteristics, especially the prognostic factors, for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in Taiwan. Information about newly diagnosed patients with EOC from 2009 to 2012 was retrieved from the database of the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Data from 2009 to 2013 for the respective cases from the claims database of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance and National Death Registry were then retrieved. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of the 2,498 patients was 52.8 years. Serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma were diagnosed in 43.3% and 22.8% of the total patients, respectively. For patients with early-stage disease, taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage I, and younger age at diagnosis led to better overall survival (p = 0.030, p = 0.002, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively) in multivariable analysis. For advanced-stage patients, histology (endometrioid type), taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage, and age at diagnosis had a significant impact on OS (p&amp;lt;0.001, p = 0.020, p&amp;lt;0.001, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In conclusion, taxane-based chemotherapy impacts the outcome of patients with EOC. Personalized medicine may be needed for different histological types of EOC because of their different outcomes.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Lin-Chau Chang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194993</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626374dad7:5af0aea:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><fingerprint>9df5e11f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lin-Chau Chang, Chih-Fen Huang, Mei-Shu Lai, Li-Jiuan Shen, Fe-Lin Lin Wu, Wen-Fang Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

Elucidation of the neural correlates of time perception constitutes an important research topic in cognitive neuroscience. The focus to date has been on durations in the millisecond to seconds range, but here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine brain functional connectivity during much longer durations (i.e., 15 min). For this purpose, we conducted an initial exploratory experiment followed by a confirmatory experiment. Our results showed that those participants who overestimated time exhibited lower activity of beta (18–30 Hz) at several electrode sites. Furthermore, graph theoretical analysis indicated significant differences in the beta range (15–30 Hz) between those that overestimated and underestimated time. Participants who underestimated time showed higher clustering coefficient compared to those that overestimated time. We discuss our results in terms of two aspects. FFT results, as a linear approach, are discussed within localized/dedicated models (i.e., scalar timing model). Second, non-localized properties of psychological interval timing (as emphasized by intrinsic models) are addressed and discussed based on results derived from graph theory. Results suggested that although beta amplitude in central regions (related to activity of BG-thalamocortical pathway as a dedicated module) is important in relation to timing mechanisms, the properties of functional activity of brain networks; such as the segregation of beta network, are also crucial for time perception. These results may suggest subjective time may be created by vector units instead of scalar ticks.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Amir Hossein Ghaderi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195380</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd076:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>ba2774aa</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amir Hossein Ghaderi, Shadi Moradkhani, Arvin Haghighatfard, Fatemeh Akrami, Zahra Khayyer, Fuat Balcı&lt;/p&gt;

We found that GDV1 targeted heterochromatin and triggered HP1 eviction, thus derepressing &lt;i&gt;ap2-g&lt;/i&gt;. Expression of GDV1 was responsive to environmental triggers of sexual conversion and controlled via a &lt;i&gt;gdv1&lt;/i&gt; antisense RNA. Hence, GDV1 appears to act as an effector protein that induces sexual differentiation by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521135592000</published><title>GDV1 induces sexual commitment of malaria parasites by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195786</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195786</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195786</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mariáurea Matias Sarandy, Lyvia Lopes Miranda, Luciana Schulthais Altoé, Rômulo Dias Novaes, Virgínia Vinha Zanuncio, João Paulo Viana Leite, Reggiani Vilela Gonçalves&lt;/p&gt;
Natural substances are used in folk medicines to treat injuries. &lt;i&gt;Strychnos pseudoquina&lt;/i&gt; has scarring, antipyretic, and antimalarial actions. The present study aimed to analyze the effect of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudoquina&lt;/i&gt; on cutaneous wound healing in rats. The &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudoquina&lt;/i&gt; extract was submitted to phytochemical prospection. The levels of flavonoids and total phenolic compounds in the extract were 50.7 mg/g and 2.59 mg/g, respectively. Thirty Wistar rats were individualized in cages with food and water &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; (registration no. 730/2014). After anesthesia, three circular wounds (12mm diameter) were made in the animals, which were randomly separated into five treatments: Sal, saline; VO, ointment vehicles (lanolin and Vaseline); SS, positive control (silver sulfadiazine 1%); LE 5, freeze-dried extract 5%; and LE 10, lyophilized extract 10%. The animals were treated with the ointment daily for 21 days. Every seven days, the area and the rate of wound contraction were evaluated. Tissue samples were removed for histopathological analysis of the number of mast cells, elastic and collagen fibers, and biochemical analyses, quantification of malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonylated proteins (PCN), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), Interleukin 10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The number of mast cells, collagen and elastic fibers in the rat wounds were higher in the treatments with the plant. The extract also stimulated the activity of antioxidant enzymes, particularly SOD, presenting high levels, and maintained low levels of PCN. The TGF-β and IL-10 concentration was higher in the LE5 and LE10 treatment of the extract than in the Sal, OV and SS treatments on day 7.

Evidence from literature is mixed regarding a possible association of maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and overweight in the offspring. Sexual dimorphism, or sex disparities in the pathogenesis linking GDM exposure to overweight, could be at play. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between GDM and child overweight at 5–7 years. Six hundred pairs (1:1) of Reunionese liveborn singletons selected from a hospital-based birth registry, matched for sex, gestational age, and birth period, underwent a prospective in-home follow-up and were analyzed with respect to their exposure to GDM. The primary outcome was child overweight at 5–7 years, as defined by the International Obesity Task Force. The association between GDM exposure and child overweight was estimated by the odds ratio (OR) using conditional logistic regression models. For the subset of children exposed to GDM with available maternal glycemic data, we analyzed the relationship between maternal glycemic levels during pregnancy and child body mass index (BMI) at 5–7 years with a linear regression model. In light of the significant interaction between sex and GDM, all statistical analyses were then stratified by sex. After controlling for pre-pregnancy BMI and maternal sociodemographic characteristics, the risk of overweight increased with exposure to GDM for boys (adjusted OR: 2.34; 95% confidence interval = 1.26–4.34, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) but not for girls (adjusted OR: 0.56; 95%CI = 0.28–1.10, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.093). Consistent with this, the linear increase of boys’ BMI at 5–7 years with maternal blood glucose levels during pregnancy, in the exposed group, displayed a dose-response relationship. Our findings indicate that exposure to GDM is a risk factor for childhood overweight in boys but not in girls, which adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting greater sensitivity of male offspring to intrauterine hyperglycemia.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Nathalie Le Moullec</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195531</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>5047ace4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathalie Le Moullec, Adrian Fianu, Olivier Maillard, Emilie Chazelle, Nadège Naty, Chantal Schneebeli, Patrick Gérardin, Laetitia Huiart, Marie-Aline Charles, François Favier&lt;/p&gt;

Gene regulation at the transcriptional level is a central process in all organisms, and DNA-binding transcription factors, known as TFs, play a fundamental role. This class of proteins usually binds at specific DNA sequences, activating or repressing gene expression. In general, TFs are composed of two domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an extra domain, which in this work we have named “companion domain” (CD). This latter could be involved in one or more functions such as ligand binding, protein-protein interactions or even with enzymatic activity. In contrast to DBDs, which have been widely characterized both experimentally and bioinformatically, information on the abundance, distribution, variability and possible role of the CDs is scarce. Here, we investigated these issues associated with the domain architectures of TFs in prokaryotic genomes. To this end, 19 families of TFs in 761 non-redundant bacterial and archaeal genomes were evaluated. In this regard we found four main groups based on the abundance and distribution in the analyzed genomes: i) LysR and TetR/AcrR; ii) AraC/XylS, SinR, and others; iii) Lrp, Fis, ArsR, and others; and iv) a group that included only two families, ArgR and BirA. Based on a classification of the organisms according to the life-styles, a major abundance of regulatory families in free-living organisms, in contrast with pathogenic, extremophilic or intracellular organisms, was identified. Finally, the protein architecture diversity associated to the 19 families considering a weight score for domain promiscuity evidenced which regulatory families were characterized by either a large diversity of CDs, here named as “promiscuous” families given the elevated number of variable domains found in those TFs, or a low diversity of CDs. Altogether this information helped us to understand the diversity and distribution of the 19 Prokaryotes TF families. Moreover, initial steps were taken to comprehend the variability of the extra domain in those TFs, which eventually might assist in evolutionary and functional studies.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Ernesto Perez-Rueda</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195332</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f68:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>993d9672</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto Perez-Rueda, Rafael Hernandez-Guerrero, Mario Alberto Martinez-Nuñez, Dagoberto Armenta-Medina, Israel Sanchez, J.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) plays an essential role in gluconeogenesis. Here we report that the human FBP1 gene is regulated by two liver-enriched transcription factors, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. C/EBPα regulates transcription of FBP1 gene via binding to the two overlapping C/EBPα sites located at nucleotide -228/-208 while HNF4α regulates FBP1 gene through binding to the classical H4-SBM site and direct repeat 3 (DR3) located at nucleotides -566/-554 and -212/-198, respectively. Mutations of these transcription factor binding sites result in marked decrease of C/EBPα- or HNF4α-mediated transcription activation of FBP1 promoter-luciferase reporter expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of -228/-208 C/EBPα or -566/-554 and -212/-198 HNF4α sites with nuclear extract of HepG2 cells overexpressing C/EBPα or HNF4α confirms binding of these two transcription factors to these sites. Finally, we showed that siRNA-mediated suppression of C/EBPα or HNF4α expression in HepG2 cells lowers expression of FBP1 in parallel with down-regulation of expression of other gluconeogenic enzymes. Our results suggest that an overall gluconeogenic program is regulated by these two transcription factors, enabling transcription to occur in a liver-specific manner.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Siriluck Wattanavanitchakorn</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194252</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123916:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>163651e1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siriluck Wattanavanitchakorn, Pinnara Rojvirat, Tanit Chavalit, Michael J.

Our results suggest that an overall gluconeogenic program is regulated by these two transcription factors, enabling transcription to occur in a liver-specific manner.</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) regulate expression of the human fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5012926?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5012926?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5012926?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/11&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 11&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1521438067000</published><author><name>Yangfan Shao</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1625704c351:4c87b82:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521878352721</crawled><fingerprint>896f8f40</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Fullerene/layered antiferromagnetic reconstructed spinterface: Subsurface layer dominates molecular orbitals’ spin-split and large induced magnetic moment</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194996</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194996</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194996</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chi Phuong Nguyen, Eddy M.

Background &lt;p&gt;The incidence rate of breast cancer is increasing and has become the most common cancer in Vietnamese women while the survival rate is lower than that of developed countries. Early detection to improve breast cancer survival as well as reducing risk factors remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This study aims to evaluate the costs and outcomes of introducing a mammography screening program for Vietnamese women aged 45–64 years, compared to the current situation of no screening.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Decision analytical modeling using Markov chain analysis was used to estimate costs and health outcomes over a lifetime horizon. Model inputs were derived from published literature and the results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and/or incremental net monetary benefits (INMBs). One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The ICER per life year gained of the first round of mammography screening was US$3647.06 and US$4405.44 for women aged 50–54 years and 55–59 years, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, mammography screening in the 50–54 age group and the 55–59 age group were cost-effective in 100% of cases at a threshold of three times the Vietnamese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) i.e., US$6332.70. However, less than 50% of the cases in the 60–64 age group and 0% of the cases in the 45–49 age group were cost effective at the WHO threshold. The ICERs were sensitive to the discount rate, mammography sensitivity, and transition probability from remission to distant recurrence in stage II for all age groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;From the healthcare payer viewpoint, offering the first round of mammography screening to Vietnamese women aged 50–59 years should be considered, with the given threshold of three times the Vietnamese GDP per capita.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Chi Phuong Nguyen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194996</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626374dad7:5af0aeb:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><fingerprint>897ccedd</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chi Phuong Nguyen, Eddy M.

Virus-mediated expression of defined transcription factor (TF) genes can effectively induce cellular reprogramming. However, sustained expression of the TFs often hinders pluripotent stem cell (PSC) differentiation into specific cell types, as each TF exerts its effect on PSCs for a defined period of time during differentiation. Here, we applied a bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS)-based protein delivery tool to directly translocate TFs in the form of protein into human PSCs. This transient protein delivery technique showed high delivery efficiency for hPSCs, and it avoids potential genetic alterations caused by the introduction of transgenes. In an established cardiomyocyte &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; differentiation procedure, five transcriptional factors, namely GATA4, MEF2C, TBX5, ESRRG and MESP1 (abbreviated as GMTEM), were translocated at various time points. By detecting the expression of cardiac marker genes (&lt;i&gt;Nkx2&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cTnT&lt;/i&gt;), we found that GMTEM proteins delivered on mesoderm stage of the cardiomyocytes lineage differentiation significantly enhanced both the human ESC and iPSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes, while earlier or later delivery diminished the enhancing effect. Furthermore, all of the five factors were required to enhance the cardiac differentiation. This work provides a virus-free strategy of transient transcription factors delivery for directing human stem cell fate without jeopardizing genome integrity, thus safe for biomedical applications.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Yongxin Jin</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194895</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf604:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>aec240da</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yongxin Jin, Ying Liu, Zhenpeng Li, Katherine Santostefano, Jing Shi, Xinwen Zhang, Donghai Wu, Zhihui Cheng, Weihui Wu, Naohiro Terada, Shouguang Jin, Fang Bai&lt;/p&gt;

Ocular tuberculosis (TB) commonly causes severe inflammation and vision loss in TB-endemic countries. The mechanism by which tuberculous infection becomes established in the eye is poorly understood. We have developed the zebrafish larva infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium marinum&lt;/i&gt; as a model to study the early pathogenesis of ocular TB. We find that hematogenous bacterial seeding of the eye occurs despite a functional blood retinal barrier. Prototypical early granulomas form in response to bacteria in the eye.

Ocular tuberculosis (TB) commonly causes severe inflammation and vision loss in TB-endemic countries. The mechanism by which tuberculous infection becomes established in the eye is poorly understood. We have developed the zebrafish larva infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium marinum&lt;/i&gt; as a model to study the early pathogenesis of ocular TB. We find that hematogenous bacterial seeding of the eye occurs despite a functional blood retinal barrier. Prototypical early granulomas form in response to bacteria in the eye. These granulomas involve the retinal vasculature and retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex which are characteristic locations for human ocular TB. We find that peripheral blood monocytes are recruited to the nascent ocular granuloma further suggesting that the immune privileged nature of the eye is breached by this inflammatory focus.</description><published>1522184400000</published><title>A zebrafish model for ocular tuberculosis</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194190</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194190</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194190</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Karina Araujo Pinto, Rosane Harter Griep, Lucia Rotenberg, Maria da Conceição Chagas Almeida, Rosane Sousa Barreto, Estela M.

Perceived time constraints have been highlighted in sociological studies as representing a core issue in determining quality of life. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that gender inequalities regarding insufficiency of time play a role in the development of overweight and obesity in adults. The study used baseline data (2008–2010) from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), which monitors a cohort of 15,105 civil servants of 35 to 74 years of age. Insufficient time for personal care and leisure due to professional and domestic duties, as detailed in a structured questionnaire, comprised the main exposure variable. The outcome variable was overweight/obesity measured according to body mass index. Prevalence ratios were calculated using multinomial logistic regression. A greater proportion of women compared to men reported insufficient time for personal care and leisure (34.5% versus 23.8%, respectively). The prevalence of overweight was greater in men, while obesity was more common in women. Insufficient time for personal care and leisure was associated with overweight (PR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.04–1.61) and obesity (PR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.28–2.12) only in women working over 40 hours/week. No significant association was found for males. These results suggest that the length of the working week influences factors underlying weight gain, possibly issues linked to behavior and/or stress mechanisms. The fact that such an association was restricted to women suggests that the results originate from gender inequalities involving relationships between time and health. The findings of this study provide data on which to base public policies aimed at encouraging the redistribution of domestic responsibilities in the direction of gender equity, as well as macrosocial policies such as providing public schools for workers’ children.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Karina Araujo Pinto</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194190</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d5f:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>85f03dc5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karina Araujo Pinto, Rosane Harter Griep, Lucia Rotenberg, Maria da Conceição Chagas Almeida, Rosane Sousa Barreto, Estela M.

Understanding maternity roost requirements is fundamental to guide timber production forest management given such roosts are vital to sustain bat populations. We tracked lactating females of three tree cavity-roosting species: Gould&apos;s long-eared bat (&lt;i&gt;Nyctophilus gouldi&lt;/i&gt;) (n = 7), eastern broad-nosed bat (&lt;i&gt;Scotorepens orion&lt;/i&gt;) (n = 6) and little forest bat (&lt;i&gt;Vespadelus vulturnus&lt;/i&gt;) (n = 25), over five weeks in young (predominately &amp;lt;5years old) forest regenerating from heavy timber harvest in southeast Australia. We aimed to investigate interspecific maternity roost selection in a regenerating landscape and by doing so, increase our understanding of the three species’ roost ecology. Sixteen &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vulturnus&lt;/i&gt;, 15 &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gouldi&lt;/i&gt; and six &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;orion&lt;/i&gt; unique maternity roost trees were located. Bats displayed a degree of maternity roost selection plasticity, however, interspecific differences were found. &lt;i&gt;Nyctophilus gouldi&lt;/i&gt; roosted selectively in retained riparian buffers, in trees of high senescence and switched roosts every day. &lt;i&gt;Vespadelus vulturnus&lt;/i&gt; roosted in logged areas and displayed high roost site fidelity, with one roost used for 33 consecutive days. &lt;i&gt;Scotorepens orion&lt;/i&gt; selected large live trees of low senescence. The preliminary data for this species suggests that females roost most days in ‘primary’ roosts but display a roost switching behaviour conforming to the fission-fusion model. Dead trees were identified to be important for both &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gouldi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vulturnus&lt;/i&gt;. Historical and recent logging at our study area drastically reduced cavity-bearing tree density to 1.4 trees per hectare in the logging zones (outside of exclusion areas), potentially limiting local populations of tree cavity-roosting bats and other cavity-dependent wildlife. Our data demonstrate that forest management must consider a range of maternity roost requirements to accommodate differences among species and highlight the importance of exclusion areas for roost habitat. We propose that an expanded ‘retention forestry’ approach should be implemented in logged areas that includes in-perpetuity forest patch retention to increase habitat complexity and continuity.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Niels Rueegger</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194429</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a61e:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>38d9d976</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Niels Rueegger, Brad Law, Ross Goldingay&lt;/p&gt;

Biologists determine experimental effects by perturbing biological entities or units. When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity–intervention pair contributes to the sample size (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;) and forms the basis of statistical inference. If the wrong entity–intervention pair is chosen, an experiment cannot address the question of interest. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents and effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities provide clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22% of studies (95% CI = 17%–29%) replicated the correct entity–intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Nearly half of the studies (46%, 95% CI = 38%–53%) had pseudoreplication while 32% (95% CI = 26%–39%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, and thus the evidence for a scientific claim, resulting in false positives. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide concrete examples of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental designs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/h-ldp2fjUm4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005282</href></item></canonical><engagement>23</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005282</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16291bed3a0:b8480a:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522863625120</crawled><fingerprint>37283983</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stanley E.

Surprisingly, while rapid genomic profiling is becoming ubiquitous, the development of biomarkers almost always involves the application of bespoke techniques that cannot be directly applied to other datasets. There is an urgent need for a systematic methodology to create biologically-interpretable molecular models that robustly predict key phenotypes. We therefore created SIMMS: an algorithm that fragments pathways into functional modules and uses these to predict phenotypes. We applied SIMMS to multiple data-types across four diseases, and in each it reproducibly identified subtypes, made superior predictions to the best bespoke approaches, and identified known and novel signaling nodes.

Surprisingly, while rapid genomic profiling is becoming ubiquitous, the development of biomarkers almost always involves the application of bespoke techniques that cannot be directly applied to other datasets. There is an urgent need for a systematic methodology to create biologically-interpretable molecular models that robustly predict key phenotypes. We therefore created SIMMS: an algorithm that fragments pathways into functional modules and uses these to predict phenotypes. We applied SIMMS to multiple data-types across four diseases, and in each it reproducibly identified subtypes, made superior predictions to the best bespoke approaches, and identified known and novel signaling nodes. To demonstrate its ability on a new dataset, we measured 33 genes/nodes of the PIK3CA pathway in 1,734 FFPE breast tumours and created a four-subnetwork prediction model. This model significantly out-performed existing clinically-used molecular tests in an independent 1,742-patient validation cohort.

The co-existence of several ploidy types in natural populations makes the cyprinid loach &lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; an exciting model system to study the genetic and phenotypic consequences of ploidy variations. A first step in such effort is to identify the specific ploidy of an individual. Currently popular methods of karyotyping via cytological preparation or flow cytometry require a large amount of tissue (such as blood) samples, which can be damaging or fatal to the fishes. Here, we developed novel microsatellite markers (SSR markers) from &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; and show that they can effectively discriminate ploidy using samples collected in a minimally invasive way. Specifically, we generated whole genome transcriptomes from multiple &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; using the Illumina paired-end sequencing. Approximately 150 million raw reads were assembled into 76,544 non-redundant unigenes. A total of 8,194 potential SSR markers were identified. We selected 98 pairs with more than five tandem repeats for further assays. Out of 45 putative EST-SSR markers that successfully amplified and harbored polymorphism in diploids, 11 markers displayed high variability in tetraploids. We further demonstrate that a set of five EST-SSR markers selected from these are sufficient to distinguish ploidy levels, by first validating them on 69 reference specimens with known ploidy levels and then subsequently using fresh-collected 96 ploidy-unknown specimens. The results from EST-SSR markers are highly concordant with those from independent flow cytometry analysis. The novel EST-SSR markers developed here should facilitate genetic studies of polyploidy in the emerging model system &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Bing Feng</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195829</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d1:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>98eba322</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bing Feng, Soojin V.

This study aimed to explore the trend in population levels, as well as the correlates, of occupational and leisure sitting time in full-time employed Australian adults between 2007 and 2015. We used data from the 2007/08, 2011/12 and 2014/15 Australian Health Surveys, in which nationally representative samples of the Australian population were interviewed. Full-time (≥35 hours/week) employed respondents reported sitting time at work and during leisure on a usual workday. Trends over time and associations between socio-demographic and health-related characteristics and sitting time were analysed in the combined dataset using multivariable logistic regression models. Over 21,000 observations were included in the analyses. Across the three surveys, approximately 51% of the respondents reported ≥4 hours/workday occupational sitting time, 40% reported ≥4 hours/workday leisure sitting time, and 55% reported ≥7 hours/workday combined occupational and leisure sitting time. There were no clear trends over time. All potential correlates were associated with occupational sitting time and all but educational level were associated with leisure sitting time. The directions of the associations with gender, age and leisure-time physical activity were reversed for occupational sitting time and leisure sitting time. These findings show that the average levels of occupational and leisure sitting time on workdays were high but stable over the past decade. The observed differences in correlates of occupational and leisure sitting time demonstrate the need to assess and address sedentary behaviour domains separately in research and policy.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Anne Loyen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195177</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc713e:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>c248095f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anne Loyen, Tien Chey, Lina Engelen, Adrian Bauman, Jeroen Lakerveld, Hidde P. van der Ploeg, Johannes Brug, Josephine Y.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. Controversies still exist over the relationship between hyponatremia and outcomes of hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To analyze the association of low serum sodium levels at hospital admission with in-hospital mortality and patient disposition and to compare the distribution of the risk of death associated with hyponatremia across the lifespan of hospitalized patients, we conducted an observational study of 2.3 million patients using data extracted from the Cerner Health Facts database between 2000 and 2014. Logistic regression models were used in the analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At hospital admission 14.4% of hospitalized patients had serum sodium levels [Na] &amp;lt;135 mEq/L. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, we found that the risk of in-hospital mortality significantly increases for [Na] levels &amp;lt; 135 or ≥143 to ≤145 mEq/L compared to the reference interval of 140 to &amp;lt;143 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001). We observed similar trends for the relationship between [Na] levels and discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility. We demonstrated that younger age groups (18 to &amp;lt;45, 45 to &amp;lt;65) had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared to older age groups (65 to &amp;lt;75, ≥75) for [Na] levels &amp;lt;130 mEq/L or 143 to ≤145 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is common among hospitalized patients and is significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility.

Understanding the control of epigenetic regulation is key to explain and modify the aging process. Because histone-modifying enzymes are sensitive to shifts in availability of cofactors (e.g. metabolites), cellular epigenetic states may be tied to changing conditions associated with cofactor variability. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationships between cofactor fluctuations, epigenetic landscapes, and cell state transitions. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we generate an ensemble of epigenetic regulation (ER) systems whose heterogeneity reflects variability in cofactor pools used by histone modifiers. The heterogeneity of epigenetic metabolites, which operates as regulator of the kinetic parameters promoting/preventing histone modifications, stochastically drives phenotypic variability. The ensemble of ER configurations reveals the occurrence of distinct epi-states within the ensemble. Whereas resilient states maintain large epigenetic barriers refractory to reprogramming cellular identity, plastic states lower these barriers, and increase the sensitivity to reprogramming. Moreover, fine-tuning of cofactor levels redirects plastic epigenetic states to re-enter epigenetic resilience, and vice versa. Our ensemble model agrees with a model of metabolism-responsive loss of epigenetic resilience as a cellular aging mechanism. Our findings support the notion that cellular aging, and its reversal, might result from stochastic translation of metabolic inputs into resilient/plastic cell states via ER systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O1S3sVW-8ko&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006052</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006052</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1622ace2bc4:b9c550:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521136577476</crawled><fingerprint>f2ca599a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Núria Folguera-Blasco, Elisabet Cuyàs, Javier A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease of unknown etiology in which genetic factors contribute to development of disease. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in multidrug resistance 1 (&lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt;) gene encoding transporter P-glycoprotein have been associated with IBD, but their role in disease susceptibility remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of three &lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms, C1236T (rs1128503), G2677T/A (rs2032582) and C3435T (rs1045642), with Serbian IBD patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 206 IBD patients, 107 Crohn&apos;s disease (CD) and 99 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 255 healthy controls were included in the study. All subjects were genotyped using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Comparisons between the groups were performed using the Pearson Chi-square test. False discovery rate according to Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Carriers of T allele of all three &lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt; SNPs were more common in UC patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting predisposing role of T allele of these SNPs in UC pathogenesis. Consistently, TT genotype of C1236T and TTT haplotype were also found more frequently in UC patients. On the other hand, C allele and CC genotype of C1236T and C3435T, as well as G allele and GG genotype of G2677T/A were more frequent in healthy subjects, implying protective role of these variants in UC. Likewise, CGC haplotype and CGC/CGC diplotype were more frequent in controls. Contrary to UC, no statistical difference was observed between CD patients and controls in any of the SNPs analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt; gene variants and haplotypes were associated with UC in Serbian IBD patients, further supporting their potential role in susceptibility to UC.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Dragana Mijac</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194536</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a629:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>378bd393</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dragana Mijac, Irena Vukovic-Petrovic, Vera Mijac, Vladimir Perovic, Natasa Milic, Srdjan Djuranovic, Daniela Bojic, Dragan Popovic, Djordje Culafic, Miodrag Krstic, Goran Jankovic, Vera Pravica, Milos Markovic&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to conduct an indirect treatment comparison between cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel relative to comparators in the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who progress on docetaxel-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the network meta-analysis of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Due to a lack of head-to-head trials, studies with a comparator arm of best supportive care were included in the analysis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events were compared within both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks. The ratios for survival outcomes were estimated using hazard ratios (HR), and the ratios for adverse events between groups were estimated using odds ratios (ORs); uncertainty was reported as 95% confidence (Frequentist) and credible (Baysesian) Intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three of thirteen trials identified for abstraction were relevant for analyses. Median overall survival was not statistically significantly different for abiraterone (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.83–1.28) or enzalutamide (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.69–1.11) when compared to cabazitaxel in the Bayesian analysis. Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01–10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI = 1.41–75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03–10.09) were more likely to occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14–206.40). Frequentist analyses produced similar results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The scarcity of clinical studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles. As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the beneficial effects of these therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Jon P.

Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01–10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI = 1.41–75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03–10.09) were more likely to occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14–206.40). Frequentist analyses produced similar results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The scarcity of clinical studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles. As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the beneficial effects of these therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523480400000</published><title>Indirect treatment comparison of cabazitaxel for patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have been previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31414</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31414</link><crawled>1523612543857</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523577600000</published><author><name>avidal@ilstu.edu (Andres Vidal-Gadea)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31414</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162be626b71:14b0a95:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31414</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>50b89552</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><description>Many animals can orient using the earth’s magnetic field.

Aims &lt;p&gt;In the current study we investigated the effects of resisted sprint training on sprinting performance and underlying mechanical parameters (force-velocity-power profile) based on two different training protocols: (i) loads that represented maximum power output (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt;) and a 50% decrease in maximum unresisted sprinting velocity and (ii) lighter loads that represented a 10% decrease in maximum unresisted sprinting velocity, as drawn from previous research (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Soccer [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15 male] and rugby [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21; 9 male and 12 female] club-level athletes were individually assessed for horizontal force-velocity and load-velocity profiles using a battery of resisted sprints, sled or robotic resistance respectively. Athletes then performed a 12-session resisted (10 × 20-m; and pre- post-profiling) sprint training intervention following the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; training protocols had minor effects on sprinting performance (average of -1.4 to -2.3% split-times respectively), and provided trivial, small and unclear changes in mechanical sprinting parameters. Unexpectedly, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; impacted velocity dominant variables to a greater degree than &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (trivial benefit in maximum velocity; small increase in slope of the force-velocity relationship), while &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; improved force and power dominant metrics (trivial benefit in maximal power; small benefit in maximal effectiveness of ground force orientation).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Both resisted-sprint training protocols were likely to improve performance after a short training intervention in already sprint trained athletes.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence rate and associated factors of co-morbid mental disability among the elderly with motor disability. Data was obtained from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability (CNSSD). 250,752 older adults aged 65 years and above were sampled from 5964 sites, 2980 towns, 734 counties in 31 provinces in China. Descriptive statistics were used for population-weighted numbers and prevalence of co-morbid mental disability by different characteristics. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the association between mental disability, and the factors of co-morbid mental disability among physical disability. Among the elderly with motor disability, 275,607 persons (2.28%, 99% CI: 1.97–2.59) had co-morbid mental disability at the survey time, which was significantly higher than those without motor disability (OR: 2.11, 99% CI: 1.83–2.43). The factors associated with a higher risk of co-morbid mental disability included urban areas (OR: 1.38; 99% CI: 1.04–1.84), east (2.60, 1.76–3.83) or west (1.65, 1.06–2.55) regions, having other co-morbid disabilities (5.93, 4.48–7.85), and having more severe motor disability (Moderate: 1.81, 1.28–2.57; Severe: 2.90, 2.08–4.04; Extremely severe: 4.22, 2.96–6.01). The elderly with motor disability have a high risk of co-morbid mental disability, especially for higher socioeconomic groups. These findings highlight the need of and will be beneficial for implementing more comprehensive prevention and rehabilitation strategies, to prevent and control the emergence and development of multiple disabilities and promote the physical and mental health of the elderly.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Chao Guo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195555</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d740:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>4c1b2e96</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guo, Ping He, Xinming Song, Gong Chen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Measures were collected at 554 visits over 48 months at one of three imaging sites. Fat fraction was measured in the soleus and vastus lateralis using MR spectroscopy, while T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was assessed using MRI in eight lower extremity muscles. Ambulatory function was measured using the 10m walk/run, climb four stairs, supine to stand, and six minute walk tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significant correlations were found between all qMR and functional measures. Vastus lateralis qMR measures correlated most strongly to functional endpoints (|ρ| = 0.68–0.78), although measures in other rapidly progressing muscles including the biceps femoris (|ρ| = 0.63–0.73) and peroneals (|ρ| = 0.59–0.72) also showed strong correlations. Quantitative MR biomarkers were excellent indicators of loss of functional ability and correlated with qualitative measures of function.

Agricultural crops play an important role in the global carbon and water cycle. Global climate change scenarios predict enhanced water scarcity and altered precipitation pattern in many parts of the world. Hence, a mechanistic understanding of water fluxes, productivity and water use efficiency of cultivated crops is of major importance, i.e. to adapt management practices. We compared water and carbon fluxes of paddy and rainfed rice by canopy scale gas exchange measurements, crop growth, daily evapotranspiration, transpiration and carbon flux modeling. Throughout a monsoon rice growing season, soil evaporation in paddy rice contributed strongly to evapotranspiration (96.6% to 43.3% from initial growth to fully developed canopy and amounted to 57.9% of total water losses over the growing seasons. Evaporation of rainfed rice was significantly lower (by 65% on average) particularly before canopy closure. Water use efficiency (WUE) was significantly higher in rainfed rice both from an agronomic (WUE&lt;sub&gt;agro&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. grain yield per evapotranspiration) and ecosystem (WUE&lt;sub&gt;eco&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. gross primary production per evapotranspiration) perspective. However, our results also show that higher WUE in rainfed rice comes at the expense of higher respiration losses compared to paddy rice (26% higher on average). Hence, suggestions on water management depend on the regional water availability (i.e. Mediterranean vs. Monsoon climate) and the balance between higher respiratory losses versus a potential reduction in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gas emissions. Our results suggest that a shift from rainfed/unsaturated soil to waterlogged paddy conditions after closure of the rice canopy might be a good compromise towards a sustainable use of water while preserving grain yield, particularly for water-limited production areas.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Bhone Nay‐Htoon</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd070:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>5630449</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bhone Nay‐Htoon, Wei Xue, Steve Lindner, Matthias Cuntz, Jonghan Ko, John Tenhunen, Christiane Werner, Maren Dubbert&lt;/p&gt;

The performance of DIA-NN demonstrates that deep learning provides opportunities to boost the analysis of data-independent acquisition workflows in proteomics.</description><published>1521097200000</published><title>DIA-NN: Deep neural networks substantially improve the identification performance of Data-independent acquisition (DIA) in proteomics [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31867</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31867</link><crawled>1522930738127</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522886400000</published><author><name>st2744@columbia.edu (Amir Momen-Roknabadi)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31867</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16295bee3cf:a178316:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31867</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>dbd3e859</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item><item>Genes and Chromosomes</item></keywords><description>Cells adapt to familiar changes in their environment by activating predefined regulatory programs that establish adaptive gene expression states.

Discovery of copy number variations (CNVs), a major category of structural variations, have dramatically changed our understanding of differences between individuals and provide an alternate paradigm for the genetic basis of human diseases. CNVs include both copy gain and copy loss events and their detection genome-wide is now possible using high-throughput, low-cost next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. However, accurate detection of CNVs from NGS data is not straightforward due to non-uniform coverage of reads resulting from various systemic biases. We have developed an integrated platform, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV, to handle some of these issues in CNV detection in whole genome NGS data. It has a modular framework comprising five major modules: data pre-treatment, segmentation, variant calling, annotation and visualization. An important feature of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV is the functional annotation module that enables the user to identify and prioritize CNVs encompassing various functional elements, genomic features and disease-associations. Parallelization of the segmentation algorithms makes the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV platform even accessible on a desktop. Here we show the effect of sequencing coverage, read length, bin size, data pre-treatment and segmentation approaches on accurate detection of the complete spectrum of CNVs. Performance of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV is evaluated on both simulated data and real data for different sequencing depths. It is an open-source integrated pipeline available at https://github.com/vogetihrsh/icopydav and as Docker’s image at http://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/icopydav/.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Prashanthi Dharanipragada</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195334</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4611:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>b0ae3867</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Prashanthi Dharanipragada, Sriharsha Vogeti, Nita Parekh&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper, a wide-band low cross polarization antenna with a structure of microstrip line coupling to slot line as the balun is proposed. The radiation part of the antenna is fed by two pairs of parallel transmission line via a transition from a slot line which is coupled by a microstrip line. Because it is fed by parallel transmission lines, which is balanced-fed structure, the antenna can achieve an improved low cross-polarization performance.

Background &lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks have occurred in some countries despite supplementary immunization activities (SIA) using measles-containing vaccine with high vaccination coverage. We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey to estimate population immunity in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic where repeated mass immunization has failed to eliminate measles.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;In this nationwide multistage cluster sampling survey conducted in 2014 based on probability proportionate to size sampling, blood samples were collected from 2,135 children and adults living in 52 randomly selected villages. Anti-measles and anti-rubella IgG were measured, and IgG prevalence was calculated. We applied mathematical modelling to estimate the number of cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in 2013 that were averted by the 2011 SIA. A stability testing was applied to the MR vaccine at 4°C, 25°C, and 35°C to examine stability differences between measles and rubella vaccine components. Measles IgG prevalence was significantly lower in the target age groups (5–21 years) of the 2011 SIA using a combination vaccine for measles and rubella vaccine (MR vaccine) than in young adults (22–39 years) (86.8% [95% CI: 83.0–90.6] vs. 99.0% [98.3–99.8]; p&amp;lt;0.001), whereas rubella IgG prevalence was significantly higher (88.2% [84.5–91.8] vs. 74.6% [70.7–78.5]; p&amp;lt;0.001). In the SIA target age groups, prevalence of measles IgG, but not rubella IgG, increased with age. CRS cases prevented in 2013 ranged from 16 [0–50] to 92 [32–180] if the force of infection had remained unchanged or had been reduced by 75%, respectively.

Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a risk factor of osteoporotic fracture (OF). Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) can differentiate into osteoclasts to resorb bone. It was known that PBM-expressed Anxa2 protein is associated with BMD, and extracellular Anxa2 protein promotes osteoclastogenesis. This study aimed to test 1) whether Anxa2 protein level in PBM differs significantly between subjects with OF and without fracture history (NF); 2) whether Anxa2 level in plasma is associated with BMD; 3) how Anxa2 protein at various concentrations would affect osteoblastic activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. All the study subjects were Chinese Han elderly. Firstly, Anxa2 protein in PBM was identified and quantitated by LC-MS/MS and compared between 45 OF cases and 42 healthy controls. Secondly, plasma Anxa2 protein level was quantitated by ELISA and compared between unrelated subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD (0.63±0.10 vs. 1.05±0.10 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, n = 75). Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; functional assay was utilized to test the effects of extracellular Anxa2 protein on osteoblastic growth. We found that Anxa2 protein expression in PBM was significantly up-regulated in OF vs. NF subjects (fold change [FC)] = 1.16, P&amp;lt;0.05). Plasma Anxa2 protein concentration (range: 31.69–227.35ng/ml) was significantly elevated in low vs. high BMD subjects (84.85 vs. 66.15ng/ml, FC = 1.28, P&amp;lt;0.05). Cellular dynamical monitoring demonstrated that the general shape of dose-response relationship is the inverse U-shaped curve. Specifically, lower dose of Anxa2 protein may promote osteoblast growth and the optimal concentration for osteoblastic growth was around 50ng/ml, but even higher concentration could attenuate hFOB1.19 osteoprogenitor cell growth. We concluded that Anxa2 protein could attenuate osteoblast growth and be associated with hip BMD and OF in Chinese elderly.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Xu Zhou</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194781</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51d1:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>2885684e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xu Zhou, Long-Fei Wu, Wen-Yu Wang, Xin Lu, Zhen-Huan Jiang, Yun-Hong Zhang, Ding-Hua Jiang, Jian-Nong Jiang, Hong-Qing Gao, Shu-Feng Lei, Fei-Yan Deng&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Polypharmacy is common among older adults. However, little is known about the composition of polypharmacy: which are the most frequently used drugs, and how much do these drugs contribute to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 822,619 Swedes aged ≥75 years was identified from the Total Population Register. Through record-linkage with the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and the Social Services Register we could analyze concurrent drug use in the entire population (both individuals living in the community and institution) on the 31 December 2013.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of polypharmacy (≥5 drugs) was 45%. The most frequently used drugs were cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, and psychotropics. By excluding the ten most frequently used drug classes or compounds, the prevalence of polypharmacy was reduced by 69% and 51% respectively. The majority of the users of either one of the 10 most frequently used drugs concurrently used at least 4 other drug classes (66%-85%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Almost half of the individuals aged ≥75 years are exposed to polypharmacy in Sweden. A handful of drugs make a large contribution to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy and the majority of drugs prescribed to persons aged ≥75 years are used in combination with other drugs.

Despite increasing ability to store and analyze large amounts of data for organismal and ecological studies, the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images has largely remained time consuming and error-prone, particularly for tasks for which automation is difficult or impossible. Improving the efficiency of these tasks, which allows for more high quality data to be collected in a shorter amount of time, is therefore a high priority. The open-source web application, webpic, implements common web languages and widely available libraries and productivity apps to streamline the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images. In this paper, I introduce the framework of webpic and demonstrate one readily available feature of this application, linear measurements, using fossil leaf specimens. This application fills the gap between workflows accomplishable by individuals through existing software and those accomplishable by large, unmoderated crowds. It demonstrates that flexible web languages can be used to streamline time-intensive research tasks without the use of specialized equipment or proprietary software and highlights the potential for web resources to facilitate data collection in research tasks and outreach activities with improved efficiency.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Lucy M.

Spawning ground of Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) is located near the West Mariana Ridge seamount. The species travels through the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and then enters the Kuroshio Current (KC) on the migration toward East Asian growth habitats. Therefore, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events serve as the potentially important drivers of interannual variability across the equatorial Pacific. Because the NEC bifurcation and salinity profiles are related to ENSO events, we investigated the influence of locations of the NEC bifurcation and salinity front on the success of larval entry to the KC by numerically modeling particle transport in ocean currents from 1972 to 2013 and possible effects on the size of glass eels at continental recruitment and, via otolithometry on the duration of larval migration. Circulation and hydrography used for particle tracking were obtained from the results of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) high-resolution forecasting experiment. Our results demonstrated that during El Niño years, (1) the southward movement of the salinity front might cause the larvae to experience slower currents and (2) the northward movement of the NEC bifurcation might broaden the separation between their spawning ground and NEC bifurcation, thus prolonging the time needed for the larvae to enter the KC from their spawning ground, because of which the duration of entrainment in the water column and body size increase when eels reach estuarine waters. In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Kuan-Mei Hsiung</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195544</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b3:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>2467dea2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Mei Hsiung, Shingo Kimura, Yu-San Han, Aigo Takeshige, Yoshiyuki Iizuka&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</description><published>1523394000000</published><title>Effect of ENSO events on larval and juvenile duration and transport of Japanese eel (&amp;lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.49</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.49</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/_0KcAY3-pTA/nrd.2018.49</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sepsis: Gut bacteria induce protective IgA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sepsis: Gut bacteria induce protective IgA, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.49&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sepsis: Gut bacteria induce protective IgA&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/_0KcAY3-pTA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Sarah Crunkhorn</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.49</link><id>YLwIhSxZAzQIEnJq1FGGcXUQMCbQUlr9cyNMExMVeyY=_1626b359a97:669eb41:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522217097879</crawled><fingerprint>40a22de2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sepsis: Gut bacteria induce protective IgA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sepsis: Gut bacteria induce protective IgA, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.49&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sepsis: Gut bacteria induce protective IgA&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/_0KcAY3-pTA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1522220400000</published><title>Sepsis: Gut bacteria induce protective IgA</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/eaat7648?rss=1</originId><published>1523554636000</published><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/eaat7648?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/eaat7648.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/eaat7648?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:feceb5:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><fingerprint>4d78b666</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Erratum for the Report &quot;Predicting reaction performance in C-N cross-coupling using machine learning&quot; by D.

Across all families of enzymes, only a dozen or so distinct classes of non-natural small molecule activators have been characterized, with only four known modes of activation among them. All of these modes of activation rely on naturally evolved binding sites that trigger global conformational changes. Among the enzymes that are of greatest interest for small molecule activation are the seven sirtuin enzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-dependent protein deacylases that play a central role in the regulation of healthspan and lifespan in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. However, there is currently no understanding of how to design sirtuin-activating compounds beyond allosteric activators of SIRT1-catalyzed reactions that are limited to particular substrates. Here, we introduce a general mode of sirtuin activation that is distinct from the known modes of enzyme activation. Based on the conserved mechanism of sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation reactions, we establish biophysical properties of small molecule modulators that can in principle result in enzyme activation for diverse sirtuins and substrates. Building upon this framework, we propose strategies for the identification, characterization and evolution of hits for mechanism-based enzyme activating compounds.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Xiangying Guan</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194175</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849da:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>bb1d0c1d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiangying Guan, Alok Upadhyay, Sudipto Munshi, Raj Chakrabarti&lt;/p&gt;

A screen of itch-inducing compounds (pruritogens) in zebrafish larvae yielded a single pruritogen, the TLR7 agonist imiquimod, that elicited a somatosensory neuron response. Imiquimod induced itch-like behaviors in zebrafish distinct from those induced by the noxious TRPA1 agonist, allyl isothiocyanate. In the zebrafish, imiquimod-evoked somatosensory neuronal responses and behaviors were entirely dependent upon TRPA1, while in the mouse TRPA1 was required for the direct activation of somatosensory neurons and partially responsible for behaviors elicited by this pruritogen. Imiquimod was found to be a direct but weak TRPA1 agonist that activated a subset of TRPA1 expressing neurons. Imiquimod-responsive TRPA1 expressing neurons were significantly more sensitive to noxious stimuli than other TRPA1 expressing neurons. Together, these results suggest a model for selective itch via activation of a specialized subpopulation of somatosensory neurons with a heightened sensitivity to noxious stimuli.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Little is known about the capacity of lower vertebrates to experience itch.

A set of 908 clinically derived colistin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaeae&lt;/i&gt; isolates collected worldwide in 2014–2016 were screened for the presence of the plasmid-borne &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1, &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-2, &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-3, &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-4 and &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-5 genes. In total 3.2% (29/908) of the collection were positive for &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;, including 27 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;1 Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and 1 &lt;i&gt;Enterobacter cloacae&lt;/i&gt;. Twenty-four isolates possessed genes from the &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1 family, including the original &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1 (n = 22), as well as &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1.2 (n = 1) and &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1.5 (n = 1), which each differ from &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1 by encoding single amino acid variations. Genes from the &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;3 family were found in isolates from Thailand, including &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;3.1 (n = 3) and &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;3.2 (n = 1). An &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection in Colombia contained the recently discovered &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-5. The full colistin-resistant collection was tested against a panel of antimicrobial agents with ceftazidime-avibactam and tigecycline exhibiting the highest activity.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Mark G.

A set of 908 clinically derived colistin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaeae&lt;/i&gt; isolates collected worldwide in 2014–2016 were screened for the presence of the plasmid-borne &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1, &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-2, &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-3, &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-4 and &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-5 genes. In total 3.2% (29/908) of the collection were positive for &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;, including 27 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;1 Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and 1 &lt;i&gt;Enterobacter cloacae&lt;/i&gt;. Twenty-four isolates possessed genes from the &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1 family, including the original &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1 (n = 22), as well as &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1.2 (n = 1) and &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1.5 (n = 1), which each differ from &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-1 by encoding single amino acid variations. Genes from the &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;3 family were found in isolates from Thailand, including &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;3.1 (n = 3) and &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;3.2 (n = 1). An &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection in Colombia contained the recently discovered &lt;i&gt;mcr&lt;/i&gt;-5. The full colistin-resistant collection was tested against a panel of antimicrobial agents with ceftazidime-avibactam and tigecycline exhibiting the highest activity.</description><published>1522702800000</published><title>Prevalence of &amp;lt;i&gt;mcr&amp;lt;/i&gt;-type genes among colistin-resistant &amp;lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&amp;lt;/i&gt; collected in 2014-2016 as part of the INFORM global surveillance program</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017165?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017165?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017165?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/10&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 10&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1520827051000</published><author><name>Itay Azizi</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1622364c343:d036a:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521012228931</crawled><fingerprint>1852d682</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Composition, morphology, and growth of clusters in a gas of particles with random interactions</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24067-x</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24067-x</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/soH7Zn1I0cE/s41598-018-24067-x</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improving treatment outcome assessment in a mouse tuberculosis model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving treatment outcome assessment in a mouse tuberculosis model, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24067-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24067-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Improving treatment outcome assessment in a mouse tuberculosis model&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/soH7Zn1I0cE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>489</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24067-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24067_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><author><name>Bas C.

Background &lt;p&gt;China is the largest developing country with a relatively developed public health system. To further prevent and eliminate the spread of infectious diseases, China has listed 39 notifiable infectious diseases characterized by wide prevalence or great harm, and classified them into classes A, B, and C, with severity decreasing across classes. Class A diseases have been almost eradicated in China, thus making class B diseases a priority in infectious disease prevention and control. In this retrospective study, we analyze the spatial distribution patterns of 12 class B notifiable infectious diseases that remain active all over China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Global and local Moran’s I and corresponding graphic tools are adopted to explore and visualize the global and local spatial distribution of the incidence of the selected epidemics, respectively. Inter-correlations of clustering patterns of each pair of diseases and a cumulative summary of the high/low cluster frequency of the provincial units are also provided by means of figures and maps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 12 most commonly notifiable class B infectious diseases, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis show high incidence rates and account for more than half of the reported cases. Almost all the diseases, except pertussis, exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation at the provincial level. All diseases feature varying spatial concentrations. Nevertheless, associations exist between spatial distribution patterns, with some provincial units displaying the same type of cluster features for two or more infectious diseases. Overall, high–low (unit with high incidence surrounded by units with high incidence, the same below) and high–high spatial cluster areas tend to be prevalent in the provincial units located in western and southwest China, whereas low–low and low–high spatial cluster areas abound in provincial units in north and east China.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Despite the various distribution patterns of 12 class B notifiable infectious diseases, certain similarities between their spatial distributions are present. Substantial evidence is available to support disease-specific, location-specific, and disease-combined interventions. Regarding provinces that show high–high/high–low patterns of multiple diseases, comprehensive interventions targeting different diseases should be established. As to the adjacent provincial units revealing similar patterns, coordinated actions need to be taken across borders.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Bin Zhu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195568</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d742:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>e4755446</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bin Zhu, Yang Fu, Jinlin Liu, Ying Mao&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in some patients who achieve sustained virological response (SVR) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection via anti-HCV therapy. To examine the pathogenesis of HCC development after HCV eradication, histopathological changes and clinical markers were evaluated in SVR patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Of 654 SVR patients treated with interferon (IFN)-based therapies, 34 patients who had undergone liver biopsy before initiating IFN therapy and after SVR achievement were enrolled: 11 patients with HCC and 23 patients without HCC (male/female, 9/2 and 8/15, respectively: age, 58 ± 5 and 54 ± 11 years, respectively). We compared the clinical and histopathological factors between the two groups. Immunohistochemistry for Cytoglobin (CYGB) and α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was also performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At baseline, prior to initiating the IFN-based therapy, there were significant differences between the SVR-non-HCC and SVR-HCC groups in the male gender, HBc antibody positivity, prothrombin activity, and histological inflammatory grade. Histopathological evaluation, using the new Inuyama classification system, revealed an improvement in the inflammatory grade, from 2.1 ± 0.6 to 1.0 ± 0.6 (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), whereas the fibrosis stage remained unchanged, from 2.3 ± 0.9 to 2.0 ± 1.2 (p = 0.2749), during the 97 ± 72-month observation period in the SVR-HCC group. Both the grade and stage scores were significantly improved in the SVR-non-HCC group. The area of collagen deposition, evaluated using Sirius red staining, showed a marked decrease, from 18.6 ± 7.6% to 7.7 ± 4.6%, in the SVR-non-HCC group, with no change in the SVR-HCC group. CYGB- and α-SMA-positive hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), indicative of the HSC activated phenotype, remained in the fibrotic tissue of livers among patients in the SVR-HCC group.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Stagnation of fibrosis regression is associated with a high risk for HCC after SVR.

In a search for new potential multitarget anti-HIV compounds from natural products, we have identified in &lt;i&gt;Hypericum scruglii&lt;/i&gt;, an endemic and exclusive species of Sardinia (Italy), a potent plant lead. The phytochemical study of the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from its leaves led to the isolation of its most abundant secondary metabolites, belonging to different chemical classes. In particular, three phloroglucinols derivatives were identified, confirming their significance as chemotaxonomic markers of the &lt;i&gt;Hypericum&lt;/i&gt; genus. Among them, the 3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol was reported here for the first time. All six isolated compounds have been evaluated firstly for the inhibition of both Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-associated DNA Polymerase (RDDP) and Ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities, for the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in biochemical assays, and also for their effect on viral replication. Among the isolated metabolites, three phloroglucinol derivatives and quercitrin were effective on both RT-associated RDDP and RNase H activities in biochemical assays. The same active compounds affected also HIV-1 IN strand transfer function, suggesting the involvement of the RNase H active site. Furthermore, phloroglucinols compounds, included the newly identified compound, were able to inhibit the HIV-1 replication in cell based assays.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Cinzia Sanna</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195168</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c55:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>144f49c2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cinzia Sanna, Monica Scognamiglio, Antonio Fiorentino, Angela Corona, Vittoria Graziani, Alessia Caredda, Pierluigi Cortis, Mariofilippo Montisci, Elisa Rita Ceresola, Filippo Canducci, Ferruccio Poli, Enzo Tramontano, Francesca Esposito&lt;/p&gt;

Urbanization is a global process that has taken billions of people from the rural countryside to concentrated urban centers, adding pressure to existing water resources. Many cities are specifically reliant on renewable freshwater regularly refilled by precipitation, rather than fossil groundwater or desalination. A precipitationshed can be considered the “watershed of the sky” and identifies the origin of precipitation falling in a given region. In this paper, we use this concept to determine the sources of precipitation that supply renewable water in the watersheds of the largest cities of the world. We quantify the sources of precipitation for 29 megacities and analyze their differences between dry and wet years. Our results reveal that 19 of 29 megacities depend for more than a third of their water supply on evaporation from land. We also show that for many of the megacities, the terrestrial dependence is higher in dry years. This high dependence on terrestrial evaporation for their precipitation exposes these cities to potential land-use change that could reduce the evaporation that generates precipitation. Combining indicators of water stress, moisture recycling exposure, economic capacity, vegetation-regulated evaporation, land-use change, and dry-season moisture recycling sensitivity reveals four highly vulnerable megacities (Karachi, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing). A further six megacities were found to have medium vulnerability with regard to their water supply. We conclude that understanding how upwind landscapes affect downwind municipal water resources could be a key component for understanding the complexity of urban water security.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Patrick W.

To achieve this goal a series of geometry optimization and thermodynamic parameters calculations were performed for γ‐glycine and δ‐glycine structures at different pressure values using CASTEP program. In order to perform most accurate geometry optimization various exchange‐correlation functionals defined within generalized gradient approximation (GGA): PBE, PW91, RPBE, WC, PBESOL as well as defined within local density approximation (LDA), i.e. CAPZ, were tested. Geometry optimization was carried out using different dispersion correction methods (i.e. Grimme, TS, OBS) or without them. The linear response density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) was used to obtain the phonon dispersion curves and phonon density of states from which thermodynamic parameters, such as: free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) were evaluated. The results of the geometry optimization depend strongly on the choice of the DFT functional. Calculated differences between the free energy of the studied polymorphic forms at the studied pressure values were consistent with experimental observations on their stability. The computations of thermodynamic properties not only confirmed the order of stability of two studied forms, but also enabled to predict the pressure at which this order is reversed.

In order to perform most accurate geometry optimization various exchange‐correlation functionals defined within generalized gradient approximation (GGA): PBE, PW91, RPBE, WC, PBESOL as well as defined within local density approximation (LDA), i.e. CAPZ, were tested. Geometry optimization was carried out using different dispersion correction methods (i.e. Grimme, TS, OBS) or without them. The linear response density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) was used to obtain the phonon dispersion curves and phonon density of states from which thermodynamic parameters, such as: free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) were evaluated. The results of the geometry optimization depend strongly on the choice of the DFT functional. Calculated differences between the free energy of the studied polymorphic forms at the studied pressure values were consistent with experimental observations on their stability. The computations of thermodynamic properties not only confirmed the order of stability of two studied forms, but also enabled to predict the pressure at which this order is reversed. The results obtained in this study have proven that the plane‐wave basis set first principles calculations under periodic conditions is suitable for accurate prediction of crystal structure and stability. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><title>Can we predict the structure and stability of molecular crystals under increased pressure?

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. On high-resolution manometry (HRM), impaired LES relaxation is defined by elevated integrated relaxation pressure (IRP). However, a new category of achalasia within the normal IRP range has been suggested.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;HRM was performed using a Starlet device and an IRP threshold of 26 mmHg. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) was performed for cases of achalasia diagnosed using established methods. During POEM, the histology of the LES was assessed. Follow-up was performed 2 months post-operatively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-one patients with achalasia (18 women, mean age 53 ± 18.6 years) were included. Among them, 27 were placed in the IRP &gt; 26 mmHg subgroup (impaired LES relaxation on HRM) and 14 in the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup (normal LES relaxation on HRM). In the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup, patients were older, had longer symptom duration, and had more esophageal dilation. The IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup had the same symptom severity as the higher IRP subgroup and POEM significantly improved symptoms and IRP, although four patients still had severe LES fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The clinical presentation of achalasia has a gap between a HRM-defined impaired LES relaxation, with aging or disease progression considered reasons for a lowered LES pressure. POEM can be a feasible treatment option, even for cases of achalasia with a normal IRP.

Succulent cacti (Cactaceae) are among the most threatened taxonomic groups assessed to date. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity and population structure of a narrow endemic columnar cactus &lt;i&gt;Pilosocereus aureispinus&lt;/i&gt;. This species is only found in a small area of c. 300 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of rocky savanna from eastern Brazil and it is currently classified as vulnerable (VU) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list.

The growing volume and heterogeneity of these sequencing data complicate the further optimization of methods for identifying DNA variation, especially considering that curated high-confidence variant call sets commonly used to evaluate these methods are generally developed by reference to results from the analysis of comparatively small and homogeneous sample sets. We have developed xAtlas, an application for the identification of single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small insertions and deletions (indels) in NGS data. xAtlas is easily scalable and enables execution and retraining with rapid development cycles.

The growing volume and heterogeneity of these sequencing data complicate the further optimization of methods for identifying DNA variation, especially considering that curated high-confidence variant call sets commonly used to evaluate these methods are generally developed by reference to results from the analysis of comparatively small and homogeneous sample sets. We have developed xAtlas, an application for the identification of single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small insertions and deletions (indels) in NGS data. xAtlas is easily scalable and enables execution and retraining with rapid development cycles. Generation of variant calls in VCF or gVCF format from BAM or CRAM alignments is accomplished in less than one CPU-hour per 30x short-read human whole-genome. The retraining capabilities of xAtlas allow its core variant evaluation models to be optimized on new sample data and user-defined truth sets. Obtaining SNV and indels calls from xAtlas can be achieved more than 40 times faster than established methods while retaining the same accuracy.</description><published>1522911600000</published><title>xAtlas: Scalable small variant calling across heterogeneous next-generation sequencing experiments [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00310</originId><author><name>Matthias Roos, Tuo Wang, Alexander A.

Knowing brain connectivity is of great importance both in basic research and for clinical applications. We are proposing a method to infer directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances of neuronal activity recorded at multiple sites. This allows us to identify causal relations that are reflected in neuronal population activity. To derive our strategy, we assume a generic linear model of interacting continuous variables, the components of which represent the activity of local neuronal populations. The suggested method for inferring connectivity from recorded signals exploits the fact that the covariance matrix derived from the observed activity contains information about the existence, the direction and the sign of connections. Assuming a sparsely coupled network, we disambiguate the underlying causal structure via &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-minimization, which is known to prefer sparse solutions. In general, this method is suited to infer effective connectivity from resting state data of various types. We show that our method is applicable over a broad range of structural parameters regarding network size and connection probability of the network. We also explored parameters affecting its activity dynamics, like the eigenvalue spectrum. Also, based on the simulation of suitable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes to model BOLD dynamics, we show that with our method it is possible to estimate directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances derived from such signals. In this study, we consider measurement noise and unobserved nodes as additional confounding factors. Furthermore, we investigate the amount of data required for a reliable estimate. Additionally, we apply the proposed method on full-brain resting-state fast fMRI datasets. The resulting network exhibits a tendency for close-by areas being connected as well as inter-hemispheric connections between corresponding areas. In addition, we found that a surprisingly large fraction of more than one third of all identified connections were of inhibitory nature.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQUjBd7KMBU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006056</href></item></canonical><engagement>31</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006056</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1626369d765:13d2b8:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><fingerprint>cc3e5fdc</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Schiefer, Alexander Niederbühl, Volker Pernice, Carolin Lennartz, Jürgen Hennig, Pierre LeVan, Stefan Rotter&lt;/p&gt;

We applied an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; selection approach using two different plant lectins that bind to α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialic acids to determine which genetic changes of the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus alter hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding toward α2,3- or α2,6-linked glycans. Consecutive passages of the A/California/04/09 virus with or without lectins in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells led to development of three HA1 amino acid substitutions, N129D, G155E, and S183P, and one mutation in the neuraminidase (NA), G201E. The S183P mutation significantly increased binding to several α2,6 SA-linked glycans, including YDS, 6′SL(N), and 6-Su-6′SLN, compared to the wild-type virus (↑3.6-fold, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Two other HA1 mutations, N129D and G155E, were sufficient to significantly increase binding to α2,6-linked glycans, 6′SLN and 6-Su-6′SLN, compared to S183P (↑4.1-fold, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). These HA1 mutations also increased binding affinity for 3′SLN glycan compared to the wild-type virus as measured by Biacore surface plasmon resonance method. In addition, the HA1 N129D and HA1 G155E substitutions were identified as antigenic mutations. Furthermore, the G201E mutation in NA reduced the NA enzyme activity (↓2.3-fold). These findings demonstrate that the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus can acquire enhanced receptor affinity for both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic receptors under lectin-induced selective pressure. Such changes in binding affinity are conferred by selection of beneficial HA1 mutations that affect receptor specificity, antigenicity, and/or functional compatibility with the NA protein.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Nicolette Lee</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195525</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715294:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>4588b250</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicolette Lee, Alexey M.

&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria are able to grow in a planktonic state that is associated with acute infections and in biofilms that are associated with chronic infections. Acute infections, such as skin infections, are often self-limiting. However, chronic infections, such as implant infections, can be difficult to clear and may require surgical intervention. The host immune response may contribute to the different outcomes often associated with these two disease types. We used proteomic arrays and two murine models for an initial, descriptive characterization of the contribution of the host immune response to outcomes of acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; disease. We compared the immune responses between a model of self-limiting skin and soft tissue infection caused by the planktonic form of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; versus a model of surgical mesh implant infection, which we show to be caused by a bacterial biofilm. The significantly altered host cytokines and chemokines were largely different in the two models, with responses diminished by 21 days post-implantation in surgical mesh infection. Because bacterial levels remained constant during the 21 days that the surgical mesh infection was followed, those cytokines that are significantly increased during chronic infection are not likely effective in eradicating biofilm. Comparison of the levels of cytokines and chemokines in acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; infection can provide a starting point for evaluation of the role of specific immune factors that are present in one disease manifestation but not the other.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Rebecca A.

The process of selecting individual trees by humans for forest management purposes is the result of a plethora of factors and processes that are hard to disentangle. And yet in the past many textbooks and other publications have maintained that this selection leads to somewhat unanimous results. In this study, we analysed the data of 36 so-called marteloscope experiments from all over Britain, which are managed by the Ae Training Centre (Scotland, UK). Our objective was (1) to establish how much agreement there actually was when asking test persons (raters) to apply two different thinning methods, low and crown thinning. In addition we (2) were interested in understanding some of the processes leading to certain levels of agreement and in relationships between the agreement measures and characteristics of forest structure. Our analysis was based on multivariate statistics, particularly using Fleiss’ kappa. This was the first time that an analysis of rater behaviour was performed at such a large scale and it revealed that the general agreement in tree selection in Britain was only slight to fair, i.e. much lower than in medical experiments. The variability of selecting individual trees was considerable. We also found that agreement in tree selection was much stronger in low-thinning as opposed to crown-thinning experiments. As the latter is an important method of Continuous Cover Forestry and British forestry is increasingly adopting this forest management type, our results suggested that there is a need to provide more training. Interestingly the different levels of agreement as identified by Fleiss’ kappa could not be explained by measures of forest structure, however, the mean conformity number, a surrogate of Fleiss’ kappa, showed correlations and indicated that conformity increased with increasing complexity of tree stem diameter structure.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Arne Pommerening</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194747</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34af:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>54ebcb40</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arne Pommerening, Carlos Pallarés Ramos, Wojciech Kędziora, Jens Haufe, Dietrich Stoyan&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The growing shale gas (“fracking”) industry depends on a mobile workforce, whose influx could have social impacts on host communities. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively.

Motivation &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can impair cerebral vasoreactivity and is associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. Unfortunately, an easy-to-use, non-invasive, portable monitor of cerebral vasoreactivity does not exist. Therefore, we have evaluated the use of near-infrared diffuse correlation spectroscopy to measure the microvascular cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to a mild head-of-bed position change as a biomarker for the evaluation of cerebral vasoreactivity alteration due to chronic OSA. Furthermore, we have monitored the effect of two years of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on the cerebral vasoreactivity.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;CBF was measured at different head-of-bed position changes (supine to 30° to supine) in sixty-eight patients with OSA grouped according to severity (forty moderate to severe, twenty-eight mild) and in fourteen control subjects without OSA. A subgroup (n = 13) with severe OSA was measured again after two years of CPAP treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All patients and controls showed a similar CBF response after changing position from supine to 30° (p = 0.819), with a median (confidence interval) change of -17.5 (-10.3, -22.9)%. However, when being tilted back to the supine position, while the control group (p = 0.091) and the mild patients with OSA (p = 0.227) recovered to the initial baseline, patients with moderate and severe OSA did not recover to the baseline (9.8 (0.8, 12.9)%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) suggesting altered cerebral vasoreactivity. This alteration was correlated with OSA severity defined by the apnea-hypopnea index, and with mean nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation. The CBF response was normalized after two years of CPAP treatment upon follow-up measurements.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, microvascular CBF response to a head-of-bed challenge measured by diffuse correlation spectroscopy suggests that moderate and severe patients with OSA have altered cerebral vasoreactivity related to OSA severity.

Motivation &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can impair cerebral vasoreactivity and is associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. Unfortunately, an easy-to-use, non-invasive, portable monitor of cerebral vasoreactivity does not exist. Therefore, we have evaluated the use of near-infrared diffuse correlation spectroscopy to measure the microvascular cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to a mild head-of-bed position change as a biomarker for the evaluation of cerebral vasoreactivity alteration due to chronic OSA. Furthermore, we have monitored the effect of two years of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on the cerebral vasoreactivity.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;CBF was measured at different head-of-bed position changes (supine to 30° to supine) in sixty-eight patients with OSA grouped according to severity (forty moderate to severe, twenty-eight mild) and in fourteen control subjects without OSA.

Douchi has been consumed as a flavoring ingredient for centuries. During production of douchi, numerous microorganisms play important roles in the hydrolysis and conversion of proteins and starch, which are related to the quality and flavor of the end product. Therefore, in the present study, the microbial diversity in two types of home-made traditional bacterial douchi from Gansu province in northwest China was studied by high-throughput sequencing, and a corresponding analysis of the bacterial and fungal communities were conducted. The results showed that geography may have impacted the fungal diversity and the bacterial and fungal species richness in the samples. The results also showed that the microbial community was significantly different in samples of different origin and the difference in the microbial community at the genus level was greater than at phylum level. Two dominant bacterial genera (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ignatzschineria&lt;/i&gt;) were common to the two samples, both of which had a relative abundance of more than 1%. Four bacterial genera (&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aerococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Jeotgalicoccus&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in the sample from Qingyang, while another four (&lt;i&gt;Carnobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proteus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aneurinibacillus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in the sample from Longnan. Two dominant fungal genera (&lt;i&gt;Pichia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt;) were shared by the two samples. Additionally, two genera (&lt;i&gt;Rhodosporidium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Yarrowia&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in samples from Longnan. The functional genes of the bacteria present in samples indicated that a significant difference was observed in the bacterial community between samples of different origin. We also found that microbial interactions between bacterial and fungal communities in the samples were very complex. This study provides previously unknown information regarding the impact of the environment on microbial communities in douchi and lays a foundation for further investigations into food ecology in bacterial douchi.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Weibing Zhang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194876</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51d7:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>d4c763b3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Weibing Zhang, Qiaoqiao Luo, Yan Zhu, Jiang Ma, Lei Cao, Min Yang, Pencheng Wen, Zhongmin Zhang, Xiaoling He&lt;/p&gt;

We have previously shown that low frequency ultrasound can release biomarkers from cells into the murine circulation enabling an amplification and localization of the released biomarker that could be used as a blood-based method to detect cancer earlier and monitor therapy. In this study, we further demonstrate that this technique could be used for characterization of tumors and/or identification of cellular masses of unknown origin due to the release of multiple protein and nucleic acid biomarkers in cells in culture, mice and patients. We sonicated colon (LS174T) and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cell lines in culture at a low frequency of 1 MHz and show that there were several-fold changes in multiple protein and microRNA (miRNA) abundance with treatment at various intensities and time. This release was dependent on the duration and intensity of the sonication for both cell lines. Significant increased release in biomarkers was also observed following tumor sonication in living mice bearing subcutaneous LS174T cell line xenografts (for proteins and nucleic acids) and in an experimental LS174T liver tumor model (for proteins only). Finally, we demonstrated this methodology of multiple biomarker release in patients undergoing ablation of uterine fibroids using MR guided high intensity focused ultrasound. Two protein biomarkers significantly increased in the plasma after the ultrasound treatment in 21 samples tested. This proof that ultrasound-amplification method works in soft tissue tumor models together with biomarker multiplexing, could allow for an effective non-invasive method for identification, characterization and localization of incidental lesions, cancer and other disease. Pre-treatment quantification of the biomarkers, allows for individualization of quantitative comparisons. This individualization of normal marker levels in this method allows for specificity of the biomarker-increase to each patient, tumor or organ being studied.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Aloma L.

&lt;i&gt;Camellia nitidissima&lt;/i&gt; Chi (CNC) is a valuable medicinal and edible plant in China. In this study, CNC flowers were extracted with 95% ethanol, then partitioned into dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol, and water fractions, with the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and other phytochemicals in CNC flowers investigated for the first time. Results showed that the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity and highest total phenolic content (TPC) compared with the other fractions. Furthermore, in the ethyl acetate fraction, the 50% effective concentrations (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of ABTS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and DPPH radical scavenging activities were 64.24 ± 1.80 and 78.80 ± 0.34 μg/mL, respectively, and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was 801.49 ± 2.30 μM FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 1,000 μg/mL. Pearson’s correlation coefficients and principal component analyses (PCA) for the TPC and antioxidant capacity of the five fractions indicated that the phenolic compounds were the major antioxidant constituents in the flowers. To exploit the antioxidants in CNC flowers, 21 phenolic compounds in the ethanolic extract fraction were identified by HPLC Triple TOF MS/MS, next, 12 flavonoids were isolated and elucidated, of which compounds 1–5 showed potent antioxidant capacity.

The UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (with five dimensions of impulsive behaviour) is being widely used. One of the handicaps of this instrument is its relatively long administration time. This has led to the development of a short version: SUPPS-P. There are no studies comparing the relationship between the SUPPS-P scores and the original UPPS-P scores. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to analyse the psychometric properties, concordance of person measures, and efficiency of the SUPPS-P compared to those on UPPS-P, applying an Item Response Theory Model. The UPPS-P and SUPPS-P were administered to 455 undergraduate students. Confirmatory factorial analysis replicated structures reported in previous studies: the five correlated factors structure and the model with two second-order factors (Urgency and Lack of Awareness) with Sensation Seeking dimension as a different factor. Rasch analysis show that both of the instruments presented adequate model-data fit. The results show the measurement for each dimension of UPPS-P offered more precision than SUPPS-P. The structure of items location was maintained in each dimension of SUPPS-P compared to the UPPS-P, but with better person and item separation indices of the UPPS-P dimensions. The concordance analysis reveals high correlations values between scores on both versions. From the standpoint of reducing items, it can be considered that the reduced version is more efficient. This study does not support the equivalence of items on the dimensions of Sensation Seeking and Lack of perseverance.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Óscar M.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Despite successful virological suppression, HIV transcription frequently persists intracellularly. In this study, we hypothesize that HIV persistent transcription(HIVpt) may affect to a different extent patients on stable efavirenz(EFV) versus atazanavir(ATV)-based regimens. The role of the expression of drug efflux transporters in HIVpt was also investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We prospectively enrolled 51 virologically suppressed patients on first-line treatment for one year with EFV or ATV combined with emtricitabine and tenofovir and followed them up for one year. Simultaneous ultrasensitive subpopulation staining/hybridization in situ(SUSHI) was performed to identify HIVpt in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells and in the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45RO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell subpopulation. The differential mRNA expression of P-glycoprotein(P-gp/ABCB1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein-1(MRP1/ABCC1) was also evaluated. Univariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate predictors of HIVpt.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell population, HIVpt affected 13/30 of patients on EFV versus 10/21 on ATV. In the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45RO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell population, HIVpt was present in 14/30 of patients on EFV versus 15/21 on ATV. A trend for association was observed between the risk of HIVpt and ATV treatment in the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45RO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell population (OR 2.86, 95% CI 0.87–9.37, p = 0.083). HIVpt status was not associated with loss of virological suppression or CD4 evolution. We found no evidence of differential expression of the drug efflux transporters P-gp and MRP1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Further study is required to evaluate whether the HIVpt profile in specific cell populations may differ across different antiretroviral regimens and to elucidate the potential clinical impact.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Dimitrios Pilalas</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194262</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d66:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>8483c8ab</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dimitrios Pilalas, Lemonia Skoura, Apostolia Margariti, Fani Chatzopoulou, Dimitrios Chatzidimitriou, Olga Tsachouridou, Pantelis Zebekakis, Simeon Metallidis, Maria Papaioannou&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately however, IBD analyses have been underutilized in analysis of other organisms, including human pathogens. This is in part due to the lack of statistical methodologies for non-diploid genomes in addition to the added complexity of multiclonal infections. As such, we have developed an IBD methodology, called isoRelate, for analysis of haploid recombining microorganisms in the presence of multiclonal infections. Using the inferred IBD status at genomic locations, we have also developed a novel statistic for identifying loci under positive selection and propose relatedness networks as a means of exploring shared haplotypes within populations. We evaluate the performance of our methodologies for detecting IBD and selection, including comparisons with existing tools, then perform an exploratory analysis of whole genome sequencing data from a global Plasmodium falciparum dataset of more than 2500 genomes. This analysis identifies Southeast Asia as having many highly related isolates, possibly as a result of both reduced transmission from intensified control efforts and population bottlenecks following the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance.

Unfortunately however, IBD analyses have been underutilized in analysis of other organisms, including human pathogens. This is in part due to the lack of statistical methodologies for non-diploid genomes in addition to the added complexity of multiclonal infections. As such, we have developed an IBD methodology, called isoRelate, for analysis of haploid recombining microorganisms in the presence of multiclonal infections. Using the inferred IBD status at genomic locations, we have also developed a novel statistic for identifying loci under positive selection and propose relatedness networks as a means of exploring shared haplotypes within populations. We evaluate the performance of our methodologies for detecting IBD and selection, including comparisons with existing tools, then perform an exploratory analysis of whole genome sequencing data from a global Plasmodium falciparum dataset of more than 2500 genomes. This analysis identifies Southeast Asia as having many highly related isolates, possibly as a result of both reduced transmission from intensified control efforts and population bottlenecks following the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. Many signals of selection are also identified, most of which overlap genes that are known to be associated with drug resistance, in addition to two novel signals observed in multiple countries that have yet to be explored in detail. Additionally, we investigate relatedness networks over the selected loci and determine that one of these sweeps has spread between continents while the other has arisen independently in different countries. IBD analysis of microorganisms using isoRelate can be used for exploring population structure, positive selection and haplotype distributions, and will be a valuable tool for monitoring disease control and elimination efforts of many diseases.</description><published>1521010800000</published><title>Identity-by-descent analyses for measuring population dynamics and selection in recombining pathogens [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25181?af=R</originId><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25181?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25181?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1521788400000</published><author><name>HarshBhatia

This study included spouses of stroke survivors who also served as primary caregivers. Individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analysed using a thematic content analysis as proposed by Giorgi. Data was analysed and managed using Atlas-ti (version 7.0). This study was approved by our institution´s Complejo Hospitalario de Caceres Ethics and Research Committee.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Spouse caregivers of stroke survivors undergo a process of disruption in their private lives and relationships, marked by their caregiving duties. The experiences of spouses caring for stroke survivors is condensed into topics and subtopics: “&lt;i&gt;Caregiving and that´s all”&lt;/i&gt; summarizes the sense of having no life horizons and also caregiver impossibility of moving away from caring role. Otherwise, “&lt;i&gt;Breaking the couple´s life together”&lt;/i&gt; enlightens the further consequences of stroke in couples shared live biography, which needs to be understood and rebuilt. Finally, “&lt;i&gt;Going through the (non) loss alone”&lt;/i&gt; alludes to how spouses reinterpret meaning of loss, which is not appreciated by others and that refers to the balance between stroke survival and any acquired global disability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive approach to the couple (family), from a psycho-socio-emotional and relational perspective, is essential for ensuring adequate quality of life for people who suffered a stroke as well as their caregivers. Spouses-caregivers must be considered as individuals living a transition process due to their unexpected disrupting change, which nurses should address through a comprehensive and integrated approach focused on transition care. Care resources must be adapted to the interpretation that the spouses have of their caregiving role and their relationship with the different components of the caregiving process.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Fidel López-Espuela</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195190</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f2:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>3070cae8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fidel López-Espuela, Teresa González-Gil, Javier Amarilla-Donoso, Sergio Cordovilla-Guardia, Juan Carlos Portilla-Cuenca, Ignacio Casado-Naranjo&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, “&lt;i&gt;Going through the (non) loss alone”&lt;/i&gt; alludes to how spouses reinterpret meaning of loss, which is not appreciated by others and that refers to the balance between stroke survival and any acquired global disability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive approach to the couple (family), from a psycho-socio-emotional and relational perspective, is essential for ensuring adequate quality of life for people who suffered a stroke as well as their caregivers. Spouses-caregivers must be considered as individuals living a transition process due to their unexpected disrupting change, which nurses should address through a comprehensive and integrated approach focused on transition care. Care resources must be adapted to the interpretation that the spouses have of their caregiving role and their relationship with the different components of the caregiving process.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522875600000</published><title>Critical points in the experience of spouse caregivers of patients who have suffered a stroke.

Scant research is available on the impact of the current economic crisis and austerity policies on inequality in health services utilisation in Europe. This study aimed to describe the trends in horizontal inequity in the use of health services in Andalusia, Spain, during the early years of the Great Recession, and the contribution of demographic, economic and social factors. Consultation with a general practitioner (GP) and specialist, hospitalisation and emergency care were studied through the Andalusian Health Survey 2007 (pre-crisis) and 2011–2012 (crisis), using a composite income index as socioeconomic status (SES) indicator. Horizontal inequity indices (HII) were calculated to take differential healthcare needs into account, and a decomposition analysis of change in inequality between periods was performed. Results showed that before the crisis, the HII was positive (greater access for people with higher SES) for specialist visits but negative (greater access for people with lower SES) in the other three utilisation models. During the crisis no change was observed in inequalities in GP visits, but a pro-poor development was seen for the other types of utilisation, with hospital and emergency care showing significant inequality in favour of low income groups. Overall, the main contributors to pro-poor changes in utilisation were socio-economic variables and poor mental health, due to changes in their elasticities. Our findings show that inequalities in healthcare utilisation largely remained in favour of the less well-off, despite the cuts in welfare benefits and health services provision during the early years of the recession in Andalusia. Further research is needed to monitor the potential impact of such measures in subsequent years.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Juan Antonio Córdoba-Doña</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195293</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c5a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>d99bca9c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Antonio Córdoba-Doña, Antonio Escolar-Pujolar, Miguel San Sebastián, Per E.

Clustering of expression profiles, peak-time detection of oscillating genes, integration with transcription factor network dynamics, and assignment to cell cycle phases allowed us to quantify the effect of genetic or stress perturbations on the duration of cell cycle phases.

We measured time-resolved transcriptome-wide gene expression for wild type and cyclin single and double knockouts over cell cycle with and without osmotic stress. Clustering of expression profiles, peak-time detection of oscillating genes, integration with transcription factor network dynamics, and assignment to cell cycle phases allowed us to quantify the effect of genetic or stress perturbations on the duration of cell cycle phases. Cln1 and Cln2 showed functional differences, especially affecting later phases. Deletion of Cln3 led to a delay of START followed by normal progression through later phases. Our data and network analysis suggest mutual effects of cyclins with the transcriptional regulators SBF and MBF.</description><published>1521788400000</published><title>Roles of G1 cyclins in the temporal organization of yeast cell cycle - a transcriptome-wide analysis [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291047v1?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291047v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291047v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Tumor immune cell infiltration is a well known factor related to survival of cancer patients.

Plant expansins are proteins involved in cell wall loosening, plant growth, and development, as well as in response to plant diseases and other stresses. In this study, we identified 128 expansin coding sequences from the wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt;) genome. These sequences belong to 45 homoeologous copies of &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt;, including 26 &lt;i&gt;TaEXPAs&lt;/i&gt;, 15 &lt;i&gt;TaEXPBs&lt;/i&gt; and four &lt;i&gt;TaEXLAs&lt;/i&gt;.

Real-time qPCR analysis showed that many &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt; were differentially expressed in four different tissues of the two wheat cultivars—the cold-sensitive ‘Chinese Spring (CS)’ and the cold-tolerant ‘Dongnongdongmai 1 (D1)’ cultivars.

Background &lt;p&gt;Image-based teleconsultation between medical experts and healthcare staff at remote emergency centres can improve the diagnosis of conditions which are challenging to assess. One such condition is burns. Knowledge is scarce regarding how medical experts perceive the influence of such teleconsultation on their roles and relations to colleagues at point of care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 medical experts to explore their expectations of a newly developed App for burns diagnostics and care prior to its implementation. Purposive sampling included male and female physicians at different stages of their career, employed at different referral hospitals and all potential future tele-experts in remote teleconsultation using the App. Positioning theory was used to analyse the data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The experts are already facing changes in their diagnostic practices due to the informal use of open access applications like WhatsApp. Additional changes are expected when the new App is launched. Four positions of medical experts were identified in situations of diagnostic advice, two related to patient flow–clinical specialist and gatekeeper–and two to point of care staff–educator and mentor. The experts move flexibly between the positions during diagnostic practices with remote colleagues. A new position in relation to previous research on medical roles–the mentor–came to light in this setting. The App is expected to have an important educational impact, streamline the diagnostic process, improve both triage and referrals and be a more secure option for remote diagnosis compared to current practices. Verbal communication is however expected to remain important for certain situations, in particular those related to the mentor position.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The quality and security of referrals are expected to be improved through the App but the medical experts see less potential for conveying moral support via the App during remote consultations.

Background &lt;p&gt;The impact of obesity on survival is known to vary in different cancers. Advanced biliary tract cancer was rarely analyzed about the relationship between obesity and prognosis. We performed this study to evaluate the BMI and body weight change as prognostic factors for advanced biliary tract cancer patients with palliative chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between January 2005 and December 2016, two hundred and seventy-six patients who underwent chemotherapy for biliary tract cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The relationship between BMI (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and clinical outcomes including overall and progression-free survival was assessed. Additionally the relationship between change in body composition and overall survival was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Median overall survival was 9.7 months for underweight patients, 10.1 months for normal patients, 15.8 months for overweight group, 13.1 months for obese patients, respectively. (p = 0.047) Univariate analysis showed that BMI, stage III, age less than 64 year-old, gallbladder cancer, operation, radiotherapy and ECOG performance were significantly associated with better survival. Compared with normal patients, overweight patients (BMI 23–24.9kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) had a reduced risk of mortality in multivariate analysis (HR 0.632; 95% CI 0.436–0.918, p = 0.016). In the additional analysis for the effect of changes in body weight and BMI to the overall survival, decrease in body weight and BMI (HR 1.410, 95% CI 1.168–1.986, p = 0.046) was associated with a shorter in overall survival.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Overweight status and the maintenance of body weight during the initial period of chemotherapy are important and independent predictors of better overall survival in advanced biliary tract cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Jinwoo Kang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195118</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76921:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>fbc1694c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinwoo Kang, Sang Hyub Lee, Jun Hyuk Son, Jae Woo Lee, Young Hoon Choi, Jin Ho Choi, Woo Hyun Paik, Ji Kon Ryu, Yong-Tae Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Compared with normal patients, overweight patients (BMI 23–24.9kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) had a reduced risk of mortality in multivariate analysis (HR 0.632; 95% CI 0.436–0.918, p = 0.016). In the additional analysis for the effect of changes in body weight and BMI to the overall survival, decrease in body weight and BMI (HR 1.410, 95% CI 1.168–1.986, p = 0.046) was associated with a shorter in overall survival.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Overweight status and the maintenance of body weight during the initial period of chemotherapy are important and independent predictors of better overall survival in advanced biliary tract cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522702800000</published><title>Body mass index and weight change during initial period of chemotherapy affect survival outcome in advanced biliary tract cancer patients</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25174?af=R</originId><published>1522118050699</published><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25174?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25174?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162654e438b:6ce01:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522118050699</crawled><fingerprint>49c718ed</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195422</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195422</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195422</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takashi Ikka, Hiroto Yamashita, Ikuya Kurita, Yasuno Tanaka, Fumiya Taniguchi, Akiko Ogino, Kazuya Takeda, Nobuhiro Horie, Hiroshi Hojo, Fumio Nanjo, Akio Morita&lt;/p&gt;
Endogenous nicotine was confirmed to be present in tea plants (&lt;i&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/i&gt; L.) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of tea samples from tea-producing regions in six Asian countries.

Nicotine contents remained constant during manufacturing of green, oolong and black teas, implying that nicotine is stable against heating, drying, enzymatic oxidation and mechanical damage during processing.

Diverse plant pathogens export effector proteins to reprogram host cells. One of the most challenging goals in the molecular plant-microbe field is to functionally characterize the complex repertoires of effectors secreted by these pathogens. For bacterial pathogens, the predominant class of effectors is delivered to host cells by Type III secretion. For oomycetes, the predominant class of effectors is defined by a signal peptide that mediates secretion from the oomycete and a conserved RxLR motif. Downy mildew pathogens and &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/i&gt; species maintain hundreds of candidate RxLR effector genes in their genomes. Although no primary sequence similarity is evident between bacterial Type III effectors (T3Es) and oomycete RXLR effectors, some bacterial and oomycete effectors have convergently evolved to target the same host proteins. Such effectors might have evolved domains that are functionally similar but sequence-unrelated. We reasoned that alignment-free bioinformatics approaches could be useful to identify structural similarities between bacterial and oomycete effectors. To test this approach, we used partial least squares regression, alignment-free bioinformatics methods to identify effector proteins from the genome of the oomycete &lt;i&gt;Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis&lt;/i&gt; that are similar to the well-studied AvrE1 effector from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. This approach identified five RxLR proteins with putative structural similarity to AvrE1. We focused on one, HaRxL23, because it is an experimentally validated effector and it is conserved between distantly related oomycetes. Several experiments indicate that HaRxL23 is functionally similar to AvrE1, including the ability to partially rescue an AvrE1 loss-of-function mutant. This study provides an example of how an alignment-free bioinformatics approach can identify functionally similar effector proteins in the absence of primary sequence similarity. This approach could be useful to identify effectors that have convergently evolved regardless of whether the shared host target is known.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Devdutta Deb</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195559</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd91:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>48434103</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Devdutta Deb, David Mackey, Stephen O.

Simulation is regarded as an effective educational method for the delivery of clinical scenarios. However, exposure to unfamiliar environments during simulation can cause excessive stress among students, possibly leading to unnatural speech/behavior and poor skill learning (Yerkes-Dodson’s law). Thus, assessing students’ stress in a simulation can provide educators with a better understanding of their mental state. This study sought to clarify stress changes throughout the progression of the simulation by measuring heart rate variability and students’ subjective reactions in 74 nursing students. Heart rate variability was calculated in terms of its high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) components during 4 phases—the break, patient care, reporting, and debriefing. Students were interviewed about stress experienced during the simulation. The results showed that HF decreased significantly from the break to the patient care and reporting phases. Furthermore, LF/HF increased significantly from the break to the reporting phases. Approximately 55 students felt stressed during the simulation, 24 of whom felt most stressed during the reporting phase. Therefore, the reporting phase involved high objective and subjective stress. It may be possible that the educator’s evaluative attitude increased students’ stress. Therefore, a stress intervention during the reporting phase might further improve students’ performance during that phase. The debriefing phase did not significantly differ from the break phase for objective stress, and students did not report feeling stressed. Thus, in this phase, they were released from the stress of the reporting phase and the unfamiliar environment. During this phase, they might be able to learn what they could not understand owing to high stress in the patient care and reporting phases. This study provides objective and subjective evidence of students’ stress during simulation, and indicates the necessity of providing support during the reporting phase and the importance of debriefing when using clinical scenarios for teaching clinical skills.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Natsuki Nakayama</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195280</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4607:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>22a1ebf2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Natsuki Nakayama, Naoko Arakawa, Harumi Ejiri, Reiko Matsuda, Tsuneko Makino&lt;/p&gt;

Our human model of nasal colonization and eradication of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; is limited by safety issues. As rhesus macaques are closely related to humans and natural hosts for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;, we developed an experimental decolonization and inoculation protocol in these animals. Animals were screened for nasal carriage of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; and 20 carriers were selected. Decolonization was attempted using nasal mupirocin (10 animals) or mupirocin plus trimethoprim/sulfadiazine intramuscularly (10 animals) both once daily for 5 days, and checked by follow-up cultures for 10 weeks. Intranasal inoculation was performed with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; strain 8325–4 in culture-negative animals. 11/20 animals, of which 5 received mupirocin and 6 the combination treatment, became culture-negative for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; for 10 weeks and these 11 animals were subsequently inoculated. Swabs were taken once a week for 5 weeks to test for the presence of the inoculated strain. In 3 animals, strain 8325–4 was cultured from the nose 1 week after inoculation, indicating short-term survival of this strain only, a finding similar to that previously found in our human model.

Our human model of nasal colonization and eradication of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; is limited by safety issues. As rhesus macaques are closely related to humans and natural hosts for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;, we developed an experimental decolonization and inoculation protocol in these animals. Animals were screened for nasal carriage of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; and 20 carriers were selected. Decolonization was attempted using nasal mupirocin (10 animals) or mupirocin plus trimethoprim/sulfadiazine intramuscularly (10 animals) both once daily for 5 days, and checked by follow-up cultures for 10 weeks. Intranasal inoculation was performed with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; strain 8325–4 in culture-negative animals. 11/20 animals, of which 5 received mupirocin and 6 the combination treatment, became culture-negative for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; for 10 weeks and these 11 animals were subsequently inoculated. Swabs were taken once a week for 5 weeks to test for the presence of the inoculated strain. In 3 animals, strain 8325–4 was cultured from the nose 1 week after inoculation, indicating short-term survival of this strain only, a finding similar to that previously found in our human model. These data demonstrate that rhesus macaques may constitute a relevant animal model to perform &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; eradication and inoculation studies with relatively limited invasive handling of the animals.</description><published>1523566800000</published><title>An experimental &amp;lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&amp;lt;/i&gt; carriage and decolonization model in rhesus macaques (&amp;lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5028275?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5028275?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5028275?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1521777510000</published><author><name>Dmitrii E.

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine secreted by epithelial and innate immune cells, stimulates such pathogenic T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell responses. We found that TSLP signaling in mouse CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells initiated transcriptional changes associated with T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell programming. IL-4 signaling amplified and stabilized the genomic response of T cells to TSLP, which increased the frequency of T cells producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Furthermore, the TSLP- and IL-4–programmed T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells had a pathogenic phenotype, producing greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 and other proinflammatory cytokines than did T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells stimulated with IL-4 alone.

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine secreted by epithelial and innate immune cells, stimulates such pathogenic T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell responses. We found that TSLP signaling in mouse CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells initiated transcriptional changes associated with T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell programming. IL-4 signaling amplified and stabilized the genomic response of T cells to TSLP, which increased the frequency of T cells producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Furthermore, the TSLP- and IL-4–programmed T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells had a pathogenic phenotype, producing greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 and other proinflammatory cytokines than did T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells stimulated with IL-4 alone.

Background &lt;p&gt;Loss to care is high among asymptomatic HIV-infected women initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. However, whether pregnancy itself plays a role in the high loss to care rate is uncertain. We compared loss to care over seven years between pregnant and non-pregnant women at enrollment into HIV care in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective analysis of all ART-naive women aged 15–45 initiating HIV care at two large clinics in Kinshasa, DRC, from 2007–2013. Pregnancy status was recorded at care enrollment. Patients were classified as having no follow-up if they did not return to care after the initial enrollment visit. Among those with at least one follow-up visit after enrollment, we classified patients as lost to care if more than 365 days had passed since their last clinic visit. We used logistic regression to model the association between pregnancy status and no follow-up, and Cox proportional hazards regression to model the association between pregnancy status and time to loss to care.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2175 women included in the analysis, 1497 (68.8%) were pregnant at enrollment. Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were less likely to be over 35 years of age (19.1% vs. 31.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and less likely to be in WHO stage III or IV (9.0% vs. 26.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Among pregnant women, 106 (7.1%) were not seen after enrollment, versus 25 (3.7%) non-pregnant women (adjusted odds ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.24–3.24). Of the 2,044 women with at least one follow-up visit, 46.5% of pregnant women and 46.7% of non-pregnant women were lost to care by 5 years; hazards of loss to care were similar for pregnant and non-pregnant women (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.93–1.26).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this large cohort of HIV-infected women, patients pregnant at care enrollment were more likely to never return for follow-up. Among those who attended at least one follow-up visit, loss to care was not different between pregnant and non-pregnant women, suggesting that pregnancy itself may not be the main driver of the high attrition observed in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Jonathan Ross</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195231</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7692f:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>e9c8c069</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Ross, Andrew Edmonds, Donald R.

However, the magnitude of the mutation-driven effects on the macromolecular network is yet to be fully explored. In this work, we present an systematic multi-level characterization of human mutations associated with genetic disorders by determining their individual and combined interaction-rewiring, edgetic, effects on the human interactome. Our in-silico analysis highlights the intrinsic differences and important similarities between the pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and frameshift mutations. We show that pathogenic SNVs are more likely to cause gene pleiotropy than pathogenic frameshift mutations and are enriched on the protein interaction interfaces. Functional profiling of SNVs indicates widespread disruption of the protein-protein interactions and synergistic effects of SNVs. The coverage of our approach is several times greater than the recently published experimental study and has the minimal overlap with it, while the distributions of determined edgotypes between the two sets of profiled mutations are remarkably similar.

However, the magnitude of the mutation-driven effects on the macromolecular network is yet to be fully explored. In this work, we present an systematic multi-level characterization of human mutations associated with genetic disorders by determining their individual and combined interaction-rewiring, edgetic, effects on the human interactome. Our in-silico analysis highlights the intrinsic differences and important similarities between the pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and frameshift mutations. We show that pathogenic SNVs are more likely to cause gene pleiotropy than pathogenic frameshift mutations and are enriched on the protein interaction interfaces. Functional profiling of SNVs indicates widespread disruption of the protein-protein interactions and synergistic effects of SNVs. The coverage of our approach is several times greater than the recently published experimental study and has the minimal overlap with it, while the distributions of determined edgotypes between the two sets of profiled mutations are remarkably similar. Case studies reveal the central role of interaction-disrupting mutations in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and suggest the importance of studying mutations that abnormally strengthen the protein interactions in cancer. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing technology that drives precision medicine, there is an increasing demand in understanding the changes in molecular mechanisms caused by the patient-specific genetic variation. The current and future in-silico edgotyping tools present a cheap and fast solution to deal with the rapidly growing datasets of discovered mutations.</description><engagementRate>0.5</engagementRate><published>1523430000000</published><title>Multilayer view of pathogenic SNVs in human interactome through in-silico edgetic profiling [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195550</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195550</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195550</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sang-Tae Choi, Kwang-Hoon Lee&lt;/p&gt;
Both rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) are associated with poor radiologic outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In general, RA patients positive for RF or ACPA (SPRA) are considered to manifest an aggressive disease course compared with seronegative RA patients (SNRA). However, the relationship between seropositivity and measures of disease severity other than radiologic outcome is disputed. In this study, we sought to compare the clinical presentations and treatment outcomes of SNRA and SPRA patients. A total of 241 patients diagnosed with DMARD-naïve RA under either 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria or 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria were identified (40 with SNRA and 201 with SPRA). We investigated the disease activity measures including ESR, CRP, patient VAS, 28 tender/swollen joint count (28 TJC, 28 SJC) and DAS28 as well as radiologic outcomes at baseline, 1 and 2 years after conventional treatment with DMARD. Age, sex and disease duration were similar between SNRA and SPRA. However, the baseline 28 TJC (4.7±2.9 vs. 3.3±2.7, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004), 28 SJC (4.3±3.0 vs. 2.9±2.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) and DAS28 (5.1±1.0 vs. 4.7±1.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.043) components were significantly higher in SNRA than in SPRA. Over 2 years of similar treatment with DMARDs, all disease activity measures significantly improved in both groups. Comparison among populations matched for baseline disease activity showed that ΔDAS28 at 1 year was greater in SNRA than in SPRA (-2.84±1.32 vs. -3.70±1.29, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.037) in high disease activity population (DAS28-ESR&gt;5.1). Radiologic outcomes at baseline and at 1- or 2-year follow-up were similar between the 2 groups. In conclusion, SNRA patients manifested more active disease at baseline, but showed a better response to treatment compared with SPRA. SNRA does not appear to be a benign subtype of RA.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Sang-Tae Choi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195550</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd083:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>32a907de</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sang-Tae Choi, Kwang-Hoon Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Indeed, this is essential for making controlled comparisons between different observations or distributing software to be used by others. Providing this type of reproducibility, however, is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which often contain multiple versions.

Indeed, this is essential for making controlled comparisons between different observations or distributing software to be used by others. Providing this type of reproducibility, however, is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which often contain multiple versions.

Two recent papers do exactly that, and I’m going to propose combining them for even more instrumental craziness. The first covers a class of cellular structure that I had no idea even existed, even though it’s been studied for many years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC372955/&quot;&gt;bacterial gas vesicles&lt;/a&gt;. There are species of aquatic bacteria (and Archaea) that produce hollow protein structures (some 200 nM long) whose walls are so hydrophobic that they exclude water and are too tight to let larger hydrophobic compounds in. What does that leave them to be filled with? Gases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria produce these to regulate their density and maintain buoyancy; they’re basically nanoscale swim bladders. But as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593117301898&quot;&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt; shows, there are people taking advantage of these structures for imaging. The contrast between the gas phase and the cytosol makes these structures available for ultrasound detection, and I have to salute the first person to whom that unusual thought occurred. Micron-scale bubbles (stabilized by lipid or protein) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818980/&quot;&gt;are used as&lt;/a&gt; an ultrasound contrast agent, so it makes sense, and in 2014 a Berkeley/Toronto team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4023545/&quot;&gt;showed that&lt;/a&gt; it works quite well. In fact, different sorts of vesicles from different species can be distinguished by their ultrasound behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could get cells to produce such things for you on demand, you’d have a shot at an ultrasound reporter gene construct (of all things). It’s not easy. The gas vesicles actually need several genes to produce the mix of proteins in their walls, and getting everything to express and assemble properly seems to have taken some experimentation, but a report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25021&quot;&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; shows that conventional disease bacteria can be made to express them and they can be detected in turn to localize the organisms &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these vesicles can also be exploited for another detection method: NMR. Air-filled regions have high contrast in T2 magnetic resonance imaging, and with sufficient resolution, you could pick up these gas vesicles as well. The review paper mentions another possibility – allowing these to fill with hyperpolarized xenon – that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1934&quot;&gt;also been realized&lt;/a&gt; by the same group (now at CalTech). This gives &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490238/&quot;&gt;huge gains&lt;/a&gt; in sensitivity, as hyperpolarized species do (normally only a tiny fraction of the potential atoms can be observed in a regular NMR experiment; this makes everything signal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentioning NMR, though, brings me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25781&quot;&gt;another recent paper&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/02/04/singlecell_nmr_how_about_singleprotein_nmr&quot;&gt;a while back&lt;/a&gt; about an exotic NMR possibility, using spin-defect diamond crystals as detectors, that could possibly lead to NMR detection in very small volumes (such as a single cell or even smaller). Here’s a paper from a Harvard/MIT collaboration that’s taking this much closer to reality. The problem with using a single spin defect center is that while you can detect NMR signals in a very small volume, the resolution is poor (100 Hz or so under the best conditions). NMR-using chemists will recognize that as very fuzzy indeed – you can get vastly better spectral resolution on a 1970s electromagnet NMR, although you’re not going to be picking up any single-cell-volume signals with it, to be fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new paper uses several of these unpaired-electron defects in an array, along with a much fancier overall method (coherently averaged synchronized readout, CASR, which I do not understand this morning well enough to describe). What is immediately apparent, though, is that they’re getting real NMR spectra of small test molecules (ethyl formate, xylene, glycerol, trimethyl phosphate) in picoliter-sized volumes of sample. There are many more refinements that are possible to the technique, and the authors seems hopeful (well, as authors generally are, admittedly) that the method will indeed be able to realize single-cell NMR experiments, multiplexed experiments across parallel detectors for bulk samples, and other completely new fields of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d think that these two techniques would work very well together –  the extreme spatial resolution of the diamond-defect detectors with the gas vesicles inside single cells. (I haven’t even mentioned another NMR possibility that’s explored in that review article I started with, the idea of using aquaporins as NMR reporters). If we really do get down to that kind of resolution, all sorts of other exotic ideas will surely swim into view. This gets to &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6113/1426.summary&quot;&gt;Freeman Dyson’s point&lt;/a&gt; about “tool-driven revolutions” &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/chemistry-galisonian-rather-than-kuhnian/&quot;&gt;rather than&lt;/a&gt; concept-driven ones. Build a new instrument, that does new things and gives you new ways of looking at the world, and new concepts will follow. Let’s see if it works here!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Let’s head off to the outer limits of current imaging technology.

Overall, we believe that this distributed representation of genes may be useful for more bioinformatics applications.</description><published>1521702000000</published><title>Gene2Vec: Distributed Representation of Genes Based on Co-Expression [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31955</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31955</link><crawled>1523016397878</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522972800000</published><author><name>phillips@pboc.caltech.edu (Gita Mahmoudabadi)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31955</canonicalUrl><engagement>2</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1629ad9f436:1f4f43:7c9981b6</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31955</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>33d6653f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Microbiology and Infectious Disease</item></keywords><description>The complete assembly of viral genomes from metagenomic datasets (short genomic sequences gathered from environmental samples) has proven to be challenging, so there still remain significant blind spots in our view of viral genomes through the lens of metagenomics.

In cells with a radial microtubule system, a pivotal role in setting up asymmetry is attributed to the relative positioning of the centrosome and the nucleus. Here, we show that centrosome loss had no effect on the ability of endothelial cells to polarize and move in 2D and 3D environments. In contrast, non-centrosomal microtubules stabilized by the microtubule minus-end-binding protein CAMSAP2 were required for directional migration on 2D substrates and for the establishment of polarized cell morphology in soft 3D matrices. CAMSAP2 was also important for persistent endothelial cell sprouting during &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; zebrafish vessel development. In the absence of CAMSAP2, cell polarization in 3D could be partly rescued by centrosome depletion, indicating that in these conditions the centrosome inhibited cell polarity. We propose that CAMSAP2-protected non-centrosomal microtubules are needed for establishing cell asymmetry by enabling microtubule enrichment in a single cell protrusion.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Microtubules control different aspects of cell polarization.

Background &lt;p&gt;Risk prediction is crucial in many areas of medical practice, such as cardiac transplantation, but existing clinical risk-scoring methods have suboptimal performance. We develop a novel risk prediction algorithm and test its performance on the database of all patients who were registered for cardiac transplantation in the United States during 1985-2015.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We develop a new, interpretable, methodology (ToPs: Trees of Predictors) built on the principle that specific predictive (survival) models should be used for specific clusters within the patient population. ToPs &lt;i&gt;discovers&lt;/i&gt; these specific clusters and the specific predictive model that performs best for each cluster. In comparison with existing clinical risk scoring methods and state-of-the-art machine learning methods, our method provides significant improvements in survival predictions, both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. For instance: in terms of 3-month survival post-transplantation, our method achieves AUC of 0.660; the best clinical risk scoring method (RSS) achieves 0.587. In terms of 3-year survival/mortality predictions post-transplantation (in comparison to RSS), holding specificity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts survival for 2,442 (14.0%) more patients (of 17,441 who actually survived); holding sensitivity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts mortality for 694 (13.0%) more patients (of 5,339 who did not survive). ToPs achieves similar improvements for other time horizons and for predictions pre-transplantation. ToPs discovers the most relevant features (covariates), uses available features to best advantage, and can adapt to changes in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We show that, in comparison with existing clinical risk-scoring methods and other machine learning methods, ToPs significantly improves survival predictions both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. ToPs provides a more accurate, personalized approach to survival prediction that can benefit patients, clinicians, and policymakers in making clinical decisions and setting clinical policy. Because survival prediction is widely used in clinical decision-making across diseases and clinical specialties, the implications of our methods are far-reaching.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Jinsung Yoon</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194985</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4250:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>ed2de656</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinsung Yoon, William R.
